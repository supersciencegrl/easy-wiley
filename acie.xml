         <title>Chroman Derivatives by Group Transposition and Atom Swapping in 1&#8208;Tetralones: Single Atom Editing Enabled by Oxidative Ring Contraction of Benzoxepine Silyl Ketene Acetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom editing of complex molecules is steadily filling the chemical toolbox with site&#8208;selective modification reactions. Herein, a stepwise scheme for carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap in tetralins leading to privileged chroman scaffolds is presented. Increasing the oxidation state at each stage, the substrate scope naturally extends: starting from tetralins via 1&#8208;tetralones and further via seven&#8208;membered lactones, the transformation results in diverse chroman&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids and chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols. The efficiency of this synthetic route is governed by the developed new oxidative ring&#8208;contractive transformations of tetrahydrobenzooxepinones, enabled by intermediate silylation into ketene acetals. The described carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap is illustrated by 40+ examples, including skeletal editing of natural products and short formal synthesis of Heliannuol E. Formation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols tentatively may proceed via original mechanism with extrusion of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Anomalous pH&#8208;dependence of Ru for Hydrogen Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The essence for the classic pH&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Pt towards hydrogen electrochemistry, has been debated for decades. In stark contrast, Ru represents a unique exception by exhibiting intrinsically reverse pH&#8208;dependence among Pt&#8208;group metals, significantly challenging the universal validity of the existing mechanistic system derived from classic pH&#8208;effect. To decode the chemical essence beneath the unique anomalous pH&#8208;dependence, refined multidimensional structural characterizations and electrical transport spectroscopic studies reveal that the electron delocalization on Ru surface enables strong oxophilicity and unique pH&#8208;dependent coverage of OH*, essentially different from the H*&#8208;dominated Pt surface. The enriched OH* breaks the classic pH&#8208;dependent rule by forming hydrogen bond regulated interfacial water structures, thus creating a unique chemical environment for alkaline hydrogen catalysis. By clearly decoding the anomalous pH&#8208;dependent behavior of Ru, our work provides new chances to improve the physicochemical model for re&#8208;understanding hydrogen electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Rigidity&#8208;Enhancement and Electron&#8208;Rich Systems Engineering Robust Carbon Dots&#8208;Based ultra&#8208;Narrowband NIR Emitters for LEDs with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the controllable synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) with high color purity, narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 29, 32 and 39 nm, and near&#8208;infrared emission at wavelengths of 683, 695 and 704 nm. Structural characterization, transient absorption, and temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics were investigated to elucidate the narrowband mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the high symmetry and substantial conjugation of the graphitic core enhance material rigidity with minimal exciton&#8208;capturing defects. The high pyrrole N content increases the conjugated electron delocalization, promoting radiative recombination of confined electrons and holes, thereby reducing FWHM. In addition, the large exciton binding energy, weak electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and simple radiative dynamics of the CDs further contribute to their ultra&#8208;narrow emission bandwidths. The CDs exhibit exceptional photo and thermal stabilities in extremely acidic or alkaline conditions and various organic solvents. No quenching or peak broadening is observed at high CD concentrations, rendering these materials suitable for applications in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Excitingly, CD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000 mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150 h at 300 mA. LEDs utilizing these narrowband CDs provide high&#8208;color purity displays and specific steady&#8208;state lighting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Resonance Hybrid Design for Stable Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules are promising candidates for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs) due to their structural versatility, tunability, and reliance on Earth&#8208;abundant elements for sustainable energy storage solutions. However, achieving stability for organic molecules in aqueous batteries remains challenging due to water&#8208;induced degradation. The conjugated systems with enhanced rigidity such as anthraquinone or phenazine derivatives have shown improved stability, yet often exhibit unwanted restructuring reactions in the reduced state due to overly high electron densities, leading to the loss of redox activity. In the present work, we introduce a resonance hybrid, 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyl substituted phenazine dication (HSPC), whose redox center is distributed among different resonance forms between phenazine and quinone to enable efficient reversible electron transfer in aqueous environments. The electrochemical synthesis, resonance structure, and key properties of HSPC were investigated through a framework of combined electrochemical measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and theoretical studies. A high&#8208;concentration cell based on HSPC exhibits a low capacity decay rate (0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day at a 1.4 M electron concentration). These results indicate the significant potential of the resonance hybrid design to build stable redox materials for AORFBs and other energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive DNA Droplets for Controlling Enzyme Cascade Pathways  by Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of enzymatic cascade pathways is essential for deepening our understanding of metabolic processes and designing synthetic biochemical systems. In this study, we present a novel approach to modulate these cascades using light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets. Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends were designed to form DNA droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable  selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet and visible light stimuli. As a model system, we employed an incompatible enzymatic cascade involving glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and catalase (CAT). Under visible light, the DNA droplets co&#8208;localize enzymes within the compartments, effectively regulating metabolic flux without altering the total enzyme concentration. Upon ultraviolet exposure, the droplets disassemble, releasing the sequestered enzymes and altering cascade dynamics. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated using an alternative enzymatic cascade system comprising galactose oxidase (GAO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and catalase (CAT). This system demonstrates that light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets are a powerful tool for regulating enzymatic pathways, with potential applications in synthetic biology, microreactor design, and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronically Asynchronous Transition State Tuned from Remote Site for Oxygen Atom Transfer by CuII&#8208;Nitrite Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is of paramount interest in biology. Cu&#8208;nitrite reductase reduces NO2&#8722; to NO while alternatively NO2&#8722; can be reduced to NO at copper centre via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to electron&#8208;rich substrate like PPh3. This work demonstrates&#160;tuning of LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy by remote site modification which leads to change in electrochemical property and OAT activity of CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722; involving electronically asynchronous transition state. For this purpose, we report here four CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination sphere but different substituents at remote site. In going from 1 &#8211; 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism which was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states controlled from remote site modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Nitrogen and Oxygen Active Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient adsorbents for precious metals, especially gold recovery, necessitates the integration of multiple critical properties, including high adsorption capacity, rapid adsorption kinetics, and exceptional selectivity, posing significant scientific challenges with substantial economic and environmental implications. Herein, we report a strategy to achieve highly efficient gold adsorption through synergistic effects of nitrogen and oxygen active sites into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs (NKCOF&#8208;77 and &#8208;78) with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites are rationally designed and synthesized via a Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction approach. Notably, the comprehensive gold recovery performance for NKCOF&#8208;77 is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity (up to 3225 mg g&#8208;1), ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5 min), and near&#8208;perfect selectivity (&gt;99.9% with 10 competitive cations and anions). Moreover, the COFs show exceptional ability for gold recovery from real e&#8208;waste solutions, demonstrating tremendous practical application potential. Various experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that strategically incorporating high&#8208;density nitrogen and oxygen active sites is crucial in&#160;significantly enhancing the gold adsorption capacity. This work provides a novel strategy for designing COFs as precious metal adsorbents, highlighting their promising potential for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Oxygen Groups Modified Carboxylic Ester Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) operating at high cut&#8208;off voltages can achieve an energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8208;1; however, they often suffer from severe capacity degradation due to electrolyte decomposition. Herein, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PMA) is introduced as a novel solvent for LMB electrolytes. The unique ether&#8208;oxygen functionality in PMA exhibits high steric hindrance, leading to weak lithium&#8208;ion coordination, which promotes the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the electrolyte solvation structure, especially in the presence of dual salts. A Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery employing the formulated PMA&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates stable cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V for over 100 cycles, retaining 90.1% of its initial capacity even at 60&#176;C. Furthermore, a molecular interfacial model is proposed to elucidate the impact of the designed electrolyte on electrode interfacial behavior and battery performance, providing valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance LMB electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiply Substituted (Hetero)acenes with a Phosphonate Group at the Central Unit as High&#8208;Efficiency Light Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new variant of the Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;Bradsher reaction offers access to dialkoxyphosphoryl substituted (hetero)acenes, especially to previously unavailable three&#8208; to seven&#8208;substituted, tri&#8208; and tetracyclic compounds, and features high chemical yields up to 95%, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (QY) up to 87.7%, large Stokes shifts up to 7943 cm&#8208;1 and very mild, room temperature reaction conditions. The (RO)2P(O) has a distinct effect on the photophysical properties of acenes, increasing QYs by more than twofold compared to identical acenes, not substituted by this group. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, combined with electron&#8208;hole analysis, indicated that local excitation (LE) had the dominant contribution to the electron excitation mechanism, and charge transfer (CT) of about 30% provided the highest fluorescence quantum yields. Multiply substitution of (hetero)acenes bearing phosphonate moiety and electron&#8208;diverse substituents combined with a lower number of fused aromatic rings, appear to be ideal for optimal chemical stability and high photoluminescence. The new, synthetic tool will accelerate exploitation of bulky (hetero)acene emitters for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species via Orbital Rehybridization between Intermediate and Active Site for Selective Methane Photooxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as&#8208;formed ROS by introducing Au SAs&#160;on CuOx/ZnO (Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO&#8208;*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2&#8208;pz and dxz/dyz&#8208;px. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#8722;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8722;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4. Thus, Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856 &#956;mol&#183;gcat.&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence for Methylaluminoxane (MAO) Molecular Structure and Reactivity from Ultra&#8208;High Magnetic Field 27Al MAS NMR Spectroscopy Combined with DFT Calculations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and reactivity of methylaluminoxane (MAO), a reagent of major interest for olefin polymerization, both industrially and academically, has been probed using ultra&#8208;high magnetic field solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy (28.2 T, 1200 MHz for 1H Larmor frequency). High resolution methods combined with density functional calculations allowed for the identification and quantification of five major aluminum sites, providing precise information on the structure of MAO at the molecular level. Based on reactivity studies with THF and [ZrCp2Me2], the main reactive centers are identified as bismethyl aluminum species stabilized via a bridging methyl group from a neighboring Al center, featuring both high chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constants (162 ppm and 27.4 MHz, respectively). The ultra&#8208;high magnetic field NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations combined approach demonstrates the ability to monitor the chemistry of MAO with unprecedented precision, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of its structure and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest Polarizability Directed Molecular &#8216;Freezing&#8217; within Non&#8208;metal Porous Salt Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoreticular non&#8208;metal salt frameworks with permanent porosity have emerged recently as a fantastic platform for molecular separation, but the underlying guest&#8208;framework interactions within their charge&#8208;separated ionic channels remain to be explored. Here, we report the first case of guest polarizability&#8208;directed molecular &#8216;freezing&#8217; of noble gas occurring within a non&#8208;metal porous organic ammonium framework, which bears well&#8208;organized, high&#8208;density chloride anions as nodes. Notably, the framework exhibits a distinctive, thermally&#8208;independent commensurate adsorption towards highly polarizable Xe, while traditional thermodynamic adsorption behaviors are observed for Kr with lower polarizability. A remarkable Xe adsorption capacity of 1.47 mmol/g and a record&#8208;high separation factor of 10.2 are thus achieved in dynamic Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions. The practical potential for realistic Xe/Kr separation from the off&#8208;gas of used nuclear fuel (UNF) reprocessing is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations identify the presence of multiple strong Xe&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl interactions as the driving force within the size&#8208;matching ionic channels of the salt framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermediate Layer&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanoparticles Enable Deep Bioorthogonal Liver Tumor and Vascular Imaging via Switchable NIR&#8208;II Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has become an attractive optical region for fluorescence imaging. However, due to the complexity in vivo, NIR&#8208;II light with various wavelengths for different imaging sences has not been investigated. Here, we found that 1525 nm light is suitable for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging due to low background interference, while its attenuation in vivo makes it unsuitable for deep imaging. The 1064 nm light is suitable for deep imaging. The impact of Yb3+ ions and the proportion of the intermediate layer in lanthanide nanoparticles on the modulation of emissions were investigated. The intense 1064 nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525 nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR&#8208;II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high&#8208;resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high&#8208;performance fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanisms of Micro/Nano Structural Manganese&#8208;Trimesic Acid Coordinations for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleation and growth of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are critical for controlling their morphology, size, and performance. Guided by the crystal nucleation and growth theory, this study systematically explored the effects of the sequential addition of ligand trimesic acid (BTC) and manganese ions (Mn2+), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ion ratio, solvent composition, and surfactants on the nucleation and growth of MnBTC. The regulatory mechanisms of the crystal morphology and internal structure were deeply revealed. Moreover, the established machine learning (ML) model can accurately predict the concentrations of &#8208;COO&#8208; and Mn2+, providing important guidance for the controlled synthesis of MOFs in the future. In practical, the electrochemical performance of MnBTC with different morphologies and sizes was evaluated for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The reaction mechanism of MnBTC during the charge&#8208;discharge process was investigated through a series of in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations, and MnBTC demonstrated excellent energy&#8208;storage performance. This study opens a new window for the precise synthesis of MOFs which show strongly controlled micro/nano structure and coordination environment based on the crystal nucleation and growth theory with the assistance of ML.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemistry&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Primary Alkyl&#8208;Alkoxylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the first successful primary alkylation (or methylation) bifunctionalization reaction of olefins through sequential anodic oxidation in a simple electrochemical system, utilizing quaternary amine salts of acetic or long chain carboxylic acids as both methyl or primary alkyl radical precursors and electrolytes. ((The Table of Contents text should give readers a short preview of the main theme of the research and results included in the paper to attract their attention into reading the paper in full.

Abstract
Here, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono&#8208; or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals.

         <title>In Situ Solid Conversion into Mechanically Adaptive LiF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase via MgF2 precursor on Si Surface in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (~4200 mAh g&#8315;&#185;). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion&#160;(~300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in&#8208;situ conversed MgF&#8322; layer (with coating integrity of 94.6%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF&#8322; layer is in&#8208;situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF&#8322;&#8208;1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 10 C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles). Full&#8208;cell based on the Si@MgF&#8322;&#8208;1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium/Indium Heterobimetallic Alloy as an Effective Catalyst for Reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O Silylation of Ethers with Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging.








Abstract
C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic small molecules as well as polymers. The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes.

Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging. This research advances the development of heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts as an option to enable organic transformations that have not yet been achieved using homogeneous catalysts.

A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy homologues of Group 9 metal carbynes [(Me3P)3Co&#8801;GeAr*] (1), [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;GeAr*] (2), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;GeAr*] (3), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;SnAr*] (5), and [(Et3P)3Ir&#8801;PbAr*] (7) is presented [Ar* = C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(Trip)2, Trip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3]. During these preparations, the tetrylidynes [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (4), and [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (6), were also prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]&#8208;fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar&#160;=&#160;Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (2&#8211;5) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me3P)3(CO)M&#8208;E(&#951;2&#8208;O2CO&#8208;&#954;2O)Ar*] [E&#160;=&#160;Ge, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (11); M&#160;=&#160;Ir (12); E&#160;=&#160;Sn, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (14), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (16)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the Group 14 element. For tin the intermediates formed by mono CO2 addition [(Me3P)3M(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O)SnAr*] [M&#160;=&#160;Rh (13), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (15)] have been isolated.

         <title>Supramolecular Structure Enabled Photo&#8208;Responsive Charge Transport in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable reduction of charge transport in a molecular junction under light illumination is realized in the self&#8208;assembled monolayers composed of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular cages. The efficient electron&#8208;hole pair separation in the excited TPyP cages, combined with the increased energy offset, collectively contributes to the notable reduction in conductance under light illumination.








Abstract
Supramolecular electronics offers a valuable opportunity to fabricate functional devices with tunable charge transport (CT) behaviors. Their diverse and non&#8208;covalent structures allow for precise modulation of CT with external stimuli. Despite their potential, achieving effective CT modulation in supramolecules through external stimuli remains challenging due to a lack of rigid systems with a predictable response to such stimuli. To address this challenge, we explore the use of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular structures and their CT responses to light illumination. By incorporating rigid ligands to increase the spatial distance between two porphyrin units, we diminish their interactions, fabricating porphyrin&#8208;contained cages that exhibit a higher efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pair separation compared to the monomer in solid state. Leveraging this advantage, a more effective photo&#8208;responsive CT is achieved for cages in solid&#8208;state junctions compared to that of monomers. The current through cage junctions reduces upon illumination. Theoretical calculations indicate that the reduction in conductivity arises from an increased energy offset between the molecule and electrode under light irradiation. Moreover, the photo&#8208;responsive CT can be finely tuned by adjusting the metal ion coordinated within the porphyrin and the distance between the cage and the electrode. This research paves a new way for developing supramolecular optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Phase Engineering for Achieving Full&#8208;Color Tunable Emission from Blue to Red and Multi&#8208;Level Information Security in Isomeric Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel isomeric hybrid copper halides, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 featuring identical edge&#8208;sharing [Cu2I4]2&#8722; units, are successfully obtained through optimizing the reaction conditions and synthesis method. They exhibit distinct emission colors ranging from blue to yellow and to red. Intriguingly, &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 shows unique multi&#8208;stimuli responsive properties, making it highly promising for advanced photonic applications, including reversible photo&#8208;patterning and multi&#8208;level information encryption and decryption systems. 








Abstract
The design and synthesis of novel hybrid metal halides polymorphs with full&#8208;color tunable emission are critical for the advancement of solid&#8208;state lighting and display technologies. However, it remains challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we successfully synthesized three new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid isomeric copper (I) halides, namely &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 (where BuPh3P+&#160;=&#160;butyltriphenylphosphonium, C22H24P+), featuring the same edge&#8208;sharing [Cu2I4]2&#8722; units. Notably, the monoclinic &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4, both belonging to the P21/n space group, exhibit bright blue and orange emission, respectively. The orthorhombic&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 with space group Pbca and larger lattice volume shows vivid red emission, thus achieving tunable full&#8208;color emission wavelength spanning from blue (445&#160;nm) to red (667&#160;nm), representing the first instance of such broad tunability through adjusting the spatial arrangement of the organic and inorganic parts. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 undergoes a reversible photo&#8208;induced fluorochromism, transitioning from blue to green. Furthermore, a reversible phase transformation between &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 can be triggered by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. As such, a photo&#8208;responsive switchable system and a multistage information encryption/decryption system are successfully devised through leveraging unique multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based study, combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods, sheds light on the complex recognition mechanism between the intrinsically disordered protein Tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn kinase, highlighting how the multiple binding sites present in Tau make the protein an adaptable recognition surface that can function even when single consensus motifs are eliminated.








Abstract
The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline&#8208;rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.

&lt;p&gt;The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline-rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline-rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn-SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full-length Tau protein by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in-cell FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) methods. Both in vitro and in-cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn-SH3 contacts full-length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate-to-low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non-canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Inorganic&#8208;Enriched Cathode Electrolyte Interphases Enabling 5.1&#160;V Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage (5.1&#160;V) solid&#8208;state lithium battery (SSLIB) with superior stability and rate performance was achieved using an oxidation&#8208;resistant poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE) polymer and lithium difluorophosphate (LiDFP) as a functional additive, which forms a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) stabilizing the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode.








Abstract
Manufacturing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is an effective strategy for pursuing safe, energy&#8208;dense solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs). However, the challenges lie in obtaining high&#8208;voltage SSLIBs due to the lack of an electrochemically stable SPE and the degradation of the high&#8208;voltage cathode beyond 5&#160;V. Hence, we employed quantum chemical calculations to screen a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE, designated as PVTF) polymer with strong antioxidant capability to fabricate stable SPEs for high&#8208;voltage SSLIBs. Furthermore, a sacrificial additive (lithium difluorophosphate, LiDFP) was introduced in PVTF SPE to build a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer to stabilize the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode, which is denoted as PVTF1.0@LiDFP. The Li|PVTF1.0@LiDFP|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cell operating at 5.1&#160;V sustains excellent cycling performance and remarkable rate performance, maintaining a long cycle life of over 200 cycles and achieving a high&#8208;rate capability of up to 2 C. Complementary characterization methods were utilized to dynamically observe the cathode structure and interphase evolution, revealing that the high antioxidant stability of the polymeric PVTF framework and the incorporation of LiDFP additive to form a high&#8208;quality CEI enriched with inorganic components realize the superior performance of Li|PVTF1.0@LiDFP|LNMO cell. Overall, the insights gained from our study provide a solid foundation for the development of high&#8208;voltage SSLIBs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Nanopipette Sensor for Electrochemical Interferent Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel sensor design strategy, integrating two interfaces in series within a nanopipette to create an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;. This configuration addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge of endogenous ROS interference in oxidase&#8208;based sensors, achieving accurate glucose detection within cancer cells despite high levels of ROS interference.








Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;based sensors have been widely utilized for their superior selectivity. However, they cannot distinguish the same kind of redox mediators from different sources. Typically, both the H2O2 produced in glucose (analyte) oxidation by glucose oxidase (GOD) and the endogenous H2O2 (interferent) existing in the detection system can be simultaneously measured, causing inaccurate results in glucose detection. To address this long&#8208;standing and inevitable obstacle, we proposed a new sensor design strategy, a dual&#8208;interface nanopipette sensor (DINS), to shield against the interferent electrochemically. The DINS comprised an anti&#8208;interference interface at the orifice of the nanopipette, and a sensing interface located at the inner wall with a certain distance from the orifice. Anti&#8208;interference interface, functioning as an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;, electrochemically eliminated the interferents with high efficiency while allowed the target species to pass through and be detected at the sensing interface. With the synergy of these two independent interfaces, the GOD&#8208;modified DINS (GOD&#8208;DINS) allowed the accurate detection of intracellular glucose with effectively eliminating endogenous H2O2, facilitating the quantitative study on the glucose metabolism inside single cells. Furthermore, this DINS configuration is expected to accurately quantify more substances, and reveal complex crosstalk interactions between multiple species in the physiological, pathological and pharmacological research.

         <title>Cooperative Photometallobiocatalysis: Nonheme Fe Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Radical Decarboxylative Azidation, Thiocyanation, and Isocyanation of Redox&#8208;Active Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the directed evolution of an underexploited nonheme Fe extradiol dioxygenase, we developed a unified cooperative photobiocatalytic strategy to allow for three types of enantioconvergent radical transformations, including azidation, thiocyanation, and isocyanation. Computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested a &#960;&#8208;facial selective radical rebound mechanism as the enantiodeter








Abstract
Cooperative catalysis with an enzyme and a small&#8208;molecule photocatalyst has recently emerged as a potentially general activation mode to advance novel biocatalytic reactions with synthetic utility. Herein, we report cooperative photobiocatalysis involving an engineered nonheme Fe enzyme and a tailored photoredox catalyst to achieve enantioconvergent decarboxylative azidation, thiocyanation, and isocyanation of redox&#8208;active esters via a radical mechanism. We repurposed and further evolved metapyrocatechase (MPC), a nonheme Fe extradiol dioxygenase not previously studied in new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis, for the enantioselective C&#9472;N3, C&#9472;SCN, and C&#9472;NCO bond formation via an enzymatic Fe&#9472;X intermediate (X&#9552;N3, NCS, and NCO). A range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radical precursors were effectively converted by our engineered MPC, allowing the syntheses of organic azides, thiocyanates, and isocyanates with good to excellent enantiocontrol. Further derivatization of these products furnished valuable compounds including enantioenriched amines, triazoles, ureas, and SCF3&#8208;containing products. DFT and MD simulations shed light on the mechanism as well as the binding poses of the alkyl radical intermediate in the enzyme active site and the &#960;&#8208;facial selectivity in the enantiodetermining radical rebound. Overall, cooperative photometallobiocatalysis with nonheme Fe enzymes provides a means to develop challenging asymmetric radical transformations eluding small&#8208;molecule catalysis.

         <title>A Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Protective Layer Enabling Stable Zinc Ion Batteries through Strong Zn&#8208;S Affinity and Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the strong and spontaneous Zn&#8208;S affinity between Zn metal and S atoms on the polythioctic acid (PTA) chain, a dynamic protective layer that tightly adheres to the electrode surface can be achieved, which delivered a strong adhesion force of up to 10.5&#160;N with Zn metal surface and high mechanical strength (Young's modulus&#160;&gt;&#160;15.1&#160;GPa).








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet Zn metal anodes face issues like hydrogen evolution, dendrite growth, and corrosion. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;healable, adhesive polymer layer for AZIBs by polymerizing thioctic acid (TA) on Zn surfaces. Thanks to the strong and spontaneous affinity between Zn metal surface and S atoms on polymer chains, this protective layer can firmly and dynamically adhere to the Zn surface. Thus, even at a thickness of &lt;1&#160;&#181;m, the protective layer exhibits a strong adhesion force of up to 10.5 N with Zn surface, while the abundant carboxyl groups in the protective layer can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, endowing its high self&#8208;healing property and enhancing its strength (Young's modulus reaches 15.1 GPa). Such a protective layer effectively inhibits the dendrite growth physically and regulates the Zn2+ migration and deposition behavior chemically. Therefore, the symmetric cells can be cycled for more than 1000 h at the current densities of 1.0 and 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Full cells with NH4V4O10 also run stably for 1000 cycles with a high capacity retention. This work offers a promising strategy for designing multifunctional polymer coating towards high&#8208;stability and long&#8208;cycling AZIBs.

         <title>Diamond Chemistry: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their review, Yang, Krueger, and Hamers highlight recent advances in diamonds that impact chemical scientists. Advances in growth of diamonds have yielded improved quality and lower cost, while new and emerging applications in areas such as energy storage, photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalysis, sensing, and quantum science have expanded applications.








Abstract
Diamond as a material has many unique properties. Its high optical dispersion, extraordinarily high mechanical strength, and unparalleled thermal conductivity have long made it a material of interest for applications such as high&#8208;temperature electronics and as wear&#8208;resistance coatings. More recently, diamond has emerged as a material with a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology. The high intrinsic stability of diamond, coupled with the ability to modify diamond surfaces with a wide range of inorganic, organic, and biological species via highly stable covalent linkages, provides a wealth of opportunity to couple diamond's chemical properties with its extraordinary physical properties. The practical utility of diamond has been greatly expanded in recent years through dramatic advances in the ability to produce diamond in bulk, thin film, and nanoparticle form, with controlled doping and purity at modest cost. These advances, together with diamond's highly stable and tunable surface chemistry with versatility of physical structure enable a wide range of emerging applications of interest to chemists, including quantum science, biomedicine, energy storage, and catalysis. Yet, to fully exploit the unique properties of diamond, some formidable chemical challenges lie ahead.
We begin by reviewing some of the features of diamond that are of particular importance to the chemistry community. We aim to highlight some of the important applications where diamond chemistry plays a key role, identify some of the key observations, and outline some of the future directions and opportunities for diamond in the chemical world.

         <title>Dynamic Crystal&#8208;Structure and Active&#8208;Site of Defective ZnAl&#8208;Catalysts During CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning probe spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic crystal&#8208;structure and active&#8208;site evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on defective ZnAl&#8208;LDH photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Understanding of surface defects of a catalyst during the reaction process is critical to establish an accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship. Herein, combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy with scanning probe microscope, we have first established the correlations between CO2 photoreduction activities and crystal&#8208;structure/active&#8208;site of defective ZnAl layered double hydroxides (ZnAl&#8208;LDH). Specifically, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in ZnAl&#8208;LDH could effectively promote the selective adsorption of both CO2 and H2O molecules on surface Al and Zn active sites, respectively, leading to opposite transition states and the evident shrinking of crystalline structures. Under light irradiation, the adsorbed CO2 molecules transformed into *COOH intermediate on surface Al active sites, while the H2O molecules dissociated into OH group on Zn sites to provide proton, simultaneously leading to the expansion of crystalline structures and increase of layer spacing. Accordingly, these defect&#8208;dependent evolutions of surface active sites and crystalline structure contributed to the significant improvement of CO2 reduction to CO activity (17.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), much higher than that of pristine ZnAl&#8208;LDH (6.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides new insights for in&#8208;depth understanding of the electronic and crystalline changes of defective photocatalysts during the reaction process.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Multipath Proton Transmembrane Transport System with Redox&#8208;Switchable Characteristics for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based artificial transmembrane proton transport system was prepared by a convenient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; cationic polymerization method. It produced multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonded chains, leading to effective and selective proton transport, which elevated lysosomal pH and induced mitochondrial damage, finally causing cancer cell apoptosis. By introducing selenide moieties, the system exhibited notable in situ redox&#8208;switchable &#8220;ON&#8211;OFF&#8221; transport activity.








Abstract
Natural channel proteins (NCPs) enable efficient and selective transport of specific species across cellular membranes and exhibit stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors; however, replicating these features in their artificial counterparts poses significant challenges. Here, we report a hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;derived biomimetic multipath proton transport system, H3, by a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; cationic polymerization of 3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;oxetane. H3 efficiently transports protons while rejecting other ions and water molecules by forming multiple hydrogen bonding chains like natural proton channels. Patch clamp experiments revealed that H3 facilitates rapid proton transport (&#947;H+&#160;=&#160;181&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;pS) comparable to that of natural gramicidin A (&#947;H+&#160;=&#160;213&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;pS) and demonstrates high H+&#8208;selectivity, with PH+/PK+, PH+/PNa+, and PH+/PCl&#8208; values reaching 78.4, 233.2, and 167.8, respectively. H3&#8208;induced proton transport causes elevated lysosomal pH and mitochondrial damage, ultimately resulting in severe cancer cell apoptosis (IC50: 0.23 &#181;M for U87MG; 1.04 &#181;M for B16F10). Interestingly, selenide moieties&#8208;containing H3&#8208;Se exhibits an unprecedented in situ redox&#8208;switchable &#8220;ON&#8211;OFF&#8221; of proton transport by regulating its hydrophilicity. This work will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of NCPs and treatments for cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Universal Metal&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Room Temperature Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;temperature limitations of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) synthesis, primarily thermal aggregation and low metal loadings, are overcome by a novel room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;exchange strategy. We leverage the weak Zn&#8211;N coordination in high&#8208;loading Zn SACs (12.1 wt%, synthesized via controlled ZIF&#8208;8 pyrolysis) as a platform for the facile exchange with a broad range of metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pt, up to 12.67 wt%) and the creation of multi&#8208;metallic species. This ambient&#8208;temperature approach significantly reduces aggregation, enhancing the exposure of catalytic active sites and delivering superior multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities (catalase, peroxidase, oxidase). Our work not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;temperature route to high&#8208;performance SACs but also reveals crucial insights into the stability of SACs under metal&#8208;ion conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Negatively Curved&#160;Diaza&#8208;Octagon Heterocycle Fused with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) skeletons with narrowband emission is crucial for advancing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Inspired by the aesthetic configuration of negatively curved octagonal rings and the multiple resonance (MR) effect, we designed a novel diaza&#8208;octagon heterocycle fused with PAHs, abbreviated as 8NN, and&#160;its phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative 8NNP. Crystal data and theoretical calculations show that their peripheral PAHs exhibit significant rigidity, while the internal diaza&#8208;octagon ring confers skeleton flexibility and flipping properties. Notably, owing to the strategic embedding and unique bonding form of nitrogen atoms, their MR effect is significantly enhanced. Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 408 nm and 411 nm, with remarkably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm and 17 nm, respectively, and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron&#8208;functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461 nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31 nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively. These results validate the rational design of the novel skeleton and facilitate the development of narrowband emission materials.</dc:description>

Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep-blue emission peaking at 408 nm and 411 nm, with remarkably narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm and 17 nm, respectively, and aggregation-enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron-functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461 nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31 nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively. These results validate the rational design of the novel skeleton and facilitate the development of narrowband emission materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Compensation Strategy Enables Jahn&#8208;Teller Effect Suppression in Zn&#8208;Doped Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Site CuHCF&#160;Cathodes for High&#8208;Energy and Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with 3D channels and high discharge plateau is widely recognized as a highly promising cathode material for ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) storage. However, the practical application of CuHCF has faced challenges due to limited capacity and structural instability, primarily arising from single active site and serious Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions. Herein, an innovative in&#8208;situ dynamic compensation strategy is reported to prepare Zn&#8208;doping dual&#8208;active&#8208;site CuHCF (ZnCuHCF) as high&#8208;energy and ultra&#8208;stable cathode materials for NH4+ storage. Zn doping induces fission of Cu e2g orbitals, causing lattice to aberrate and reach stable state, while during NH4+ intercalation process, changes mainly in Fe t2g electronic orbitals help maintain stability of ZnCuHCF structure. Consequently, ZnCuHCF in 23 m NH4OTf+0.5 m Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte exhibits high discharge potential of 0.94 V, high capacity of 121.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 and impressive capacity retention of 92.1% after 10,000 cycles. To highlight, fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous Zn/NH4 hybrid batteries based on ZnCuHCF cathode are successfully constructed, achieving admirable energy density of 85.73 mWh g&#8208;1 and remarkable capacity retention of 85.2% after 12,500 cycles. This work paves the way for designing CuHCF with high capacity, high voltage and robust cycling stability in NH4+ storage for applications in wearable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Assisted PCET and Formation of WIII&#8208;OH in Bis&#8208;dithiolene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox non&#8208;innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high&#8208;valent metal ions and facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low&#8208;valent metal centers, as high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high&#8208;valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)&#8208;oxo complexes featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W&#8208;oxo forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene&#8208;sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV&#8594;III reduction at &#8211;1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII&#8208;OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV=O state would populate the dithiolene &#960;* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal = &#8211;3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene&#8208;S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV&#8208;H catalytic species.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trace water is usually fatal to gas separation process because the adsorption sites of adsorbents can be readily devitalized under humid conditions. Here, we develop trace&#8208;water&#8208;buffering porous materials with reversible structural transformation triggered by water adsorption/desorption, achieving exceptional methane purification under humid conditions. Despite the different structures, both the hydrated and dehydrated materials show high adsorption capacities for bulky C3H8 and intermediate&#8208;sized C2H6 molecules but low CH4 uptake. Based on these unique properties, the dehydrated material achieves efficient separation of ternary CH4/C2H6/C3H8 mixtures even under 100% relative humidity, delivering high&#8208;purity CH4 (&gt;99.99%) with a remarkable yield of 7.2 mmol&#8729;g&#8722;1. This work sheds light on the designed synthesis of a new generation of microporous materials with reversible water&#8208;buffering performance for gas purification under practically humid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control over Electron Distribution and Water Dissociation Kinetics in Strongly Coupled Ru@NMoC Hybrid Catalyst Realizes Efficient Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delicate control over electron distribution in hybrid catalysts is crucial for improving hydrogen evolution catalysis, which remains an aspirational target in advancing efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20 mV at 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N&#8208;doping of Ru clusters self&#8208;optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self&#8208;powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn&#8208;H&#8322;O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demoinstrating its practicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Base Electrolyte Additive Mediates Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes play a crucial role in regulating interfacial chemistry, which is essential for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating the simplest Grignard reagent, CH3MgCl, as an additive. This additive, endowed with Lewis&#8208;base characteristics, enhances the stability of the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface through bifunctional effects. During Li deposition, CH3Mg+ preferentially adsorbs onto the electrode surface, attracting more anions into the Helmholtz layer. Concurrently, CH3&#8211; creates an electron&#8208;rich environment, facilitating nucleophilic attacks on anions and promoting its reduction to form an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Additionally, Mg2+ undergoes electrodeposition prior to Li+, forming a Li&#8208;Mg alloy with subsequently deposited Li. This process lowers the nucleation barrier for Li deposition, resulting in improved deposition uniformity. Accordingly, the designed electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability for Li anodes in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cells and full&#8208;cells paired with LiFePO4 cathodes. Notably, Li||LiFePO4 batteries using a thin&#8208;film Li anode pre&#8208;deposited on Cu retain ~92.84% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of ~99.74%. These findings highlight the critical role of additives in engineering interfacial chemistry and provide a promising strategy for designing advanced electrolytes to improve the cycling performance of Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Methanol&#8208;Facilitated Cascaded Polyolefin Upcycling Enabling the Efficient Generation of High&#8208;Value C9+ Alkylaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of polyolefin chemical recycling and upcycling, the economic viability of the resultant products is of utmost significance.&#160;Polysubstituted alkylbenzenes, especially those within the C9&#8208;C12 alkylaromatic range, with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton, represent a high&#8208;value segment with substantial yet unexploited potential for further development. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a co&#8208;reactant, with the goal of achieving high&#8208;yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 &#176;C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt % of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9&#8208;C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation&#8208;mediated C&#8208;C bond cleavage and self&#8208;amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the domain of polyolefin chemical recycling and upcycling, the economic viability of the resultant products is of utmost significance.&#160;Polysubstituted alkylbenzenes, especially those within the C9-C12 alkylaromatic range, with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton, represent a high-value segment with substantial yet unexploited potential for further development. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a co-reactant, with the goal of achieving high-yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 &#176;C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low-density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt % of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9-C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope-labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation-mediated C-C bond cleavage and self-amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway towards the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Supported Metallic Pt Single Atoms in Molten NaAlCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered widespread attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their theoretical 100% atomic utilization efficiency. Isolated metal atoms usually exhibit high oxidation states rather than metallic state owing to the coordination with nonmetal atoms in the supports. Despite recent advances in modulating the coordination environments of SACs, achieving metallic state&#8208;dominated SACs remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new configuration of metallic Pt single atoms (Pt0) anchored on the CeO2 support is constructed by introducing a localized Pt&#8208;Ce metal&#8208;metal coordination at the interface in molten NaAlCl4 environment. The extensive Pt&#8208;Ce bonding and electron transfer from the support to the Pt atoms ensure the metallic nature of isolated Pt atoms. This work opens up a new avenue for constructing metallic single atoms and enriches the SACs chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn Catalysts with Build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722; as Proton Relay for Industrial&#8208;Grade CO2 Reduction at Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) involves multi&#8208;proton electron transfer, characterized by sluggish reaction kinetics and challenges including high overpotential and subsequently poor stability. Facilitating proton transfer through rational catalyst design to reduce the applied potential enables effective and durable CO2 reduction. Herein,&#160;proton migration promotion strategy to accelerate the CO2 protonation and the overall ECO2R process was explored by Sn&#8208;based cyanamide catalysts. Catalysts with varying [NCN]2&#8211; content, from SnO to Sn2ONCN and SnNCN, were investigated to elucidate&#160;proton transfer mechanism of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8211;. The reversible structural transformation between [N=C=N]2&#8211; and [N&#8801;C&#8211;N]2&#8211; from [NCN]2&#8211; group achieves an efficient proton relay effect. More efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH is achieved with a higher content of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8211; groups in structures. Among these catalysts, SnNCN showed a current density of 450 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 360 mV, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.4% for HCOO&#8211; production and a peak cathodic energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 79.6%. Furthermore, it produced formate (HCOO&#8722;) continuously for over 110 h at 200 mA cm&#8722;2 and pure formic acid (HCOOH) solution for 192 h at 135.8 mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides a novel material&#160;and fresh perspective for the design of efficient ECO2R catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Addition of Glycinate to Nitroalkenes by Pyridoxal/Nd Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct enantioselective&#160;&#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes is a significant organic transformation, which may provide a highly efficient strategy to make bioactive chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve this reaction due to the interference of the reactive NH2 group, potential [3+2] cycloaddition side reaction and complicated stereoselective control. Carbonyl catalysis is an effective strategy to activate glycinate by forming an imine to facilitate the conjugate addition. With a pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system, direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C conjugate addition of glycinate&#160;to nitroalkenes has been successfully developed for the first time, producing a broad range of chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 98% ee). The products can be easily converted into various biologically significant chiral molecules maintaining the same enantiopurity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems, but they suffer from destructive dendrite growth. Here we integrate cutting&#8208;edge molecular weaving technology into the fabrication of artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEI) to realize dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lasting LMBs. Specifically, weaving polymer chains into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) plane endows polymer network crystals with high strength and elasticity, and creates angstrom&#8208;level meshes for Li&#8208;ion transport and uniform deposition. As a result, related Li plating experiments remained stable at an unprecedentedly high current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, full cells with &#8220;woven&#8221; ASEI exhibited superior long&#8208;term cycling performance compared to existing 2D materials, achieving a capacity retention of 98% over 270 cycles under stringent testing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Considerations of Ionic Conductive Elastomeric Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Zinc Metal Batteries with High Safety and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8722;ion batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth have impeded their application. In this study, we developed an Zn2+&#8208;ionic conductive elastomer solid&#8208;state electrolyte through the simultaneous hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking between phytic acid (PA) molecules and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The large PA molecules inside the polymer electrolyte are favorable to maintaining stretched conformation of PVA chain and uniform interpenetrating distribution, enhancing the amorphous region of PVA polymer. And the high&#8208;density hydrogen bond network constructed from PVA chains and PA molecules builds a novel transport mode to promote the efficient Zn2+ ion transport, displaying significant ion conductivity of 6.05 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C and a higher transference number of 0.68. The special viscoelasticity of the elastomer facilitates close contact with electrodes, ensuring superior interface compatibility. The assembled Zn symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle life of 2880 h under 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the assembled Zn//VO2 full battery still maintains a capacity retention rate of 86.5% at 400 cycles under 1.0 A g&#8722;1. The development of ionic conductive elastomers offers a novel approach to solve the solid&#8208;state interface design of solid&#8208;state Zn&#8722;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling the SHG&#8208;Birefringence Trade&#8208;off in UV NLO Materials via Triple&#8208;Control Coordination Engineering: Achieving Synergistic Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decoupling the trade&#8208;off between second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (&#916;n) while maintaining a wide bandgap (Eg) is a critical challenge in the field of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In this work, we introduce a novel &#8220;triple&#8208;control coordination engineering&#8221; strategy that successfully addresses this challenge. By integrating dihedral angle modulation, coordination mode switching, and polarizability engineering, we have synthesized three zinc halides&#8212;[(C5H6N2O2)(C5H5N2O2)ZnCl (I), (C5H6N2O2)ZnCl2(II), and (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 (III)]&#8212;that exhibit exceptional UV NLO performance. Through dynamic C&#8208;C&#8208;N bond rotation, we achieved precise control over the dihedral angle (81&#176;&#8594;84&#176;), effectively modulating optical anisotropy (&#916;n=0.048&#8208;0.071@1064 nm). pH/temperature&#8208;driven coordination mode evolution enabled complete alignment of the [ZnO2X2] polyhedron, while halogen substitution (Cl &#8594; Br) amplified polarizability gradients. These advancements resulted in a stepwise amplified SHG response (0.4&#8594;3.5&#8594;8.2&#215;KH2PO4, abbreviated as KDP), controlled &#916;n, wide Eg (&gt;5.0 eV), and remarkable thermal stability (&gt;250&#176;C). Notably, (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 stands out as the first zinc&#8208;based halide to simultaneously achieve large SHG (&gt;8&#215;KDP), moderate birefringence (0.05&lt;&#916;n&lt;0.1), and a wide bandgap (Eg&gt;5.0 eV).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decoupling the trade-off between second-harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (&#916;n) while maintaining a wide bandgap (Eg) is a critical challenge in the field of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In this work, we introduce a novel &#8220;triple-control coordination engineering&#8221; strategy that successfully addresses this challenge. By integrating dihedral angle modulation, coordination mode switching, and polarizability engineering, we have synthesized three zinc halides&#8212;[(C5H6N2O2)(C5H5N2O2)ZnCl (I), (C5H6N2O2)ZnCl2(II), and (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 (III)]&#8212;that exhibit exceptional UV NLO performance. Through dynamic C-C-N bond rotation, we achieved precise control over the dihedral angle (81&#176;&#8594;84&#176;), effectively modulating optical anisotropy (&#916;n=0.048-0.071@1064 nm). pH/temperature-driven coordination mode evolution enabled complete alignment of the [ZnO2X2] polyhedron, while halogen substitution (Cl &#8594; Br) amplified polarizability gradients. These advancements resulted in a stepwise amplified SHG response (0.4&#8594;3.5&#8594;8.2&#215;KH2PO4, abbreviated as KDP), controlled &#916;n, wide Eg (&amp;gt;5.0 eV), and remarkable thermal stability (&amp;gt;250&#176;C).

         <title>Photoacid&#8208;induced Supramolecular Network Disassembly: a Systems Approach to Stimuli&#8208;responsive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of supramolecular motifs allows the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers whose physical properties can be changed by external triggers that affect the supramolecular binding. However, using this approach to create light&#8208;responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, supramolecular polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross&#8208;links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#173;styryl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;bis(trichloromethyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self&#8208;reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto&#8208;rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand adhesives was explored in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Nitriles from Dinitrogen via N&#8208;Atom Transfer on Rhenium Nitride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the reduction of rhenium trichloride or oxo dichloride bearing a rigid acriPNP ligand under an atmosphere of N2, we facilely prepared a terminal rhenium nitride [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl]. Upon reaction with RC(O)X (X&#160;=&#160;OTf, Cl), the nitride directly afforded a wide array of nitriles. Remarkably, these nitrile&#8208;forming protocols concomitantly regenerate the nitride precursors, efficiently completing a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated dinitrogen (N2) splitting into terminal nitrido moiety followed by N&#8208;atom transfer is an attractive strategy for N2 fixation beyond ammonia. While the functionalization of N2&#8208;derived nitride complexes have been widely investigated, their N&#8208;atom transfer reactions to provide N&#8208;containing organic compounds were rarely reported. Herein, we report the synthesis of a rhenium nitride complex [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl] (acriPNP&#160;=&#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)&#8208;2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;acridin&#8208;10&#8208;ide) via reductive N2 cleavage from either rhenium trichloride or rhenium oxo dichloride complexes. The rhenium nitride exhibits N&#8208;atom transfer reactivity with acyl triflates or chlorides under mild conditions, affording nitriles concomitant with the regeneration of the nitride precursors, rhenium oxo or trichloride complexes, respectively. This overall N&#8208;atom transfer from N2 to acyl electrophiles produced a series of alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic nitriles, in moderate to good yields, offering a versatile and practical strategy for accessing 15N&#8208;labeled nitriles. This work established a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle, offering valuable insights into transformations of N2 into nitrogenous products.

         <title>Ammonia Hydration in a Cu(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate Framework for Efficient Trace Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)&#8208;pyrazolate framework enables strong NH3 binding and a high adsorption capacity through a reversible hydration mechanism. It combines the merits of strong affinity, facile regeneration, and exceptional alkaline stability, setting a new standard for energy&#8208;efficient trace NH3 removal.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) emissions from industrial and agricultural activities pose severe environmental and health issues. Trace NH3 capture typically relies on chemisorption at Lewis acid sites or physisorption on porous adsorbents but usually suffers from irreversible binding, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, and structural degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a new hydration pathway as a promising solution. In a Cu(II)&#8208;pyrazolate framework, BUT&#8208;64(H2O), the bridging water molecules between adjacent Cu(II) ions serve as Br&#248;nsted acid sites to hydrate ammonia, achieving a remarkable NH3 packing density of 0.27&#160;g cm&#8722;3 at 0.1&#160;kPa and an adsorption capacity of 1.51&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 for 1000&#160;ppm NH3 under 80% relative humidity, among the leading adsorbents. The reversible hydration mechanism combines enhanced NH3 affinity with facile regeneration and mitigated moisture co&#8208;adsorption, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;off. The remarkable alkaline stability of this material also highlights its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient sorbent for trace NH3 capture.

         <title>Nucleophilic Covalent Ligands Enable Simultaneous Surface Reconstruction and Passivation of Colloidal InSb Quantum Dots for Stable Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simultaneous surface reconstruction and passivation strategy is designed for indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. This leads to stable CQD inks and 1450&#160;nm&#8208;operating InSb CQD photodetectors with 28% external quantum efficiency and 300&#160;h operating lifetime.








Abstract
Indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors due to their large Bohr exciton radius and tunable bandgap in the 0.6&#8211;1.3&#160;eV range. However, the formation of metal oxides on InSb surfaces during synthesis impedes charge transport, necessitating CQD resurfacing strategies for integration into photodetectors. Previous reports achieved progress in device efficiency by resurfacing these CQDs with acid&#8208;halide sequential treatments, but the device operating stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a solution&#8208;phase strategy for surface reconstruction and passivation of InSb CQDs using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. We find that short&#8208;chain thiol molecules remove surface metal oxides through nucleophilic attack and enable robust passivation of In and Sb via strong covalent bonds, whereas metal sulfides are less effective at oxide removal and passivation. Consequently, the thiolate&#8208;passivated CQDs exhibit a tenfold decrease in trap state density compared to controls and remain structurally and optically stable for 5 months. We demonstrate InSb CQD SWIR photodetectors that realize a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28% at 1450&#160;nm, with the highest operating stability among reported CQD SWIR photodetectors, retaining 95% of performance following 300&#160;h of biased and illuminated operation.

         <title>Bridging Nano to Micron: Architectural Engineering of Supramolecular Bottlebrushes for Extensively Tunable Structures and Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel molecular design enables well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular surfactants in complex emulsion systems, yielding photonic supraballs with homogeneous porous structures. Precise architectural control allows broad structural tuning from the nano to micron scale, extending the photonic bandgap into the mid&#8208;wave infrared. This insight promises wide&#8208;ranging applications in nanotechnology, photonics, sustainable energy, and advanced biomedical technologies.








Abstract
Supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer greater architectural adaptability than covalent BBCPs. However, the dynamic nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions hinders precise control over their chain architecture, resulting in poorly controlled self&#8208;assembly, unpredictable morphologies, and limited utility. Herein, we introduce a novel molecular design for amphiphilic supramolecular BBCPs that overcomes key challenges in the field. The resulting materials exhibit superior thermodynamic stability in weakly polar solvents. This enables the first demonstration of well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular surfactants within a complex emulsion system, leading to the formation of photonic supraballs with homogenous porous structures. Critically, precise chain architectural engineering enables pore diameter tuning over an unprecedented nanometer&#8208;to&#8208;micrometer range (67&#160;nm&#8211;1.92&#160;&#181;m), significantly surpassing the maximum domain sizes achievable with self&#8208;assembled covalent BBCPs. This extends the photonic bandgap into the mid&#8208;wave infrared range, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials with potential applications in thermal management.

         <title>Reverse the Impact of Le Chatelier's Principle in Two&#8208;Electron Air Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) for electrofixation would increase the production cost of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) because of requiring complex pre&#8208;treatment procedures. Atmospheric air is abundant source, but the direct air electrofixation has proved to be very challenging, that in common conception against nitrogen (N2) in the system. According to the Le Chatelier's principle, O2 concentration is diluted by N2 (78%) in atmospheric air which reduces overall reaction rates/equilibrium. Here we report a catalyst system, where the presence of N2 does not impose an adverse effect; rather, it is beneficial for activity. We combine both theoretical and experimental analyses to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, unlocking the critical function of electronic spin, arising from the strong synergy between iron oxide (FeOx) and nickel&#8208;metal organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOF) that optimizes the activation of O2 in air. Consequently, the catalyst for direct air electrofixation has demonstrated an exceptional H2O2 yield rate (262.6 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) and Faradaic efficiency (95.61%), outperforming its high&#8208;purity O2 counterpart (184.32 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and 67.06%). We expect the present finding providing an additional dimension to leverage systems beyond the constraint of traditional rules.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Nonadiabatic Pathways in Small Molecule Activation: Dinuclear Uranium&#8208;Mediated H2 and N2 Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonadiabatic effects have been extensively studied in photoexcited processes, but their role in thermal process so far has neither been thoroughly studied nor appreciated, despite their significance. In this work, H2 and N2 activation mediated by a diuranium complex was studied from a nonadiabatic perspective using multi&#8722;configurational ab initio calculations combined with density functional theory. Stepwise electron transfer during the reaction enhances degeneracy between electronic states, enabling state&#8208;to&#8208;state transitions, i.e., spin downshift. The dual functionality of transition states acting as thermodynamic gateways and channels for nonadiabatic transitions was disclosed. The &#960; and &#963; cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation. Bonding analysis reveals that U5f/6d orbitals mixing with H1s/N2p orbitals afford some degree of covalency to the primarily ionic U&#8208;H/N interactions, with the 6d&#8208;orbitals contributing more pronounced than the 5f&#8208;orbitals in &#963; interactions, while the U&#8208;N &#960; bonding exhibits significant U5f contributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperstable, Minimal&#8208;Length, and Blunt&#8208;Ended Collagen Heterotrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective assembly of the most stable and the shortest non&#8208;covalently assembled collagen heterotrimer to date was achieved. In addition, the first blunt&#8208;ended collagen triple helix and heterotrimers with defined strand overhangs were developed. The exquisite control over the stability and strand arrangement was enabled by frame&#8208;shifting and tailored aminoproline&#8211;aspartate (X&#8211;D) salt bridges.








Abstract
Most natural collagens are heterotrimers&#8212;triple helices formed from three non&#8208;identical peptide strands. The design of synthetic heterotrimeric collagen is challenging since a mixture of three different peptides can form as many as 27 unique triple helices. Here, we present a general method for the assembly of collagen heterotrimers with a wide range of lengths, thermal stabilities, and strand arrangements driven by complementary interstrand salt bridges between (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;aminoproline and aspartate residues. We show how kinetic trapping of undesired trimers can be overcome by adjusting the annealing conditions to obtain the target heterotrimeric helix selectively under thermodynamic control. The design rules and annealing methods allowed the creation of the most stable supramolecular heterotrimer (32 residues, Tm&#160;=&#160;76&#160;&#176;C) and the shortest stable heterotrimer (17&#160;residues, Tm&#160;=&#160;19&#160;&#176;C) to date. Furthermore, frame&#8208;shifting enabled, for the first time, the creation of a collagen triple helix with blunt ends.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regioregular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the double asymmetric core and symmetric/asymmetric terminal engineering are applied to develop multiple&#8208;asymmetric acceptors. By delicately tuning the number and position of peripheral F and Cl atoms, the regioregular triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary OSCs yield the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.32% and ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) among selenium&#8208;substituted acceptors. 








Abstract
Asymmetric molecular engineering is utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), whereas adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge, and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regioregular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25%, and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking and excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179&#160;eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.

3&#8208;Oxabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes were designed as saturated isosteres of meta&#8208;benzene.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although computationally predicted, N2 activation with an in situ generated low&#8208;valent &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) SrI precursor did not result in a stable complex. First dinitrogen fixation with Sr was achieved using a heterobimetallic approach. This highly reducing product vigorously reacts with Teflon.








Abstract
DFT calculations on &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#9472;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(&#956;&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#8722; dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(Me)C&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); DIPePNN&#160;=&#160;DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#8722; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.

Abstract
Catalytic construction of alkyl fluorides through C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations represents a formidable challenge in modern organofluorine chemistry. In this work, we present a decarboxylative monofluoromethylation protocol enabled by synergistic nickel/photoredox dual catalysis for aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives. A structurally diverse array of tertiary, secondary, and primary N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters underwent efficient conversion to their corresponding fluoromethylated products with excellent functional group tolerance (68 examples, up to 91% yield). The methodology's versatility was highlighted through late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylation of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal the involvement of a radical rebound pathway mediated by nickel(III) intermediate, with the homolytic substitution (SH2) process at sterically congested center representing a critical mechanistic distinction from conventional cross&#8208;coupling paradigms.

         <title>Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet as a Key Motif of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Inhibitor Designed via Topological Peptide Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregation requires a peptide&#8208;based approach that accounts for the structural heterogeneity of A&#946;. Here, we employ topological reprogramming via disulfide bonds to stabilize antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets within the dimeric peptide. This strategy overcomes limitations of linear peptides by creating structured complexes that resist aggregation, offering a novel tactic for tackling AD&#8208;related protein aggregation.








Abstract
Peptide inhibitor design targeting self&#8208;assembly of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) represents a promising strategy for suppressing the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional approaches have primarily mimicked repetitive sequences found in fibrillar structures of A&#946; aggregates. However, since the inherent flexibility of A&#946; structures promotes the structural changes in the early&#8208;stage oligomerization, a structural modulation should be considered in the design of peptide inhibitors. Herein, we introduce topological reprogramming of peptides to control the structural transformation in pathogenic A&#946; 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42). The eleven&#8208;residue peptide scaffold Pa11 (14HQKLVNFAEDV24) identified through the initial screening was dimerized via a disulfide bond. The dimerization stabilizes A&#946;42 into higher order structures by promoting antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations, thereby significantly suppressing A&#946;42 aggregation. Our approach underscores that modification in peptide connectivity would be a breakthrough for controlling the intrinsic flexibility of A&#946;, surpassing the limitation in conventional, one&#8208;dimensional peptide building block.

Increasing the molecular weight of the acceptor is an effective strategy to suppress excessive crystallization and molecular diffusion, thereby addressing morphological challenges in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, designing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptors with well&#8208;defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene&#8208;tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243&#160;g mol&#8722;1 and a well&#8208;defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8&#8208;IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8&#8208;BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature (Tg), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high&#8208;performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cu6Sn5 Alloy Electrocatalysts for Formaldehyde Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Bipolar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; alloy was developed as a high&#8208;performance, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst for the anodic formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation (FOD) reaction. When paired with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it enables a formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer, facilitating energy&#8208;efficient bipolar hydrogen production and the generation of value&#8208;added formate.








Abstract
Aldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers an attractive pathway for energy&#8208;saving bipolar hydrogen production with combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of 200% while converting formaldehyde into value&#8208;added formate. Herein we report the design and synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free Cu6Sn5 alloy as a highly effective electrocatalyst for formaldehyde electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating a geometric current density of 915&#160;&#177;&#160;46&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many noble metal electrocatalysts reported previously. The formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer delivers 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 0.124&#160;V, and a current density of 486&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V without any iR compensation and exhibits nearly 200% faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 88&#160;h long&#8208;term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Ortho&#8208;Arylation Reaction of Benzoic Acids with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic ortho&#8208;arylation method has been developed to convert arylthianthrenium salts into carboxylate&#8208;functionalized biaryls, which can be removed in situ or used for further derivatization. This reaction is broadly applicable to (hetero)arenecarboxylic acids, with excellent functional group compatibility and orthogonality to cross&#8208;couplings, enhancing the utility of thianthrenium salts in drug discovery.








Abstract
Arylthianthrenium salts have become key intermediates for late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug&#8208;like molecules. Ruthenium&#8208;phosphine catalysts are now shown to enable their use as aryl sources in high&#8208;yielding ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of benzoic acids. The arylthianthrenium salts are converted chemo&#8208;selectively, leaving aryl halides and boronates untouched. The carboxylate groups are uniquely effective as directing groups, ensuring exclusive ortho&#8208;selectivity even in the presence of competing pyridine or amide groups. This makes the reaction orthogonal to cross&#8208;couplings and conventional C&#9472;H arylations. The carboxylate group can be removed via decarboxylation or serve as an anchor for downstream transformations. Mechanistic studies identify C&#9472;H ruthenation as the rate&#8208;limiting step and highlight the unique efficiency of P(Cy)&#8323; ligands.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Modulated High&#8208;Spin Localized Cobalt Sites Enhance Catalytic Ozonation for Efficient Odor Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;spin localized Co3+ active sites in HE&#8208;Co3O4 modulated by high&#8208;entropy strategy, selectively generate interfacial *O species that dominate the catalytic ozonation process, enabling highly efficient and stable odor control.








Abstract
Catalytic ozonation technology is crucial for environmental remediation due to its exceptional efficiency and capability for complete mineralization of organic pollutants. However, hindered by spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, effective catalytic ozonation remains contingent upon the electronic properties and interfacial interactions of the catalyst. Recent studies identify interfacial atomic metal&#8208;oxygen species (*O) as a key descriptor in catalytic ozonation, determining the derivation of reactive species and subsEquationuent reactivity. Herein, we modulated the high&#8208;spin localized Co active sites in HE&#8208;Co3O4 via a high&#8208;entropy strategy, which selectively stabilizes *O surface species, thereby enhancing catalytic ozonation efficiency. HE&#8208;Co3O4 exhibits a five&#8208;fold higher degradation rate than Co3O4 for 50&#160;ppm CH3SH elimination (63&#8208;fold the mass activity compared to commercial MnO2) while maintaining exceptional stability over 24&#160;h at 298&#160;K. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetization hysteresis (M&#8208;H) measurements confirm the transition of Co3+ to high&#8208;spin states in HE&#8208;Co3O4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that unpaired electrons enhance the hybridization of Co 3d with O 2p orbitals, thereby establishing a *O&#8208;mediated interfacial pathway. This mechanism is directly observed through in situ Raman spectroscopy. These findings provide insights into the targeted modulation of catalyst electronic structures for ozone&#8208;catalyzed environmental remediation.

         <title>Tailoring Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Structures for Enhanced Durability and Efficiency in Zinc&#8211;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a strategy to improve aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) by tuning Zn2+ solvation structures using a hydrogen bond&#8208;accepting cosolvent. This approach stabilizes pH, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility&#8212;offering a pathway to durable, high&#8208;efficiency ZBFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are among the most appealing technologies for large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their scalability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, safety and sustainability. However, their long&#8208;term durability is challenged by issues like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendritic zinc electroplating. Herein, we address these challenges by reshaping the Zn2+ ion solvation structures in zinc bromide (ZnBr2) aqueous electrolytes using a robust hydrogen bond acceptor as a cosolvent additive. Our findings highlight the critical role of interactions within the first and second Zn2+ solvation shells in determining electrochemical performance. By selectively incorporating a low volume percentage of organic additive into the second coordination shell of Zn2+, we achieve effective proton capture, electrolyte pH stabilization during the Zn0 electroplating, and mitigation of ion transport resistance. This approach prevents the formation of a passivation interphase layer on the electrode surface, which typically occurs with higher additive concentrations, leading to increased interphase resistance and cell polarization. This work opens a new avenue in modulating Zn2+ reactivity and stability through precise solvation structure design, enabling efficient and reversible Zn0/2+ plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes with suppressed H2 evolution. These findings pave the way for the development of commercially viable, high&#8208;performance ZBFBs for energy storage applications.

Our findings highlight the critical role of interactions within the first and second Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation shells in determining electrochemical performance. By selectively incorporating a low volume percentage of organic additive into the second coordination shell of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, we achieve effective proton capture, electrolyte pH stabilization during the Zn&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; electroplating, and mitigation of ion transport resistance. This approach prevents the formation of a passivation interphase layer on the electrode surface, which typically occurs with higher additive concentrations, leading to increased interphase resistance and cell polarization. This work opens a new avenue in modulating Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reactivity and stability through precise solvation structure design, enabling efficient and reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;0/2+&lt;/sup&gt; plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes with suppressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. These findings pave the way for the development of commercially viable, high-performance ZBFBs for energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure Origins of Distinct Hydrogenation Activities Observed for Linear and Bent Bimetallic &#956;&#8208;Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first research that employs a combination of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations to clearly elucidate the contribution of electronic structure to the distinct hydrogenation reactivity of bent and linear bimetallic nitrides. 








Abstract
Hydrogenation of metal nitrides is of particular interest due to the direct relevance to Haber&#8211;Bosch ammonia synthesis. Notably, for all bi&#8208; and multi&#8208;nuclear bridging nitrides reported thus far, only those featuring bent M&#9472;N&#9472;M cores can react with dihydrogen (H2) and related H2&#8208;derived species, while the vast majority of linear M&#9472;N&#9472;M congeners cannot. Herein, we present a detailed electronic&#8208;structure study of prototypical bimetallic bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides [Cp*FeIV(&#956;&#8208;SEt)2(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIVCp*][PF6] (1, Cp*&#160;=&#160;&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) and [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;N)CoIIICp*] (3, Ad&#160;=&#160;adamantyl) and linear &#956;&#8208;nitride [(TPP)FeIV(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIV(TPP)][PF6] (2, TPP2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato), as well as &#956;&#8208;imide [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;NH)CoIIICp*][BPh4] (4), using various spectroscopic techniques, in particular, 15N solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, coupled with density functional theory calculations. An in&#8208;depth analysis of their distinct 15N shielding tensors revealed that bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides invariably possess a high&#8208;lying proton&#8208;accepting molecular orbital (MO) and a low&#8208;lying electron&#8208;accepting MO. These electronic&#8208;structure features are key to the bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides affecting hydrogenolysis via either two&#8208;electron oxidation of H2 or H2 heterolysis. However, because of symmetry, linear &#956;&#8208;nitrides lack potent proton&#8208;accepting MOs, which rationalizes their disparate hydrogenation activities.

         <title>Fluorinated Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Robust Wetting Resistance for Durable Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated covalent organic framework (COF) membrane featuring regular vapor transport channels, enhanced hydrophobicity and electrostatic barrier is developed for high&#8208;performance membrane distillation. The prepared membrane enables long&#8208;term brine desalination with exceptional salt rejection (99.80%) and high water flux (195&#160;L&#160;m&#8315;2&#160;h&#8315;&#185;) over 168&#160;h, marking the longest operating duration reported for COF membranes to date.








Abstract
Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising separation technique for producing pure water from brine using low&#8208;grade heat. Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with high porosity and well&#8208;ordered pore structure exhibit excellent flux and salt rejection during MD. However, long&#8208;term MD operation is often restricted by the inevitable gradual wetting of COF membranes, which causes deterioration of salt rejection, primarily resulting from the lack of intrinsic hydrophobicity. Herein, a fluorinated COF (TGTf) membrane with intrinsic hydrophobicity and excellent anti&#8208;wetting property is reported. Under 65 &#176;C and 12&#160;kPa operation pressure, the TGTf membrane maintained a high water flux of 195&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and a salt rejection of 99.80% over 168&#160;h of MD operation, which is the longest operation time ever reported for MD using COF membranes. In addition, the TGTf membrane showed unparalleled resistance to scaling and organic fouling, demonstrating great potential for real&#8208;world brine treatment. Experimental and simulation studies revealed that incorporation of fluorine atom not only enhanced the hydrophobicity of the COF membrane, but also created electrostatic barriers within the fluorinated nanochannels, efficiently preventing ion penetration. These results underscore the remarkable potential of fluorinated COF membranes in MD, offering a promising solution for sustainable brine desalination.

         <title>Bright and Fast&#8208;Response Hybrid X&#8208;Ray Scintillators by Molecular and Dielectric Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a facile strategy for constructing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid scintillators (TPA)2MnBr4, through synergistic dielectric and molecule dual confinement to enhance exciton transport efficiency and radiation recombination processes. It exhibits a low detection limit (18.7 nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1) and high spatial resolution (21.0&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1), making it potentially commercial for real&#8208;time dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging with TFT.








Abstract
Scintillators featuring bright and fast&#8208;response properties are essential for high&#8208;speed and dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging. Nevertheless, simultaneously possessing high light yields and fast&#8208;response remains a significant challenge for most scintillators. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve the bright and fast&#8208;response characteristics of scintillators by leveraging the combined effects of dielectric and molecular confinement in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid scintillators (TPA)2MnBr4. Thereinto, large tetrapropylammonium cations (TPA+) surround [MnBr4]2&#8722; units, forming a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) molecular confinement structure that promotes electron localization and achieves a notable light yield of 56800 photons MeV&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the low dielectric constant of TPA+ can enhance dielectric confinement of [MnBr4]2&#8722; units, mitigating exciton capture by deep defects. These synergistic effects in the scintillators lead to a large exciton binding energy of 1028.8&#160;meV and an ultrafast response time of 500&#160;fs. Notably, under the irradiation of X&#8208;rays, (TPA)2MnBr4 exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 18.7&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 and an exceptional spatial resolution of 21.0 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. Given the bright and fast&#8208;response features of scintillators, we demonstrate the potential applications in 3D dynamic and real&#8208;time X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings lay the groundwork for designing high&#8208;performance scintillators and open avenues for innovative applications in high&#8208;resolution and dynamic imaging.

         <title>Insight into Lysine Selection via Controlled Degradation of 2,4&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Ornithine Polypeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (NB) carbamate&#8208;caged L&#8208;2,4&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (Dab) or L&#8208;ornithine (Orn) self&#8208;assembled into four hierarchical nanostructures. Upon UV irradiation, photocleavage of NB groups led to the liberation of primary amines, which could further undergo lactamizations to generate 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;membered products, providing insights into the natural selection of L&#8208;lysine (Lys) over its homologues.








Abstract
The selection of twenty canonical amino acids in protein synthesis is well&#8208;established, yet the reasons behind their natural selection remain unclear. Specifically, why structurally similar analogs, such as L&#8208;2,4&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (Dab) and L&#8208;ornithine (Orn), are not chosen over L&#8208;lysine (Lys) is unknown. These analogs differ only in alkyl chain length, raising the question of whether such variations influence polypeptide stability and natural selection. To investigate how unnatural amino acids affect the stability of synthesized polypeptides, we present the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (NB) carbamate&#8208;caged photo&#8208;responsive polypeptide amphiphiles based on Dab and Orn via polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized amino acid precursors. Depending on the self&#8208;assembly methods, these poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers formed various nanostructures, including two&#8208;dimensional discs and oblate vesicles. Upon photoirradiation, the newly liberated primary amines underwent spontaneous cyclization with backbone amide linkages to generate thermodynamically stable 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;membered lactams. Such a backbone degradation process eventually led to the disassembly and disintegration of the assemblies. These findings provide new insights into the natural selection of Lys, and open new possibilities for creating functional polypeptide&#8208;based materials in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and other biomedical applications.

         <title>Comparative Study of Solvatomorphs of Stryker's Reagent Using MicroED and Quantum Mechanics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvate form of Stryker's reagent was crystallized from benzene which has regular octahedra with equivalent Cu&#8211;Cu interatomic distances. Quantum crystallography approach HAR led to reliable position of hydrides in both the forms. The reported THF solvate form has edge bridging hydrides while the newly discovered form may have both edge and face bridging hydrides supported by structural and topological analysis. 








Abstract
The atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long&#8208;standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it's increased sensitivity toward hydrogen atoms relative to X&#8208;ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker's reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate. Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge&#8208; and face&#8208;bridging hydrides.

         <title>Taxonomy of Chemical Bondings: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent focus on supramolecular and nanosized systems produced a major increase in the types of observed noncovalent interactions and in the diversity of terms used to designate them. A hierarchical categorization (taxonomy) of terms used to designate electrophile&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interactions is proposed here. Core elements of this classification are some recent IUPAC definitions referring to the electrophile.








Abstract
The concept of the chemical bond is fundamental to chemistry, governing atomic interactions that define all known matter. Despite this central role, the classification and most convenient naming of chemical bonds remain subjects of debate due to the diverse theoretical models and experimental observations. Modelings from quantum mechanical calculations and heuristic principles from experimental observations offer valuable and complementary insights, but sometimes the match and coalescence of these different approaches into a common terminology is not immediate. This paper describes a hierarchical categorization of noncovalent interactions based on the electrophilic atom involved, aligning with IUPAC definitions of hydrogen bonding (HB), halogen bonding (HaB), chalcogen bonding (ChB), and pnictogen bonding (PnB). The resulting taxonomy may avoid some ambiguities that arise from naming interactions based on single chemical/physical features. The proposed categorization that moves from more general and comprehensive terms to more specific and descriptive terms may ensure clarity, comprehensiveness, consistency with periodic trends, and invariancy over evolving understanding of the chemical bonds so that findings can be communicated and stored effectively via both human and machine based protocols.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Alcohols Enabled by Photocatalytic Radical Brook Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of radical Brook rearrangement in asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed, enabling enantioconvergent synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. The reaction proceeded through the combination of photocatalytic generation of masked ketyl radicals and Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides. The the presence of para&#8208;methoxyphenyldimethylsilyl group lowers the oxidation potentials of the racemic alcohol substrates, enabling a radical relay process to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals from initial generation of the aryl cation radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. The formal synthesis of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031 and various down&#8208;stream transformations demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.








Abstract
While radical Brook rearrangement has emerged as a powerful strategy in modern organic synthesis, enantioselective cross coupling involving radical Brook rearrangement remains unexplored. Herein, we report a photocatalytic radical Brook rearrangement followed by cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides, enabling the enantioconvergent construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. Key to this transformation is a radical relay process involving sequential generation of aryl cation radicals, alkoxy radicals, and carbon&#8208;centered radicals through Brook rearrangement. The reaction exhibits exceptional scope (&gt;40 examples), outstanding enantiocontrol (up to 99% ee), and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through formal syntheses of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031, along with diverse downstream derivatizations.

         <title>Precise Construction of Asymmetrically Coordinated PtCuZn Trimetallic Atom Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, PtCuZn/SNC catalysts featuring unique Pt&#8211;Cu&#8211;Zn trimetallic sites were synthesized. The catalyst facilitated electronic interactions and charge redistribution among the three metal atoms, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates and exhibiting excellent performance in acidic oxygen reduction reactions (ORR).








Abstract
With advancements in the study of catalysts at atomic sites, the unique and predictable characteristics of atomic models have enabled the exploration of catalysts with monoatomic, diatomic, and polymetallic centers. In this study, a platinum&#8208;copper&#8208;zinc trimetallic catalyst (named PtCuZn/SNC) was synthesized by the spatial confinement method and polymer coating method. This triatomic catalyst facilitates electronic interaction and charge redistribution among the three metal atoms, optimizing the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates and thereby exhibiting excellent performance in acidic oxygen reduction reactions. In the oxygen reduction reaction test, a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.859&#160;V and an impressive energy density of 532&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 were achieved in fuel cell tests, demonstrating the outstanding catalytic performance of the catalyst. These findings suggest that the design and synthesis of monodisperse triatomic catalysts provide a promising route to improve the efficiency of H2/O2 fuel cells.

         <title>Nucleophilic Germylation of Stable &#960; Bonds via Ge&#9472;Ge Bond Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically controlled nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds was achieved by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology enables unprecedented multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes, affording 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes.








Abstract
Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo&#8208;germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#9472;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo&#8208;germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favored side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo&#8208;convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#9472;Ge) in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.

         <title>A Neutral Single&#8208;Molecule Carrier for Delivery of Phosphonate Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate/phosphonate&#8208;based drugs (PDs), as multi&#8208;negative, hydrophilic molecules, face the greatest difficulty in diffusion across biological membranes, leading to poor bioavailability. Conventional drug delivery strategies to overcome this issue, including utilizing small&#8208;molecule prodrugs or nanoparticle carriers, often suffer from case&#8208;specific modifications or uncertainties in drug loading. Inspired by the anion coordination chemistry of natural phosphate transporters and artificial anion receptors, here we present the first use of a neutral anion receptor, i.e., bis(tripodal hexaurea) cage 1, as a &#8220;single&#8208;molecule carrier&#8221; for the delivery of PDs into living cells. Cage 1 features advantages of molecular&#8208;level encapsulation, enhanced intracellular accumulation, subcellular targeting, responsive drug release, and broad adaptability. It enhances PD accumulation in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing the cellular uptake of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;phosphate/phosphonate substrates by up to 45&#8208;fold via a macropinocytosis&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathway. This work demonstrates the potential of neutral anion receptors to serve as single&#8208;molecule carriers and offers a promising solution for improving PDs bioavailability, advancing the development of antitumor phosphate&#8208;based drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Supramolecular Photosensitizers Derived from Conventional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a versatile supramolecular approach to convert conventional fluorophores&#8212;including cyanines, coumarins, rhodamines, BODIPYs&#8212;into highly efficient heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) via the aggregation&#8208;induced intersystem crossing mechanism. The resulting core&#8208;shell&#8208;structured PSs function as effective photocatalysts while protecting enzymes from deactivation by photogenerated reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) offer advantages such as efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), low dark cytotoxicity, good photostability, and high biocompatibility. Although the development of new PSs through organic synthesis has been a focus of active research, supramolecular chemistry offers a complementary pathway. This study presents a versatile supramolecular strategy to convert conventional fluorophores into heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs using a cyclic peptide&#8208;based scaffold that densely assembles fluorophore moieties. Results demonstrate that supramolecular PSs constructed from four synthetic fluorophore types&#8212;cyanines, coumarins, rhodamines, and BODIPYs&#8212;exhibit a remarkable enhancement in ROS generation efficiency, attributed to the increased intersystem crossing efficiency induced by self&#8208;assembly. Moreover, these supramolecular PSs function as visible&#8208;light photocatalysts, efficiently regenerating NAD+ from NADH. The densely packed polymer shell further shields enzymes from ROS&#8208;induced deactivation, thereby facilitating the development of robust photoenzyme catalytic systems. This study not only enriches the design methodology of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs, but also paves the way for eco&#8208;friendly photobiocatalytic systems.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe Confined into MnO Nanoclusters Enhances Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO)&#8208;induced metal&#8208;atom localization strategy to confine the atomically dispersed Fe into MnO nanoclusters. The trace Fe can trigger a butterfly effect to obtain abundant active Mn(III) with single&#8208;electron eg configuration and strengthened BIEF, resulting in the enhanced alkaline 4e&#8722; ORR activity and durability.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts are promising alternatives to expensive noble metals for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we present a simple metal&#8208;atom localization strategy to confine the atomically dispersed Fe into MnO nanoclusters, which are dispersed and immobilized on high&#8208;conductivity carbon support (MF/CN). The experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the trace Fe(III) ions doped into MnO nanoclusters can induce charge transfer and spin state transition to trigger a butterfly effect, obtaining abundant active Mn(III) with single&#8208;electron eg configuration and strengthened built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), which is greatly helpful to balance the adsorption and desorption of ORR O&#8208;containing intermediates, facilitate the interfacial electron transfer, and improve the electrical conductivity. As a result, the optimized MF0.04/CN exhibits compelling alkaline ORR activity (half&#8208;wave potential 0.79&#160;V vs. RHE) and stability (nearly 100% current retention rate for 30&#160;h). Finally, the MF0.04/CN realizes a remarkable power density (138&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and durability (&gt;666&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This finding not only helps to design high&#8208;performance metal oxide heterointerfaces by tuning eg orbital occupancy and BIEF strength, but also deepens the understanding of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Engineered Spatial Confinement of Cu Single&#8208;Atoms with Diagonal N&#9472;Cu&#9472;N Motifs for High&#8208;Rate CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diagonally undercoordinated N&#9472;Cu&#9472;N motifs with optimized ground&#8208;state interatomic spacing in polymeric carbon nitride significantly enhance cooperative catalysis, achieving exceptional electrochemical CO2 methanation selectivity. 








Abstract
The renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;powered carbon dioxide reduction (eCO2R) to value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks like methane (CH4) holds the sustainable and economically viable carbon cycle at meaningful scales. However, this kinetically challenging eight&#8208;electron multistep deep&#8208;reduction encounters insufficient catalyst design principles to steer complex CO2 reduction pathways. Utilizing atomic copper (Cu) structures with unitary active sites can boost eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity due to the efficient suppression of unwanted C&#9472;C coupling. Herein, we report a sequential ion exchange strategy to fabricate periodic Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts within a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) matrix, where the uniformly dispersed, diagonally coordinated N&#9472;Cu&#9472;N configuration hosts low&#8208;valent Cu&#948;+ centers. Leveraging the periodic N&#8208;anchoring sites with delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the PCN matrix, the isolated Cu sites are obtained with an interatomic distance of &#8764;4.2&#160;&#197; under high metal&#8208;loading conditions. This engineered spatial configuration effectively inhibits C&#9472;C coupling to avoid subsequent multicarbon product formation. The optimized Cu1/PCN demonstrates exceptional eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance, achieving 71.1% CH4 Faradaic efficiency with a high partial current density of 426.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.50&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outpacing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This work delves into effective concepts for steering desirable reaction pathways via precisely modulating active site structures at the atomic level to create favorable microenvironments.

Utilizing atomic copper (Cu) structures with unitary active sites can boost eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity due to the efficient suppression of unwanted C&#9472;C coupling. Herein, we report a sequential ion exchange strategy to fabricate periodic Cu single-atom catalysts within a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) matrix, where the uniformly dispersed, diagonally coordinated N&#9472;Cu&#9472;N configuration hosts low-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; centers. Leveraging the periodic N-anchoring sites with delocalized &#960;-electron conjugation in the PCN matrix, the isolated Cu sites are obtained with an interatomic distance of &#8764;4.2&#160;&#197; under high metal-loading conditions. This engineered spatial configuration effectively inhibits C&#9472;C coupling to avoid subsequent multicarbon product formation. The optimized Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/PCN demonstrates exceptional eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; performance, achieving 71.1% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency with a high partial current density of 426.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.50&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outpacing the state-of-the-art catalysts. This work delves into effective concepts for steering desirable reaction pathways via precisely modulating active site structures at the atomic level to create favorable microenvironments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uniform Half&#8208;Substituted Chiral Arylcycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized the first uniform half&#8208;aryl&#8208;functionalized chiral nanohoop, [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh. It demonstrated strong circularly polarized luminescence with a good luminescence dissymmetry factor and interesting aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior.








Abstract
The strategic implementation of aryl&#8208;functionalization in every phenyl group in organic architectures presents a transformative approach to constructing novel molecular nanocarbon materials. In this present work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a uniform and chiral half&#8208;aryl substituted cycloparaphenylene (CPP), [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirms its hoop&#8208;shaped structure and the existence of planar chirality arising from stereochemically distinct substituent orientations. The resolved pS and pR enantiomers display mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism (CD) signals and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum| = 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2). Photophysical characterization reveals the emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, with pure [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh powder sample exhibiting intense orange fluorescence.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Design, Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the recent developments in basic knowledge, structure design strategies, and applications of 1D COFs, and also provided insights into the challenges and prospects of 1D COFs for the further development of this field.








Abstract
As an important branch of the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) family, one&#8208;dimensional COFs (1D COFs), which are formed by the ordered arrangement of confined covalent bonds in one dimension and non&#8208;covalent interactions (van der Waals force, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and hydrogen bonds) in the vertical two and three dimensions has aroused much attention. Compared with two&#8208;dimensional (2D)/three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs, 1D COFs behaved more easily dispersing and had more opportunities for active sites exposure due to their weaker interchain/interlayer interaction, modified nonlinear edge, and pore structures. These features make them have great application potential in many fields, including catalysis, energy storage, adsorption, sensing, and others. In this minireview, we highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances of 1D COFs in the structure design principles of building blocks, synthesis strategies, and their related applications. Furthermore, we present an in&#8208;depth outlook on the challenges and opportunities faced by 1D COFs, aiming to offer insights for future studies in this intriguing and significant research field.

         <title>Heteroanionic Halogenated TiBTx MBene Protective Layer With Dual&#8208;Functional Zincophilic and Hydrophobic Characteristics for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the halogen&#8208;radius&#8208;isomerization strategy, a dual&#8208;functional TiBTx h&#8208;MBene protective layer with excellent hydrophobic and zincophilic characteristics was constructed on the Zn anode, which can not only block the direct contact between active water and the Zn anode to suppress the side reaction but also promote the deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes, leading to high&#8208;performance AZIBs.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hexagonal transition metal borides (h&#8208;MBenes), emerging members of 2D materials, demonstrate significant potential as protective layers for metal anodes. However, conventional MBenes synthesized by wet etching have massive oxygen&#8208;containing terminations imported during the chemical synthesis process, with zincophobic and hydrophilic, resulting in severe dendrite growth kinetics and compromising electrode performance. In this study, we report a novel hetero&#8208;halogen TiBTX (TX&#160;=&#160;Cl and I) h&#8208;MBenes through a halogen&#8208;radius&#8208;isomerization strategy, enabling precise mixed&#8208;halogen functionalization to create an ultrahigh zincophilic and hydrophobic microenvironment. Compared to single &#8208;I terminations, the mixed&#8208;halogen TiBTX exhibits significantly enhanced zincophilicity with ordered Zn2+ adsorption, attributed to the asymmetry&#8208;inductive effect of the larger&#8208;radius &#8208;I ions. Simultaneously, the &#8208;Cl moieties serve as a protective barrier, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion of the Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes. Notably, the dual&#8208;functional TiBTx&#8208;31 layer (TiBI0.32Cl0.13) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a prolonged cycling life exceeding 2000&#160;h an impressive average coulombic efficiency of 99.86%. Furthermore, the TiBTx&#8208;31@Zn||NVO full pouch cell maintains 95.3% capacity retention over 100 cycles. This work highlights the innovative halogen&#8208;radius&#8208;isomerization approach for interfacial engineering by tailoring halogen terminations, offering new insights for the development of high&#8208;performance h&#8208;MBenes&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Azuperylene: The Nonalternant Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a nonalternating isomer of perylene, azuperylene (AP) is formed by the C&#9472;H/C&#9472;I coupling reactions we developed at the 1,8&#8208;positions of azulene. The aromatic characteristics of the initial azulene are retained, and side chain modifications regulate the stacking pattern. The core of AP has smaller mutual perturbation compared to perylene. AP shows superior semiconductor performance over perylene in field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
The isoelectronic isomer of perylene, hereafter called as azuperylene, has been prepared. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the new isomer can be described as a union of two antiparallel azulenes in which the azulene&#8208;type aromatic character of the starting azulene is partially retained. Four 2,8&#8208;dialkoxy (i.e., ethoxy, n&#8208;butoxy, n&#8208;hexyloxy, and n&#8208;octyloxy) functionalized derivatives of the new isomer core have been prepared. The solid&#8208;state structures of the new compounds have been resolved showing exceptional herringbone &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking ideal for charge transport. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors on sublimated substrates display an excellent hole transport mobility up to 1.03 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 that largely surpasses that of perylene and reveals the great potential for charge transport of this new class of nonbenzenoid compounds.

         <title>Harmonizing Nanoparticle Exsolution from Ce&#8208;Sm Oxide Matrix for Stable Methane Dry Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst deactivation hinders the application of high&#8208;temperature catalysis such as methane dry reforming, where nanoparticle exsolution will likely clear the path. However, the harsh reaction conditions often easily unbalance the exsolution degree, leading to either sintering or insufficient exsolution of metal nanoparticles. Here, we achieve the fabrication of highly dispersed yet exposed Rh nanoparticles exsolved from the Ce&#8208;Sm oxide matrix. Starting from examining the metal&#8208;support interaction of Rh&#8208;CeO2 and Rh&#8208;Sm2O3, the exsolution dynamics of Rh nanoparticles are studied via multiple in&#8208;situ techniques. Rapid exsolution from CeO2 induces Rh sintering and catalytic deactivation, while sluggish exsolution from Sm2O3 results in Rh encapsulation with poor activity. The balanced metal&#8208;support interaction harmonizes the exsolution of Rh nanoparticles from the Ce&#8208;Sm oxide matrix, fabricating an anti&#8208;sintering and coke&#8208;resistant catalyst for methane dry reforming. This work provides insights into the development of catalysts with structural robustness, where the essence lies in the engineering of nanoparticle exsolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Copolymerization of CO, Se and Oxetane: O/Se Exchange Reaction Determining Chain Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of selenium (Se) atoms into polymers has garnered significant interest. However, methods to introduce selenium atoms into polymers remain limited, particularly for approaches that directly utilize elemental selenium. This work presents a novel copolymerization of gaseous carbon monoxide (CO), solid Se powder, and liquid oxetane (OX) to synthesize Se&#8208;containing polymers with tunable structure, using commercially available alkyl borane and organic bases as the binary metal&#8208;free catalyst system. The polymerization process includes two steps: the reduction of CO and Se to form COSe, and alternating copolymerization of COSe with OX. The O/Se exchange reaction (O/Se ER) was discovered during the polymerization, which can alter the polymer structure. The O/Se ER could be significantly suppressed by the binary organocatalyst system at 60&#176;C, affording well&#8208;defined poly(selenocarbonate) in a fast and selective manner. The poly(selenocarbonate) is semi&#8208;crystalline exhibiting a melting temperature of 116&#176;C, a number&#8208;average molecular weight of 39 kDa, a tensile strength of 5.0&#177;0.4 MPa, and an elongation of 5.5&#177;0.5%. Interestingly, the poly(selenocarbonate) could be completely converted into the poly(selenoether) by utilizing the O/Se ER, i.e., decarboxylation in the presence of organic bases at high temperatures. This work provides an efficient synthetic method for synthesizing Se&#8208;containing polymers from readily available monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Change in a Four&#8208;Tetrad DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex upon Intercalation of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand PyDH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures implicated in a number of biological processes. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can alter stability and folding of G4s, which can potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we investigate the interaction of telomeric DNA fragment from Tetrahymena thermophila (TET25, 5&#8242;&#8208;G(TTGGGG)4&#8208;3&#8242;) with a G4 ligand PyDH2 belonging to the bisquinolinium family. When alone, TET25 adopts a mixture of three conformations, with the most abundant being a four&#8208;tetrad hybrid G4. In the presence of PyDH2, surprisingly, TET25 folds into an antiparallel chair G4, with PyDH2 intercalated between G&#8208;tetrads 2 and 3, according to our crystal structure. The structure represents the second example, and the first crystallo&#173;graphic evidence, of ligand intercalation into a G4. In solution, the interaction of PyDH2 and TET25 leads to a number of complexes differing by G4 topology and binding stoichiometry, strong stabilization of G4 (&#8710;Tm = 12.4 &#176;C in the presence of one equiv. of PyDH2) and large hysteresis of &#8764; 10 &#176;C, suggesting that ligand binding and G4 folding processes are complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Material Recycling/Upcycling of Polyamide Waste Enabled by Cosolvent&#8208;Tunable Dissolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamides (PAs, nylons) are a ubiquitous class of high&#8208;performance plastics used extensively in a wide range of applications. Their high resistance to many common solvents and tendency to hydrolyze in strong acids or bases creates a major hurdle to low&#8208;emissions material recycling (i.e., resource separation and recovery). In the present study, the first detailed investigation into the molecular mechanisms of polyamide dissolution, we show that introducing a weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonding cosolvent into formic acid can effectively tune the solvent&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;polymer interactions, drastically accelerates the room&#8208;temperature dissolution kinetics of common (short&#8208;chain) polyamides such as PA6 and PA66, as well as long&#8208;chain and semi&#8208;aromatic varieties. The recovered polymers show no change in their chemical structures or properties, and sufficient selectivity allows for fillers such as short and long fibers, inorganic nanoparticles, metals, and other mixed polymer phases to be recovered at high efficiency (&gt;95%) along with recirculation of all solvents (&gt;98%). This cosolvent&#8208;enabled approach has the potential to make polyamide recycling more sustainable and economical by reducing the energy input and CO2 emissions required to separate and recover the various constituent materials from automotive and electrical components, textiles, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiotemplated Polyketide Chain Fusion and Reductive Cyclization Build the Reactive Butenolide Core of Malleicyprol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Malleicyprol, a virulence factor of notorious animal and human pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group, features a molecular cyclopropanol warhead linked to a reactive butenolide core. Biosynthetic considerations suggested that this heterocycle was formed by the merger of two individual polyketide chains, but the precise mechanism has remained elusive. By combining chemical synthesis, complete in vitro reconstitution of the biotransformation, and mutational analysis, we show that two individually generated polyketide chains are joined by a non&#8208;canonical condensation domain of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid synthetase BurF, which forms an ester bond. By mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and trapping of the aldehyde generated from a substrate surrogate, we found that the terminal reductase domain mediates a reductive chain release with concomitant ring formation. The feasibility of the proposed Knoevenagel&#8208;type intramolecular cyclization into the butenolide moiety was confirmed by a biomimetic synthesis of malleicyprol. The elucidation of the unprecedented thiotemplated butenolide biosynthesis by head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion of two polyketide chains not only expands the synthetic biology toolbox but may also inspire the development of anti&#8208;virulence strategies against BP pathogen infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Induced Solid&#8208;like Condensates Formation of Engineered Peptide in Living Cells for Prostate Cancer Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the rational design and synthesis of Hepsin&#8208;recognized amphiphilic branched peptides (DMN&#8208;SIPL) that can form solid condensates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon enzymatic reaction. The peptide forms solid&#8208;like condensates both in vitro and in living cells, triggered by type&#8208;II membrane&#8208;associated serine peptidase, Hepsin, whose overexpression determines prostate cancer progression. Specifically, integrating self&#8208;assembly, Hepsin hydrolysis, and Hepsin binding domain generates a branched substrate that acts a precursor for enzyme induced LLPS. Upon binding Hepsin on the cell membrane, DMN&#8208;SIPL forms condensates initiated by Hepsin induced self&#8208;assembly. The prostate cancer cells then uptake these condensates via lipid raft&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The entrapped Hepsin in the condensates further hydrolyze the DMN&#8208;SIPL to stabilize the intracellular condensates. Structure activity relationship reveals the importance of enzyme binding motif, enzyme recognized motif, and the self&#8208;assembly motif. Mechanistic studies indicate that the resulting solid&#8208;like condensates modulate cancer cell metabolism by inhibiting Hepsin upstream protein activation and downstream signal transduction, ultimately inducing cancer cell growth inhibition selectively. As a first example, this work investigates enzymatic LLPS condensates formation in living cells, paving the way to generate functional synthetic biomolecular condensates through LLPS for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Integration for Adaptive Interfaces in Flexible Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs), with their remarkable energy density, represent a pivotal advancement in energy storage technology. However, conventional Li&#8208;O2 batteries face significant obstacles. This study introduces polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;based polymer membranes and self&#8208;supporting cathodes fabricated via electrospinning and thermal treatment. By incorporating poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)&#8208;functionalized cathodes through electrostatic adsorption, a polymeric electrolyte&#8208;functional integrated linkage structure was developed. This design facilitates adaptive interface modulation, creating a stable low&#8208;impedance interface between the electrolyte and cathode while enabling efficient ion and electron transport. The resulting solid&#8208;state LOBs (SSLOBs) demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a specific capacity of 8600 mAh g&#8722;1 and a cycling lifespan of 191 cycles. The adaptive interface provides abundant reaction sites, promoting uniform ring&#8208;like discharge product growth and reversible decomposition. Additionally, flexible batteries incorporating this structure exhibit outstanding resilience to bending deformation. These advancements highlight the transformative potential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries, offering promising directions for future energy storage research.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Ultrathin Polymersomes with Reversible Transitions on Acidochromism and Fluorochromism Performances for Multiple Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with reversible stimuli&#8208;chromic and fluorochromic performances offers a prospective yet challenging strategy for achieving high&#8208;level information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, starting from rational synthesis of visible light/pH&#8208;responsive integrated azobenzene monomer, side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers was elaborately crafted using a moderate epoxy&#8208;amino click&#8208;polycondensation. Followed by subsequent solution self&#8208;assembly, dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a diameter of ~253 nm and a vesicular thickness of ~2.1 nm were subtly produced based on the pendant hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism. The photoisomerization of azobenzene units and protonation of tertiary amines within UTPSs were accountable for the visible light&#8208; or pH&#8208;triggered reversible shape and physicochemical transitions (i.e., color, size, diameter, vesicular thickness, zeta potential, fluorescent intensity) as well as repeatable acidochromism from yellow to pink and recyclable fluorochromism, respectively. Benefiting from these attractive traits, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept 2D Quick Response code was meticulously crafted using the stimuli&#8208;chromic UTPSs into patterning lithography, showcasing a multi&#8208;level decryption, favorable reversibility, and preferable recyclability for advanced information security. Our work provides innovative guidelines for the development of dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with multiple stimuli&#8208;chromism merits for the potential of complex information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Blocky Selective Post&#8208;Polymerization C&#8211;H Functionalization of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization of commodity polyolefins affords functional materials derived from a high&#8208;volume, low&#8208;cost resource. However, current post&#8208;polymerization modification strategies result in randomly distributed functionalization along the length of the polymer backbone, which has a negative impact on the crystallinity of the resultant polymers, and thus the thermomechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate an amidyl radical mediated C&#8211;H functionalization of polyolefins to access blocky microstructures, which exhibit a higher crystalline fraction, larger crystallite size, and improved mechanical properties compared to their randomly functionalized analogues. Taking inspiration from the site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization of small molecules, we leverage the steric protection provided by crystallites and target polymer functionalization to amorphous domains in a semicrystalline polyolefin gel. The beneficial outcomes of blocky functionalization are independent of the identity of the pendant functional group that is installed through functionalization. The decoupling of functional group incorporation and crystallinity highlights the promise in accessing non&#8208;random microstructures through selective functionalization to circumvent traditional tradeoffs in post&#8208;polymerization modification, with potential impact in advanced materials and upcycling plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indazole frameworks are pivotal in medicinal chemistry and fluorescent conjugate design. Herein, we reported a photochemical strategy enabling efficient N&#8208;demethylation and aromatic cyclization of N&#8208;methyl amines via UV&#8208;induced nitroso intermediates, offering an environmentally benign route to structurally diverse 2H&#8208;indazole scaffolds. Diverging from conventional methods, this protocol demonstrates exceptional substrate compatibility with various alkyl/aryl amines, facilitating streamlined assembly of functionalized 2H&#8208;indazole modules. The methodology has been successfully applied to synthesize modified drugs and tumour&#8208;specific fluorescent probes targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes. Preliminary evaluations of physiological toxicity and cellular fluorescence imaging highlight their biomedical potential, establishing these strategies as potential tools for pharmacological development and bioimaging research.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Sustainable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries via Molecularly Engineered Polyiodide Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for safe and sustainable energy storage but are hindered by polyiodide shuttling, leading to rapid capacity decay and limited cyclability. In this work, we propose a &#8220;polyiodide reservoirs&#8221; concept, utilizing iodophilic covalent organic cages to confine polyiodide through multiple noncovalent interactions. By precisely engineering the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities around three&#8208;dimensional cavities, these cages evolve from open to near&#8208;enclosed structure, achieving molecular&#8208;level polyiodide entrapment. The optimized superphane cage (18 N&#8208;active sites) enables a ZIB with 90.1% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 C, even under extreme conditions (58.9 wt% iodine content within the cage and an iodine area loading of 3.7 mg cm&#8722;2 in the cathode). Importantly, the cage&#8217;s solubility&#8208;driven regeneration capability retains 85.4% initial capacity over three reuse cycles without stability compromise. This work establishes covalent organic superphanes as a transformative platform for long&#8208;life ZIBs, offering a dual solution to shuttle suppression and electrode sustainability through structural confinement and dynamic recyclability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Coulombic efficiency (CE) is a quantifiable indicator for the reversibility of lithium metal anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the quantitative relationship between CE and electrolyte properties has yet to be established, impeding rational electrolyte design. Herein, an interpretable model for estimating CE based on data&#8208;driven insights of electrolyte properties is proposed. Hydrogenbond acceptor basicity (&#946;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of solvents govern anode interphase chemistry. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &#946; and HOMOLUMO gap. Using the new solvent screened by above regression model, the Li metal anode in the pouch cell with an energy density of 418 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 achieves the highest CE of 99.2%, which is much larger than previous CE ranging from 70&#8211;98.5%. This work provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>Concurrent Production of Glycolic Acid via Anode Valorization of Plastic Paired with Cathode Upcycling of Biomass Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into valuable chemicals, such as glycolic acid (GA), provides a sustainable route for reclaiming the carbon resource in plastic wastes. However, valorization of EG to GA is realized solely via anodic oxidation, which is typically accompanied with the generation of low&#8208;value hydrogen at cathode. Here, we develop a GA production system that combines anodic and cathodic GA production via oxidation of PET&#8208;derived EG paired with reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which is made possible by the discovery of robust PdBi alloy anode and earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode. Building on the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of anti&#8208;CO poisoning on the PdBi anode and temperature&#8208;dependent GA electrosynthesis on the TiO2 cathode, our integrated electrochemical system achieves a total Faradaic efficiency of 182% for GA production. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrochemical coupling strategy paves a way for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of surplus plastic&#8208;/biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks via renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Promiscuity in Cobalt Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction: One&#8208; versus Two&#8208;Electron Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine chelating groups linked by &#8208;NH or &#8208;NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the &#8208;NH group initiates a two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 in case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one&#8208;electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped&#8208;flow conditions, we trapped the one&#8208;electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2&#8208;&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO2RR product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lignin Dissolution and Direct Ultrasmall&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Nanoparticle Formation in Acidic and Alkaline Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Molecular&#8208;Level Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated significant potential in lignin processing, their influence on molecular stacking and conformational evolution during lignin dissolution and nanoparticle formation remains insufficiently understood. Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single&#8208;step approach to produce self&#8208;assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one&#8208;ninth of that produced by conventional solvent&#8208;exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self&#8208;assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass lignin models (4,182 g/mol) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, stacked conformations, solvent&#8208;specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral&#8208;shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H2O solvent system favors offset&#8208;stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Preorganization within Photoactive Pt12L24&#160;Nanospheres for Accelerated Decarboxylation Catalysis at Low Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis with short&#8208;excited state lifetimes or in dilute conditions is challenging because the photochemical mechanism relies on collisions within the excited state of the photocatalyst. In this work, we use substrate preorganization within Pt12L24&#160;nanospheres as strategy to perform photoredox catalysis at low concentrations. We show that Pt12L24&#160;nanospheres are efficient photocatalysts for the decarboxylative oxygenation reaction. Nanospheres endo&#8208;functionalized with guanidinium groups (Pt12LGua24) pre&#8208;organize the substrate, which increases the catalytic turnover frequency by two orders of magnitude. Crucially, this preorganization ensures that Pt&#173;12LGua24&#160;retains its photocatalytic activity at extremely low concentrations (2 &#956;M). This strategy thus overcomes the concentration limitations of photoredox catalysis and may be interesting for applications in dilute environments such as water purification and cellular photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Piezochromic Luminescence in Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Molecular Insertion: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials typically exhibit pressure&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted&#160;and quenched emission due to enhanced intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and molecular planarization. Consequently, achieving blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains a significant&#160;challenge. Here, we report anomalous piezochromic luminescence&#160;in covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) via&#160;molecular insertion. Upon introducing methanol into the nanopores of CTFs, a blue&#8208;shift in emission from 507.0 to 485.5 nm, accompanied by enhanced intensity, is observed under compression up to 1.22&#160;GPa, distinctly contrasting the red&#8208;shifted and quenched emission typically observed in compressed pristine CTFs and other crystalline porous materials (CPMs).&#160;Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal&#160;that methanol can weaken the interlayer &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and intralayer conjugation of CTFs by forming weak interactions with CTFs, such as hydrogen bonding, to realize the interlayer slip and intralayer distortions of CTFs, which results in the blue&#8208;shifted&#160;and enhanced emission. This strategy also proves effective with other molecular insertions, offering a general approach to achieving anomalous piezochromic luminescence in CTFs. Our findings establish molecular insertion as a robust method for engineering pressure&#8208;responsive luminescent materials and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced optical sensors and stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with organometallic reagents remained unsuccessful.

In this process, Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones are obtained with commendable functionality tolerance. A PCET photodecarboxylation enables for the first time SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with b&#8208;H&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, addressing several challenges. This mild and scalable Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond&#8208;forging alkylation applies to the functionalization of natural product&#8208;derived gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with carboxylic acid drugs, fatty acids and steroids.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling to Access Polysubstituted Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between homopropargyl halides and aryl/vinyl electrophiles provided direct access to polysubstituted cyclobutenes. Experimental data and computational studies support a reductive 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization involving an alkenyl nickel(I) intermediate, which undergoes facile SH2 attack to produce the strained cyclobutene ring with overall stereoinversion at the homopropargylic position.








Abstract
The synthesis of cyclobutenes remains inefficient owing to inherent ring strain and poor regioselectivity. We describe herein a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between readily accessible homopropargyl halides and commercially available aryl/vinyl electrophiles for direct access to polysubstituted cyclobutenes. This approach provides the first reductive 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which paves the way for the synthesis of diverse cyclobutene containing compounds (including synthetically challenging macrocycles). The synthesis of an antitumor&#8208;active combretastatin A&#8208;4 analog has been significantly optimized; the original six&#8208;step procedure yielding 14% has been streamlined into a three&#8208;step process with a markedly improved yield of 51%. Experimental data and computational studies support a mechanism involving an alkenyl nickel(I) intermediate, which undergoes facile back&#8208;side SH2 attack to produce the strained cyclobutene ring with overall stereoinversion at the homopropargylic position.

         <title>Crystallization/Precipitation Driven Nonequilibrium Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Thiovalerolactone Toward Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Polythioester with Excellent Barrier Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the precipitation/crystallization driven nonequilibrium ROP of &#948;TVL to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PTVL with capability to recycle back to pristine monomer from a commodity plastic waste mixture. The good thermal and mechanical performances, superior barrier properties, and intrinsic closed&#8208;loop recyclability make PTVL as a promising chemical recyclable packaging material.








Abstract
The development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers with comparable performances with commodity plastics remains as a challenge to establish a circular plastic economy. In this contribution, we propose a precipitation/crystallization driven nonequilibrium ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;thiovalerolactone (&#948;TVL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PTVL in the presence of a strong base/urea binary catalyst. The obtained PTVL exhibits good thermal and mechanical performances as well as superior barrier properties comparable with some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained PTVL can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a high yield and purity by distillation from a commodity plastic waste mixture without tedious separation, highlighting its great potential as a closed&#8208;loop recyclable packaging material.

         <title>Harnessing Porous Coordination Cages for Sonodynamic Therapy: Enhanced Efficacy Through Atomic Precision and Immune Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel series of porous coordination cages specifically designed to enhance the efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Our research tackles the significant limitations of existing sonosensitizers by utilizing the atomic precision and well&#8208;defined structures of these porous coordination cages.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasive approach for immunotherapy. However, its broad applicability is often limited by the inefficiency of sonosensitizers. Here, we introduce a novel series of porous coordination cages (PCCs) specifically engineered to enhance sonodynamic therapeutic performance for the first time. These PCCs incorporate energy harvesting and conversion components, with variations in bandgap, electrical conductivity, and redox activity. Characterized by atomically precise compositions and well&#8208;defined structures, the PCCs enable strategic manipulation of functionalized moieties and metal centers, allowing for precise control over their sonodynamic efficiency. Their small particle size enhances penetration through dense tumor extracellular matrices, significantly improving tumor permeability. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the PCCs exhibit robust sonodynamic effects, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor cells, which triggers apoptosis and antigens release. Notably, PCC&#8208;1 demonstrates metal&#8208;mediated catalytic activity, converting endogenous hydrogen peroxide into additional ROS, synergistically enhancing SDT efficacy and activating the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway in dendritic cells. In tumor model, PCCs effectively inhibited tumor growth and activated immune responses both locally and systemically. Collectively, these findings underscore the exceptional sonodynamic&#8208;immunotherapeutic potential of PCCs, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor treatment.

         <title>Supramolecular TADF Materials from Calix[3]Acridan and Guest&#8208;Linked Polymers for Rapid and Visual Detection of Trace Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the rapid and visual detection of trace benzene was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A based on luminescence color change mechanism, and the limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1. Moreover, GP1@C[3]A was fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane.








Abstract
In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi&#8208;color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest&#8208;linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi&#8208;color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.

         <title>Synergistic Ru Species on Poly(heptazine imide) Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with H2O beyond 800 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst is assembled by precisely anchoring Ru SAs and NPs on PHI via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#9472;N bonds, creating a build&#8208;in electron field (BIEF) that directs charge separation and rushes electron migration to Ru NPs, together with an Ru SA&#8208;induced impurity level to extend optical harvesting. The catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for CO2 reduction with H2O, affording a record&#8208;high AQE beyond 800&#160;nm, while generating the valuable oxidation product H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion with H2O to carbonaceous fuels is a desirable strategy for CO2 management and solar utilization, yet its efficiency remains suboptimal. Herein, efficient and durable CO2 photoreduction is realized over a RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst assembled by anchoring Ru single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) onto poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#8208;N bonds, respectively. This catalyst shows an unsurpassed CO production (32.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1), a record&#8208;high apparent quantum efficiency (0.26%) beyond 800&#160;nm, and the formation of the valuable H2O2. Ru SAs tune PHI's electronic structure to promote in&#8208;plane charge transfer to Ru NPs, forming a built&#8208;in electron field at the interface, which directs electron&#8208;hole separation and rushes excited electron movement from Ru&#8208;PHI to Ru NPs. Simultaneously, Ru SAs introduce an impurity level in PHI to endow long&#8208;wavelength photoabsorption, while Ru NPs strengthen CO2 adsorption/activation and expedite CO desorption. These effects of Ru species together effectively ensure CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The CO2 reduction on the catalyst is revealed to follow the pathway CO2&#8594; *CO2&#8594; *COOH&#8594; *CO&#8594; CO, based on the intermediates identified by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and further supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Boosting Initial Coulombic Efficiency in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;based Cathodes by Tuning Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the potential of Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, highlighting the critical challenges posed by low initial coulombic efficiency and irreversible oxygen release. We introduce a novel treatment method using Glyoxal, which facilitates the integration of transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbital hybridization, aimed at optimizing the electrochemical performance of LRMO. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in ICE, increasing from 85.3% to 102.5%. Additionally, the treated LRMO achieves a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, surpassing untreated samples, and exhibits excellent cycling stability with retention rates of 90.1% after 150 cycles and 76.5% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. 








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen (O) 2p orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn t2g&#8208;O 2p hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co2+/Co3+ redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3% to 102.5%, and a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in determining the temperature&#8208;dependent performance of lithium metal batteries is unveiled. Through SEI chemistry regulation with a wide temperature adaption electrolyte, 5.8 Ah pouch cells achieve energy density of 503.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C with a lifespan of 260 cycles and outstanding energy density of 339&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The performance of lithium metal batteries is significantly affected by temperature variations, which makes it challenging for them to operate across a wide temperature range. Herein, a wide temperature adaption electrolyte is proposed, enabling excellent electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries from &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Large, 5.8 Ah pouch cells employing such an electrolyte achieve high energy density of 503.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C with a lifespan of 260 cycles and outstanding energy density of 339&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The critical role of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in determining the temperature&#8208;dependent performance of lithium metal batteries is unveiled. It is demonstrated that the LiF&#8208;rich, anion&#8208;derived SEI facilitates Li+ diffusion in SEI. Moreover, accelerated Li+ desolvation at SEI is observed. These two aspects promote the kinetics of lithium metal anodes and further inhibit the dendrite growth at low temperatures. This work showcases the importance of understating the chemistry of SEI to enable wide temperature lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A universal P&#8208;type heterointerface for efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted perovskite solar cells with self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal P&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more P&#8208;type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The P&#8208;type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best&#8208;performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000 h under nitrogen&#8208;filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800 h at 55&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000 h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.</dc:description>

As a result, a best-performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000 h under nitrogen-filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800 h at 55&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000 h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Selective Mineralization of Organohalides on Spatially Close Au Single&#8208;Atom and Nanocluster Neighbors over Poly(heptazine imides)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organohalides are commonly found pollutants with long&#8208;term persistence in industrial wastewater and drinkable water. Although these pollutants only constitute a small portion of the total organic carbon (TOC), they contribute major toxicity, posing a threat to ecosystem, biodiversity, and public health. Selective removal of organohalides from wastewater/drinkable water is costly due to the orders of magnitude lower concentration of organohalides as compared to interferences. Herein, spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters composing of approximately 3&#8208;10 Au atoms were grown on highly crystalline potassium&#8208;incorporated poly(heptazine imides). Microscopy and spectroscopy characterizations together with theoretical calculations revealed that under visible&#8208;light illumination, the highly localized photogenerated holes could enable simultaneous generation of &#8226;OH on Au single atoms and selective adsorption of organohalides on Au nanoclusters, which greatly promoted the targeted removal of trace organohalides in water containing high concentrations of interferences. The fixed&#8208;bed photoreactor built using the spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters on poly(heptazine imides) achieved quick degradation of refractory organohalide pollutants in tap water and ground water (2 L h&#8208;1), exhibiting an over 3&#8208;fold log efficiency enhancement compared to traditional advanced oxidation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Imine Reductase Catalyzed Remote Stereocontrol for Enantiodivergent Synthesis of Cyclohexylidene&#8208;Based Axially Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines exhibit unique axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond and have shown great potential in medicinal chemistry. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging due to the long distance between the chirally relevant groups. Here, we report a highly efficient and asymmetric synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines from 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones and primary amines catalyzed by imine&#8208;reductases (IREDs). Enantiodivergent IREDs were identified to provide convenient access to both enantiomers of chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, 99:1 or 1:99 enantiomeric ratio). A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines was also achieved. Moreover, protein X&#8208;ray crystallography and molecular modeling studies were conducted to provide structural insights into the remote stereocontrol of IREDs in forming cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axial chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>A Synergistic Photocatalysis&#8208;Electrocatalysis System for Efficient Hydrogen Generation and Energy&#8208;Saving Benzylamine Oxidative Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting represents a promising tactic for H2 generation, but the light&#8208;shielding effect induced by the generated I3&#8208; greatly impedes subsequent reactions. A critical challenge in this field lies in achieving the timely reduction of I3&#8208; while avoiding the use of additional sacrificial agents, such as H3PO2. Herein, we develop a synergistic photocatalysis&#8208;electrocatalysis system to address this challenge and achieve efficient H2 generation and benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The photocatalytic component features a Re0.5Mo0.5S2 cocatalyst&#8208;modified MAPbI3 with efficient charge separation and ample active sites, achieving a remarkable H2 generation of 875.4 &#181;mol within 4 h through HI splitting. The subsequent electrocatalytic module can operate at a low potential (only 0.44 V to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2) to reduce the generated I3&#8208; and oxidize benzylamine to value&#8208;added chemicals. After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H2 generation. The synergistic system establishes a sustainable catalytic cycle mediated by I&#8208;/I3&#8208; redox couples, enabling continuous photocatalytic H2 generation from HI splitting and energy&#8208;saving electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidative upgrading.</dc:description>

         <title>Impeding Thermal Atomization Enables Synthesizing Fe2N Cluster Liganded Single Fe&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anchoring a ligand, such as a functional group or a cluster, on the active metal center is an effective strategy for regulating the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we present a nitridation&#8208;induced&#8208;clustering strategy to produce not only SAC Fe&#8208;N4 in N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods, but also Fe2N cluster as a ligand anchored on the active Fe site (Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C). Unlike the conventional iron atomization process, the reactive nitridation process can generate thermodynamically stable Fe2N intermediates by nitriding the initially formed iron oxide, thereby impeding subsequent thermal atomization to fabricate Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Compared to the conventional SAC Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C with Fe&#8208;N4 active sites, the Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods are more active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yielding a record high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.957 V vs. RHE in alkali condition. The Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods can be utilized as air&#8208;cathode catalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries with a charge&#8208;discharge gap of only ~0.658 V and outstanding cyclability up to 1000 hours. Theoretical calculations show that the Fe2Nnc ligands indeed modified the electronic structure of Fe&#8208;N4 sites, leading to a lower adsorption energy for the ORR intermediate OH* and facilitating the desorption of OH* and thus higher activity for ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterating Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Semiconductors for Sensitive Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors exhibit significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies owing to their structural tunability and solution&#8208;processability, nevertheless as their bandgap decreases, the non&#8208;radiative recombination for either exciton or photogenerated charge&#8208;carriers increases, limiting short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photoresponse, as governed by energy gap law. Here, a deuteration strategy is employed to universally reduce the non&#8208;radiative decay pathways of SWIR organic semiconductors, enhancing photodetector sensitivity. Compared to protonated L4, the rational deuterated molecule (BT&#8208;12D) maintains SWIR photoresponse to ~1.7 &#956;m and exhibits lower stretching vibrational frequency (2350 cm&#8722;1 vs. 3063 cm&#8722;1), resulting in reduced recombination and 40%&#8208;increase in detectivity (D*) at 1.3 &#956;m for PDPPDTP: BT&#8208;12D&#8208;based organic photodetectors (OPDs). Likewise, deuterated L2&#8208;eC9&#8208;10D&#8208;based OPDs blending with PTB7&#8208;Th exhibit 14% higher D* (1.24&#215;1012 Jones at 1.2 &#181;m) and faster rise/fall time (1.0/1.2 &#956;s) than protonated devices (1.09&#215;1012 Jones; 1.6/1.7 &#956;s). The optimized D* of deuterated OPDs is comparable to and even better than those of commercial detectors at 0.9&#8208;1.2 &#956;m, while the corresponding response time is the fastest value reported for SWIR OPDs. These results highlight the broad applicability of deuteration as an effective strategy to suppress non&#8208;radiative decay pathways in SWIR organic semiconductors, unlocking new opportunities for sensitive SWIR optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Psiguadial A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free and Markovnikov&#8208;type process for divergent hydroboration/multiboration of terminal alkynes has been achieved, enabling the transformation of diverse aryl and alkyl alkynes into valuable but previously inaccessible &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronate, 2,2&#8208;diborylalkane, 1,2,2&#8208;triborylalkane, and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkane with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities by simply modulating the proton additive and solvent.








Abstract
Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high&#8208;value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &#946;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal&#8208;free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates. Derived from it, we have successfully realized unprecedented tailor&#8208;made multiborations (2,2&#8208;dihydroboration, 1,2,2&#8208;triboration, and 1,2&#8208;dihydroboration) of alkynes by simply changing the proton sources and solvents. The broad substrate scope and outstanding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of the developed approaches unlock opportunities to exploit these formerly unattainable organoboronates, thereby expanding uncharted chemical space. The preliminary mechanistic studies highlight the synergistic roles of amide solvents, suitable proton sources, and B2cat2 in facilitating these tunable transformations.

         <title>A Heterodimeric Cluster&#8208;Based Pair Catalyst for Electrochemical Synthesis of Cyclohexanone Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a design strategy for constructing the unique proximity of the two active sites severally from metal cluster and polyoxotitanium cluster, thereby combining the functions of two cluster monomers into one catalyst to achieve highly catalytic activity while simultaneously increasing the target product selectivity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are complex chemical ecosystems, where various functional units execute their individual responsibilities to together complete a catalysis ensemble. Here, we report a dinuclear catalyst originated from two molecular&#8208;purity monomers including an atomically precise Ag4Pd2(SR)8 cluster and a polyoxotitanium Ti4O2(TBC[4])2(iPrO)4 cluster that are eventually paired off by the bridging sulfur. The heterodimeric catalyst with a unique interface consisted of the Ti&#9472;S&#9472;metal (metal&#160;=&#160;Pd and Ag) motifs exhibits selective recognition for nitrogen sources, thereby achieving high performances for the electrochemical synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime. The nitrate is favorably deoxygenated on the metal sites to generate nitrite, followed by the flipping of nitrite at the Ti&#9472;S&#9472;metal interface and the stepwise reduction of nitrite on the Ti site to produce hydroxylamine. Sequentially, a spontaneous coupling from hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone proceeds to construct the C&#9552;N bond for cyclohexanone oxime. Using this combination of distinct functional modules into one catalyst, we develop a strategy for heterogeneous catalysts being designed to increase the substrate conversion while simultaneously increasing the target product selectivity.

         <title>Silylchromium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation of Undirected Allenes by Sila&#8208;Metalation and &#946;&#8208;Silyl Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted allenes without a directing group underwent chromium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselective semihydrogenation with an (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand and a chlorosilane additive. The silylchromium complex formed in situ promotes semihydrogenation through a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of the allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination, with the silyl group acting as a noninnocent ligand to give E&#8208;alkene products selectively. 








Abstract
The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in controlling of selectivity without coordination assistance from directing groups, wherein over&#8208;hydrogenated alkanes and E/Z&#8208;mixed stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron&#8208;rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;phosphine&#8208;ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H2 to the less substituted and electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted C&#9552;C bonds of allenes while enabling the suppression of competitive over&#8208;hydrogenation, proving generally to form trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenes in high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. By this CAAC&#8208;phosphine&#8208;Cr&#8208;catalyzed selective semihydrogenation, unsaturated nitro, nitrile, alkenyl, and hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive bromide, chloride, and fluoride were compatible with various substitution environments. The in situ forming silylchromium as active catalyst by reaction of low&#8208;valent chromium complex with chlorosilane was established by studying the catalytic and stoichiometric reactivity of this species in the semihydrogenation. Deuterium labeling experiments, HRMS, XPS, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility analysis of the related intermediates and theoretical studies support a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination processes with silyl as noninnocent ligand, leading to the E&#8208;alkene products.

         <title>Chiral Diazatriptycene Exhibiting Acid&#8208;Induced Ternary Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching and Crystal Morphology Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) control, including on/off and +/&#8722; switching was achieved by chiral double N&#8208;doping of the triptycene system. Dramatic crystal morphology changes, including a herringbone, trimer cluster, chiral porous tube, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array, were also observed when using an acidic medium, which showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement CPL (AIEE&#8208;CPL).








Abstract
Doubly N&#8208;doped triptycene 2,6&#8208;diazatriptycene 1 was synthesized as the first example of triptycene&#8208;bearing intrinsic chirality in its core. The resolved enantiomers exhibited an acid&#8208;induced ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switching behavior, enabling on/off and +/&#8722; control, with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of approximately 10&#8722;3. Density functional theory calculations indicated that these ternary CPL changes were derived from modulation of through&#8208;space conjugation within the triptycene skeleton. In addition, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 and the salt 1&#8226;(TfOH)n revealed the presence of herringbone arrangements, trimer clusters, chiral porous tubes, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array structures. These results demonstrate that precise change of the molecular assembly can be achieved using N&#8208;doped chiral triptycene facilitated by ionic hydrogen bonding and donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Lipid Nanosonosensitizers with Size Reduction and NO Release: Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer (IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO) has been developed, allowing to reduce nanoparticle size, release nitric oxide and irinotecan, and generate reactive oxygen species for tumor microenvironment remodeling and synergetic sonodynamic&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer under sequential low&#8208;power and high&#8208;power ultrasound irradiation.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains difficult to treat due to its dense extracellular matrix (ECM), immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and deep&#8208;seated anatomy. To address these challenges, we developed IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer that synergizes sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for orthotopic PC. IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO undergoes three key US&#8208;activated responses: 1) size reduction, 2) controlled release of irinotecan (IR) and nitric oxide (NO), and 3) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under low&#8208;dose US, IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO reduces in size (from &#8764;120&#160; to &#8764;40&#160;nm), enhancing tumor penetration, and releases NO to remodel the TME by normalizing vasculature and degrading ECM. This enhances nanosonosensitizers accumulation and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) infiltration. High&#8208;dose US irradiation triggers the generation of cytotoxic ROS, which, in combination with IR&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and enhances antitumor immunity. Additionally, combining IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO with PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) immunotherapy significantly prolongs survival in orthotopic PC models. The cascade strategy&#8212;size reduction, TME remodeling, and multimodal therapy&#8212;effectively overcomes stromal and immunosuppressive barriers, offering a robust platform for treating deep&#8208;seated PC.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Driven Site&#8208;Selective Activation of &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H in Alcohols: A Straightforward Dual&#8208;Catalysis Strategy for Efficient Acceptorless Dehydrogenation</title>

         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;driven selective activation of hydroxyl &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds strategy facilitates efficient photoinduced alcohol dehydrogenation via a bifunctional HAT catalyst. The approach achieves precise control over single or multiple consecutive dehydrogenation events in polyhydroxy compounds and offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities, providing a promising pathway for pharmaceutical synthesis and drug development.








Abstract
The transformation of alcohols into corresponding carbonyl derivatives is of paramount importance for the construction of complex molecules. Current strategies for catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols were predominantly confined to reactive alcohols, such as benzyl or allyl alcohols, due to the relatively high &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bond dissociation energy of the conventional unreactive alcohols. Notably, weak bond catalysis, particularly hydrogen bonding, can selectively activate C&#9472;H bonds by modulating the distribution of electron density. Herein, we have developed a dual&#8208;catalysis platform that enabled highly efficient oxidation of alcohols promoted by a multifunctional catalyst. This strategy achieves selective activation of the hydroxyl &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via hydrogen bonding interactions and polarity matching, which is compatible with both primary and secondary alcohols, demonstrating potential applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. Moreover, DFT studies provide compelling evidence that hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions between 3&#8208;quinuclidinone and alcohols play a pivotal role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Branched Alkyl Chains Tunable Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Manganese Halides for Anti&#8208;counterfeiting, White Light&#8208;emitting Diode and X&#8208;ray Imaging Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
The strategic extension of branched alkyl chain length in double protonated cation systems represents a promising approach for enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and tailoring multi&#8208;functional luminescent materials. These optimized materials demonstrate versatile application potential in temperature&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption, solid&#8208;state&#8208;lighting devices, and X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (Mn&#8208;based OIMHs) scintillators have aroused a research upsurge due to their outstanding photoluminescence performance, low toxicity, and tunable structures. Herein, we demonstrate a molecular engineering strategy that synergistically enhances luminescence efficiency and radiation sensitivity by systematic elongation of branched alkyl chains in phosphonium&#8208;based cations. The (4&#8208;DEATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DEATBP = (4&#8208;(diethylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) crystal exhibits remarkable thermochromic luminescence properties and anti&#8208;thermal quenching effect, highlighting the application potential in high&#8208;temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. Through effective chain elongation, the (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DBATBP = (4&#8208;(dibutylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) single crystal achieves an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100% and exhibits superior performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation, with a high light yield of 67953 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10.45 nGy s&#8722;1. Additionally, the glassy (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 25 lp mm&#8722;1. (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 shows great application potential in the fields of white light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) and express security check due to its outstanding luminescence performance. This work not only offers two kinds of new Mn&#8208;based OIMH materials but also authenticates the role of extending the branched alkyl chain for improving the photoluminescence performance.

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We controlled the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. High&#8208;quality FASnI2Br perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects, which resulted in an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000&#8197;lux.







Abstract
The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.

         <title>Diacylation of Peptides Enables the Construction of Functional Vesicles for Drug&#8208;Carrying Liposomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin&#8208;binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug&#8208;carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non&#8208;amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non&#8208;enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Membrane-forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D-ALPs), which spontaneously self-assemble into micron-sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin-binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug-carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane-forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non-amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non-enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis. However, aqueous head group diacylation is challenging in the absence of enzymes. The use of charged peptides instead of canonical phospholipid head groups offers advantages with respect to ease of acylation and chemical diversity. Here we demonstrate that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables in situ synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D-ALPs), which spontaneously self-assemble into micron-sized vesicles resembling cellular membranes. Diacylation occurs between non-amphiphilic peptides possessing an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal cysteine, and acyl thioesters. Peptide head groups endow unique membrane functions, which is demonstrated by incorporation of an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif, resulting in vesicle targeting to &#945;&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&#946;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; integrin-overexpressing cancer cells.

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;Like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>

The integration of structural biology, genetics, biochemistry, and computational chemistry revealed a specific mechanism by which a CT domain with the &#8220;PW&#215;&#215;&#215;DG&#8221; motif stabilizes an amidate intermediate through a protonated arginine residue R2776 outside the motif to mediate nucleophilic attack. The findings expand knowledge of C domain functions in non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Pt&#8208;doped RuO2 was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for synthesis of GA and H2 fuels from PET wastes. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA and H2 yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1 and 2.38&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, using a membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8722;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8722;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09&#8197;A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.9&#8201;%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Acetaldehyde Production from CO2 and H2O via Synergistic Vacancies and Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of high bonding energy in photocatalytic CO2 conversion and the complexity and false positives in product detection associated with sacrificial agents, sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu are synergistically combined to enhance CO2 activation and lower the activation energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling on Cd0.6Zn0.4S, thereby achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents for CH3CHO production.







Abstract
Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO2 represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd0.6Zn0.4S (CZS) photocatalyst co&#8208;modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8722;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO2 and H+, thereby promoting CO2 conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C2 intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of ca. 80&#8201;% via photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO2 conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.

CH4 and N2 are abundant molecules in our solar system and are the primary constituents of Titan's atmosphere. Under extreme pressures and temperatures within a diamond anvil cell, CH4 and N2 are demonstrated to react to form a range of compounds, dependent on the conditions and initial concentrations. This provides valuable insight into the complexity of the C&#8722;N&#8722;H ternary system under planetary conditions.







Abstract
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are among the most abundant elements in the solar system, and our understanding of their interactions is fundamental to prebiotic chemistry. CH4 and N2 are the simplest archetypical molecules formed by these elements and are both markedly stable under extremes of pressure. Through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments supported by density functional theory calculations, we observe diverse compound formation and reactivity in the CH4&#8208;N2 binary system at high pressure. Above 7&#8197;GPa two concentration&#8208;dependent molecular compounds emerge, (CH4)5N2 and (CH4)7(N2)8, held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Strikingly, further compression at room temperature irreversibly breaks the N2 triple bond, inducing the dissociation of CH4 above 140&#8197;GPa, with the near&#8208;quenched samples revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of strong covalently bonded C&#8722;N&#8722;H networks. High temperatures vastly reduce the required pressure to promote the reactivity between CH4 and N2, with NH3 forming together with longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons at 14&#8197;GPa and 670&#8197;K, further decomposing into powdered diamond when temperatures exceed 1200&#8197;K. These results exemplify how pressure&#8208;driven chemistry can cause unexpected complexity in the most simple molecular precursors.

         <title>Multisite Cross&#8208;Linked Ligand Suppressing Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

A multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid molecules have been proposed to simultaneously passivate non&#8208;radiative defects and stabilize the surface of perovskite QDs, enabling efficient and stable green perovskite QLEDs with a peak EQE of over 25&#8201;% and an operating lifetime of more than 1300&#8197;h, among the highest for perovskite QLEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution&#8208;processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD&#8208;based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross&#8208;linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour&#8208;saturated green CsPbBr3&#8208;based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6&#8201;% together with an operational lifetime of 1340&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin is introduced to simultaneously boost the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Advanced characterization techniques have revealed that coumarin preserves the mechanical properties of the PEO framework, provides new Li+ hopping centers and constructs a Li2O&#8208;rich SEI layer with excellent Li+ transport dynamics, which are crucial for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO's crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Electron Cloud and Space Structure Symmetry Induced Microscopic Split&#8208;phase Interface for High&#8208;rate and Long&#8208;term Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to constrain H2O activity and accelerate Zn2+ migration, which remarkably solves the interfacial side reactions and uneven Zn deposition caused by unstable EDL, especially under fast mass&#8208;charge transfer at high&#8208;rate conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes and Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with excellent endurance.







Abstract
Weak dipole interactions between highly symmetric H2O molecules and SO42&#8722; species are the root cause of unstable electric double layer (EDL), which triggers the hydrogen evolution reaction and Zn dendrite formation, significantly impeding the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we designed a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface (MSPI) by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to suppress interfacial side reactions and achieve uniform Zn deposition. The structurally asymmetric methylurea (MU) molecules possess both hydrophobic methyl and hydrophilic amino groups, which disrupt the continuity of H&#8208;bonding network and the aggregation state of H2O molecules, resulting in peculiar nanoscale core&#8211;shell&#8208;like clusters. Such a unique structure further evolves into MSPI at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, ensuring a continuously stable EDL. The DRT analysis and MD simulation confirmed that MSPI structure is composed of the outer H2O layer and the inner MU layer, which greatly suppress the activity of H2O molecules and accelerate Zn2+ migration. Consequently, the formulated electrolyte exhibited remarkable cycle reversibility over 1500&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, achieving a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity of 30&#8197;Ah&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, its feasibility was demonstrated by coupling with the I2@AC cathode, achieving an impressive 28,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Coordination Topology Design in Anion&#8208;Rich Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolyte, the equal molar dual&#8208;anion strategy expands the solvation energy level distribution and boosts the Li&#8208;ion transport. Moreover, a universal principle is found based on the coordination topology of the dual&#8208;anion combination: only the combination containing anion with the multi&#8208;coordination site can raise the Li&#8208;ion transport in such systems, supporting the design of high&#8208;rate lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;rich solvated structures are promising for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their good interfacial compatibility. Nevertheless, limited Li&#8208;ion transport of these electrolytes has hindered their high&#8208;rate application. Here we demonstrate that Li&#8208;ion transport in anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolytes could be facilitated by designing the coordination topology of anions in the solvation structure. Results show that, for a binary&#8208;anion electrolyte, equal&#8208;molar anions show the most expanded energy level distribution of solvation structures, thus reducing the Li&#8208;ion transport energy barrier, and resulting in a Li&#8208;ion conductivity even higher than that of the commercial carbonate electrolyte at a temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. More importantly, we identify a universal principle governing the Li&#8208;ion transport enhancement driven by anion configurations: only the combination of anions with multi&#8208;coordination sites shows facilitation in Li&#8208;ion transport, while the combination of centrosymmetric anions with the mono&#8208;coordination site harms it. The diversified anion&#8208;rich solvated structures also form stable interphases on the electrodes, enabling long&#8208;term cycling of 4.5&#8197;V LMBs at a high current density of 3.78&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Overall, our findings shine new light on developing practical electrolytes for energy&#8208;dense LMBs.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Induced Electrochemical Ion&#8208;Solvent Cointercalation in Pillared Titanate Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;expansion of hydrogen tetratitanate is realized with organic pillars. Optimized atomistic configurations of the pillared materials are proposed by characterization with experiment and simulation. The nanoconfinement modification of HTO induces ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions with improved kinetics and increased storage capacity.







Abstract
Electrochemical ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions are an avenue to reach improved kinetics compared to the corresponding intercalation of desolvated ions. Here, we demonstrate the impact of different structural pillar molecules on the electrochemical Li+ intercalation mechanism in expanded hydrogen titanate (HTO) electrode materials. We show that interlayer&#8208;expansion of HTO with organic pillars can enable cointercalation reactions. Their electrochemical reversibility is drastically improved when non&#8208;cross&#8208;linking pillars are employed that expand and separate the host material's individual layers, underlining the impact of the electrochemo&#8208;mechanics of the nanoconfined interlayer space. This pillared HTO structure results in an increased Li+ storage capacity and reversibility compared to pristine HTO. We derive structural models of the pillared HTO host materials based on combined experiments and theoretical calculations, and employ electrochemical operando experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the nanoconfinement&#8208;induced cointercalation mechanism in pillared HTO electrode materials. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoconfined pillar molecules to modify host materials and enable highly reversible cointercalation reactions with improved capacity and kinetics.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polar&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silane protection strategy is developed to enable early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed efficient terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene and polar monomers. A series of polar functionalized polyolefin elastomers with high molecular weight and high 1&#8208;octene incorporation are successfully synthesized. This strategy shows comprehensive better performances than previously wide practiced aluminum protection strategy, leading to products with excellent mechanical and elastic properties, along with great practical applications.







Abstract
Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) are widely used for many applications including plastic toughening and encapsulating photovoltaic modules. The introduction of polar groups into POEs improves their compatibility and adhesion with polar components, but it is challenging to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polar&#8208;functionalized POEs (P&#8208;POEs) via copolymerization. Here, we report a silane protection strategy to enable the production of P&#8208;POEs (including an ethylene&#8208;based P&#8208;EPOE and a propylene&#8208;based P&#8208;PPOE) with widely tunable 1&#8208;octene incorporation ratios (7.4&#8211;19.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), appropriate polar monomer incorporation ratios (0.7&#8211;2.7 mol&#8201;%), melting points (63.8&#8211;99.8&#8201;&#176;C), and high molecular weights (up to 43.8&#215;104&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This approach involved the early transition metal&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum&#8208;based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P&#8208;POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high&#8208;performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.

The La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge was constructed and activated in the three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous La2O3&#8208;NiO, which acted as a kind of superior anode catalyst in urea electrooxidation and purification. 3DOM morphology increased the contact surface of the material with the solution and accelerates mass transfer.

Abstract
Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La&#8208;induced three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49&#8197;V @ 80&#8201;&#176;C) and 280&#8197;h stability test at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density (25&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV&#8208;vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&#948;+ (&#948;&#8805;3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR&#8208;IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.

         <title>An Adhesive Adaptation Layer Mitigates the Interfacial Instabilities of Rigid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

Hierarchical solid polymer electrolytes (H&#8208;SPEs) featuring an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) effectively mitigate interfacial instabilities in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries by reinforcing electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and promoting uniform lithium deposition. This novel architecture demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity retention over 960&#8197;cycles with high&#8208;loading NMC622 cathode.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely recognized as promising candidates for enabling solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with improved safety, high energy density, and extended cycling life. The traditional perspective posits that increasing the mechanical modulus of SPEs enhances their capacity to regulate Li0 deposition and suppress dendrite penetration. However, this study reveals a distinct failure mechanism: a rigid SPE with a high storage modulus suffers from delamination&#8208;induced cell failure due to its inability to accommodate the volumetric changes of the Li0 anode. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical SPE incorporating an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) positioned between the Li0 anode and the rigid SPE. The AAL combines strong adhesive strength, effectively mitigating delamination, with flowability, allowing it to eliminate interfacial voids and defects. Structural characterization via Cryo&#8208;TEM and SEM demonstrates that this hierarchical design facilitates uniform, dense, and whisker&#8208;free Li0 deposition, in sharp contrast to the uneven and porous morphology observed with the rigid SPE alone. Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial stability promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;enriched SEI layer, contributing to long&#8208;term cycling stability. As a result, the H&#8208;SPE exhibits superior electrochemical performance, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity over 960 cycles when paired with high&#8208;loading (1.6&#8197;mAh/cm2) NMC622 cathode.

         <title>Enabling Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation Prior to Water Reduction in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Mild Protic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and introduces mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) for aqueous zinc batteries according to thermodynamics. MMI is reduced prior to water, forming an organic&#8208;dominated SEI that effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition. Hence, zinc anodes exhibited exceptional reversibility and cycle stability in electrolyte with 20&#8197;mM MMI.







Abstract
Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)2. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI&#8208;derived SEI exhibits a superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 13.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.

         <title>Preparation of Peapod&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Periodic Sequence via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Morphology Differentiation and Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel strategy for constructing peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence through fusion of vesicles and porous spheres. The generation and assembly of vesicles and porous spheres are achieved via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in one&#8208;pot. The aggregation unit numbers of peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers are affected by the length of solvophobic block and collision probability of vesicles and porous spheres.







Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles have so far dominated the field of nanoparticle assembly, and assembly of pure organic nanoparticles (such as block copolymer nanoparticles) has rarely been examined in colloidal systems. Expanding the scope of nanoparticles is of great significance for the study of nanoparticle assembly. Herein, a paradigm for the copolymerization of organic nanoparticles into peapod&#8208;like linear nanostructures with periodic sequence is introduced. Vesicles and porous spheres are generated in situ during polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and can be viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;). The subsequent copolymerization of these nanomers is completed in one&#8208;pot, which greatly simplifies the preparation of nanomers and peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers. It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on&#8208;demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano&#8208;object.

         <title>Chemocatalytic Cell Tagging Platform for Recording Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions via Engineered Palladium&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative chemocatalytic proximity labeling platform&#8208;Artificial Metalloenzyme Tagging Technology (ArM&#8208;Tag). The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a protein scaffold to catalyze a bioorthogonal O&#8208;deallylation reaction directly on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range.







Abstract
Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8722;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.

This study explores the catalytic role of water molecule and the inherent thermal radiation in gaseous homogeneous high&#8208;temperatue propane dehydrogenation, in which the water molecule could generate hydroxyl radicals with the help of thermal radiation and thus facilitate the reaction. Consequently, the proposed system could achieve a 37.93&#8201;% olefin yield and a 51.14&#8201;% single&#8208;pass propane conversion, and an excellent stability for over 2,000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8901; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93&#8201;%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14&#8201;%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven CuAAC Reaction Catalyzed by Photosensitive Biohybrids Energized by Lactate for Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system has been presented for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Powered by lactate, the biohybrid can trigger the CuAAC reaction to generate active drugs in situ through bacterial respiration. Of note, under illumination, the CuAAC reaction can be further accelerated.







Abstract
As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiS&#8208;induced free&#8208;electron reversal migration discharges dz2&#8208;orbital electrons of Au cocatalysts to reduce the antibonding occupancy of Au&#948;+&#8208;Oad bonds, thus improving O2 adsorption and stabilizing *OOH intermediates on NiS@Au cocatalysts to achieve highly selective H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82&#8197;&#956;mol/h/50&#8197;mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07&#8201;% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Evolution&#8208;Guided Discovery of Antimycobacterial Triculamin&#8208;Like Lasso Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hypothesized convergent biosynthesis of triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from different biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) types represented across multiple bacterial phyla. The elucidation of the triculamin non&#8208;canonical BGC and resistance mechanism by heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus and in&#8197;vitro acetylation with resistance conveying enzyme. Discovery and characterization of two triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from canonical lasso peptide BGCs.







Abstract
Triculamin is a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) lasso peptide with potent antimycobacterial activity, produced by an unusual, non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and N&#8208;acetyltransferase (triT). Through in&#8197;vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin&#8208;like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non&#8208;canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin&#8208;like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin&#8208;like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross&#8208;phylum distribution.

Abstract
Following on our report of the first coordination complex between a noble&#8208;gas compound and a crown ether, (CH2CH2O)5XeO3, the reactions and structures of XeO3 complexes with 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 were investigated. The reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with XeO3 in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, whereas reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with moist solid XeO3 in acetone solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O complexes are air&#8208;stable and shock&#8208;insensitive, whereas [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF is a treacherous, shock&#8208;sensitive detonator. Low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that XeO3 is coordinated to the crown ether and H2O through short Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts. Mappings of the XeO3 Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO3 that are consistent with &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The calculated gas&#8208;phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;

         <title>Highly Strained Electron&#8208;Rich Molecular Bowl and Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowls is essential due to their potential complementary properties to molecules such as corannulene and sumanene. However, their development is challenging because of the inherent high strain. Herein, the small electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1 (C20N2H8) and the wavy dimer 2 have been synthesized, and their optical, electronic, and supramolecular properties are extensively studied.







Abstract
Introducing two pyrrole rings at the armchair edges of perylene creates the small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1, which can be viewed as a nitrogen&#8208;doped end&#8208;cap of C70. Despite numerous attempts since 2008, its synthesis has been hindered by strain and synthetic challenges. In this study, we present the synthesis and property analysis of molecular bowl 1 and its dimer, the wavy&#8208;shaped nanographene 2. Substituents on nitrogen atoms significantly affect the bowl depth, intermolecular interactions, and supramolecular behaviors. Consequently, the butyl&#8208;substituted molecular bowl 1&#8201;a forms unusual polar crystals with all bowls oriented similarly, suggesting potential pyroelectric or ferroelectric applications. Due to the electron&#8208;rich nature, compounds 1 exhibit significantly strong binding affinity towards fullerene, with 1&#8201;a forming a sandwich structure with C70. Furthermore, neutral bowls 1 display counter&#8208;rotating ring currents similar to corannulene, while their dications exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The wavy&#8208;structured nanographene 2 demonstrates two continuously reversible oxidation processes, and its dication 22+ shows remarkably high stability under ambient conditions. In summary, this work constructs a small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl and its nanographene dimer, highlighting their exceptional properties, promising applications, and potential as foundations for future advanced nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Constructing Dense Morphology of Sn with High Reversibility under High Areal&#8208;capacity for Anode&#8208;Free Tin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiourea (TU) was proposed as an effective additive to constructing dense morphology of deposited Sn in acidic methylsulfonate&#8208;based electrolyte. By participating in double electrode layer, TU reduces exchange current density of Sn2+/Sn redox, suppresses rampant two&#8208;dimension, and makes Sn anode exert high coulombic efficiency of 99.85% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free Sn battery was developed.







Abstract
Sn electrode possesses high reversibility, redox kinetics and corrosion resistance, as well as non&#8208;toxic and environmental compatibility, which is competitive candidate for aqueous batteries. However, due to huge size of deposition particles and &#8220;dead Sn&#8221;, it is a great challenge to obtain high areal&#8208;capacity (&gt;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible Sn redox electrochemistry with high areal&#8208;capacity enabled by thiourea additive. Systematical investigations reveal the participation of thiourea molecules in the electrical double layer, reducing exchange current density and suppressing rampant two&#8208;dimensional diffusion. As a result, flat and dense scale&#8208;like deposition Sn morphology is obtained, which enables high cycle stability with high areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for symmetrical cell with lean electrolyte (25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and delivering a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;% with practical high 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 area&#8208;capacity for asymmetrical cell. More importantly, anode&#8208;free Organic||Sn battery is developed, and 62&#8201;% capacity retention can be obtained after 570 cycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Triple&#8208;Atom Sites Combined with Oxygen Vacancy for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Propionic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a defect engineering strategy to create asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs), which achieves high propionic acid synthesis rates and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the key roles of OVs and triple&#8208;atom sites. Such OVs&#8208;engineered asymmetric catalytic sites efficiently promote the multistep C&#8722;C coupling process.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon products is an emerging approach for achieving carbon neutrality; however, the design of active sites that effectively promote multistep C&#8722;C coupling remains a challenge. Here, we propose a straightforward defect engineering approach to construct asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (named CWO&#8208;OVs). The optimized CWO&#8208;OVs achieve a photochemical synthesis rate of propionic acid (C3H6O2, PA) of 86.46&#177;2.92&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with an electron&#8208;based selectivity of 89.27&#8201;%, which exhibits a remarkable advantage in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations corroborate the prominent role of OVs in inducing the triple&#8208;atom sites: (1) the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+ triggers the first step of C1&#8208;C1 coupling to form *CH2CH3; (2) Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+ facilitates subsequent C2&#8208;C1 bonding, ultimately leading to PA production. This charge&#8208;asymmetric cascade reaction system offers new insights into the design of efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Anion Adsorption at the Inner&#8208;Helmholtz Plane Directs Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of anion adsorption at the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane in directing CEI formation was investigated using multiple in situ/operando techniques. QCM&#8722;D directly observes its influence on interfacial structure, while in situ spectroscopy and EQCM&#8722;D confirm its impact on CEI chemistry. The anion&#8208;driven interphase leads to a more inorganic&#8208;rich CEI, suppressing electrolyte decomposition and enhancing LiCoO2 cycling stability at high voltages.







Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (CEI) on cathode surface constitutes the foundation of realizing high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet its formation, a highly heterogeneous process involving irreversible reactions between electrolyte components and cathode materials, remains poorly understood. Herein, combining multiple in situ/operando interfacial characterization techniques, we establish the correlation between interfacial structure and interphasial chemistry, and reveal the key role played by adsorptive behavior of various electrolyte components in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane during CEI formation. Quartz crystal microbalance equipped with dissipation modification detects that difluorooxalatoborate (DFOB&#8722;) anion preferentially adsorbed on LiCoO2 tends to expel carbonate solvents from the adsorption layer, thus suppressing their electrochemical decomposition at high voltages and leading to a more compact CEI derived from anions with limited contribution from organic ingredients. Consequently, the CoO2 lattice structure protected by the dense CEI remains intact despite near&#8208;complete delithiation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability for 4.7&#8197;V operation of LiCoO2 cathode. The atomistic&#8208;level insight into the key factors that govern CEI formation provides directive knowledge that accelerates electrolyte design for high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Nanourchin&#8208;like Uricase&#8208;Poly(L&#8208;proline) Conjugate with Retained Enzymatic Activity, Mitigated Immunogenicity, and Sustained Efficacy Upon Repeated Administrations</title>

Poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugated uricase was facilely produced via a grafting&#8208;from approach, which showed mitigated immunogenicity and preserved activity in vivo after repeated injections.







Abstract
The poor half&#8208;life and strong immunogenicity of proteins such as uricase (UOx), a therapeutic enzyme for chronic refractory gout and hyperuricemia, are pressing clinical challenges. Although conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGylation) of UOx can improve the pharmacokinetics, preexisting or induced anti&#8208;PEG antibodies, which lead to accelerate blood clearance (ABC) and reduced response rate, have been a major clinical hurdle. Herein, we report the facile &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; preparation of a nanourchin&#8208;like uricase&#8208;poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugate, namely UOx&#8208;PLP, with high grafting&#8208;density, enhanced thermal, lyophilization, freeze&#8208;thaw, and proteolytic stability. Through a transient preblocking strategy in the synthesis, the UOx&#8208;PLP overcomes activity loss and retains ~82&#8201;% enzyme activity. In Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats, UOx&#8208;PLP stimulates minimum complement activation and anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Unlike PEG&#8208;UOx gave a significantly reduced half&#8208;life after repetitive administrations, UOx&#8208;PLP shows no sign of ABC effect. Moreover, the half&#8208;life of UOx&#8208;PLP remain almost unchanged when cross&#8208;administrated to rats previously received PEG&#8208;UOx and with high titers of anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Finally, UOx&#8208;PLP shows minimum loss of efficacy after five straight administrations in a UOx knock&#8208;out hyperuricemia mice model, whereas PEG&#8208;UOx experiences sharp loss of efficacy upon the same treatment. Overall, the simple preparation and outstanding nonclinical results highlight the enormous potential of UOx&#8208;PLP for future clinical translation.

         <title>Nanofabrication via SEM Electron&#8208;Beam Stimulated Suzuki&#8211;Miyura Type Reaction: Fingerprints of Carbazole Derivative Revealed by Synchrotron&#8208;IR Nanospectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>

This study investigates the conditions under which 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole can be formed in solid state by using a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction triggered by electron beam irradiation. Synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and mass spectrometry revealed signatures of the target product, suggesting a potential palladium&#8208;free reaction pathway and offering a direct route to the fabrication of nanodevices.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based compounds have demonstrated interesting physical and chemical properties for OLED devices. 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole has a direct application in the composition of structures with potential to suppress the loss of efficiency under high luminance conditions along with its use in the emitting layer. In this study, we reveal and explore the conditions in which a triggered electron beams (e&#8208;beams) solid state Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction between 3,6&#8208;diiodocarbazole and phenylboronic acid could be carried out. Applying typical SEM acceleration voltage (30&#8197;keV), sufficient energy transfer enabled the activation of the reaction. Synchrotron Infrared Nano Spectroscopy (SINS) was used to acquire nanoscale molecular vibrational spectra and compare with conventional FTIR absorption spectra for chemical characterization. Evidences obtained by mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole under higher e&#8208;beam dose (30&#8197;keV, 10&#8197;minutes), when compared to 5 and 10&#8197;keV. In addition, the phenylboronic acid seems to have a role in the reaction outcome. Both samples irradiated in the presence and in the absence of palladium exhibited the fingerprints of the expected product 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole shedding light on possible alternative mechanisms and the straightforward construction of nanodevices.

         <title>Crystallization Modulation and Comprehensive Defect Passivation by Carbonyl Functionalized Spacer Cation Towards High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy was proposed of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. By this synergetic strategy, improved crystallization, reduced defect density, released residual stress and minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses were accomplished simultaneously. The inverted devices delivered a champion PCE of 25.77&#8201;%.







Abstract
The inverted cesium/formamidinium (CsFA)&#8208;based methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells possess great potential in simultaneously realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent stability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization process and poor film quality hinder further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, we propose a synergistic modulation strategy of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. L&#8208;Alanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (L&#8208;ABEHCl) containing carbonyl functionalized ammonium cation is incorporated into perovskite precursor solution, increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the crystal growth rate because of its strong interaction with precursor components, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. No 2D perovskite is formed for L&#8208;ABEHCl as additive whereas 2D perovskite is formed upon L&#8208;ABEHCl post&#8208;treatment. It is revealed that FA+ and Cs+ in precursor solution suppress the formation of 2D perovskite. As a result, the L&#8208;ABEHCl passivates the defects at GBs in the form of organic salts and passivates interface defects in the form of 2D perovskite. Due to minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses, the inverted devices using synergistic modulation strategy achieve a maximum PCE of 25.77&#8201;% (certified stabilized PCE of 25.59&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation method. The unencapsulated target device maintains 90.85&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 2300&#8197;h of continuous maximum power point tracking, among the most excellent stabilities accomplished by inverted devices.

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8211;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), distinguished by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently introduced as an adaptable electron&#8208;withdrawing motif to construct interlayer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The unique conformational and electronic structure of BSI imparts excellent thickness tolerance and universal applicability to the interlayer materials, leading to 19.80&#8201;% efficiency OSCs with good operational stability.







Abstract
Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08&#8201;% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84&#8201;% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100&#8197;hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94&#8201;% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90&#8197;nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80&#8201;% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical&#8208;Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing PyGO conductive heterochannel with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity were fabricated through super&#8208;assembly strategy for smart ion transport. Benefiting from the coupling conductivity and photosensitivity of the PPy conductive network, the output power density of salinity gradient energy device with this lamellar photoelectric membrane could achieve 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under illumination.







Abstract
Artificial nanofluidic devices inspired bylight&#8208;driven ion transport in biological systems, leveraging the photoelectric effect, have attracted extensive attention for their potential in signal transduction and smart ion transport applications. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p&#8208;n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify graphene oxide (GO), creating polypyrrole&#8208;graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel&#8208;sized gradients and inherent optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super&#8208;assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl, which is 35.6&#8201;% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real&#8208;time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture. This work presents a novel and effective strategy for light&#8208;driven ion transport with potential applications in energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) disrupt the hydrogen bond network through the surface amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands, activate the interfacial water, and enrich the alkyne molecules. In addition, their unique enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets adsorb alkyne molecules through the &#963;&#8208;bonding mode, allowing the timely desorption of alkene, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% selectivity, and 85&#8201;% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work not only exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.

         <title>Twist and Shine: Ultra&#8208;Narrow Red Emission from Nitrogen and Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen are synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy. These molecules feature a bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene core, with benzopyran rings fused at the periphery to enhance the rigidity of &#960;&#8208;framework. This unique design enables ultra&#8208;narrow red emission, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Nanographenes, known for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have garnered significant interest for their tunable electronic structures, particularly through heteroatom doping. Herein, we report the synthesis of two twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes (h&#8208;NGs) co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen via a three&#8208;step strategy, where the tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization and ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution serve as a key step. Both h&#8208;NGs incorporate a unique bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene (BFDAC) core, with one further extending the &#960;&#8208;system via peri&#8208;fusion of four benzopyran units. Single&#8208;crystal analyses reveal that BFDAC core of both h&#8208;NGs adopts a highly twisted geometry, whereas the benzopyran&#8208;fused one has enhanced rigidity. Theoretical studies confirm a global aromaticity with 30 &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized along BFDAC periphery. Notably, co&#8208;doping enables precise electronic tuning, with pyridinic nitrogen lowering the LUMO level and benzopyran oxygen raising the HOMO level. Both h&#8208;NGs display the red photoluminescence (PL), and the benzopyran&#8208;fused derivative exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm, among the narrowest reported for organic red&#8208;emitting materials. Both h&#8208;NGs exhibit acid&#8208;responsive optical behavior including near&#8208;infrared absorption shift and PL quenching, providing additional functional versatility.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Uric Acid Oxidation via Interdistance&#8208;Dependent Switching Pathways in Correlated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Boosting Sensing Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlated ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Ru c&#8208;SACs) with tailored single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) of 9.3&#8197;&#197;, 7.0&#8197;&#197;, and 6.2&#8197;&#197; were prepared via organometallic design. The Ru c&#8208;SAC with 6.2&#8197;&#197; SAD exhibited superior uric acid electrooxidation activity due to the optimal inter&#8208;atomic distance facilitating a three&#8208;electron transfer pathway, substantiated by comprehensive experimental studies and theoretical computations, and unveiling atomic&#8208;level SAD&#8208;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The overly simplistic geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a significant bottleneck in the field of single&#8208;atom sensing, impeding both the design of highly efficient electrochemical sensors and the establishment of structure&#8211;activity relationships. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy to boost the sensing performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by precisely tuning the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs). A series of Ru&#8208;based c&#8208;SACs (Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197;, Rud=7.0&#8201;&#197;, and Rud=9.3&#8201;&#197;) are synthesized with predetermined SAD values, which are comprehensively characterized by various techniques. Electrochemical studies on uric acid (UA) oxidation reveal that Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197; demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity of 9.83&#8197;&#956;A &#956;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;2, which is superior to most of electrochemistry biosensors reported previously. Kinetic analysis and product examination unveil that the 6.2&#8197;&#197; Ru SAD instigates a distinctive three&#8208;electron oxidation of UA, with an extra electron transfer compared to the conventional two&#8208;electron pathway, which fundamentally enhances its sensitivity. Density functional theory calculations confirm the optimal SAD facilitates dual&#8208;site UA adsorption and accelerated charge transfer dynamics. This investigation provides novel insights into the strategic engineering of high&#8208;performance SAC&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by precisely controlling the atomic&#8208;scale structure of active sites.

         <title>Nucleation Engineering to Strengthen Interface Contacts in Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the nucleation barrier at the substrate surface, the nucleation process is prone to occur at the substrate, resulting in intimate interface contact, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed interface nonradiative recombination. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with improved thermal stability is achieved, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance. Herein, we report strengthening crystal/substrate contact by nucleation engineering based on in situ growth strategy. Through modulating the hole transport layer (HTL) to induce the nucleation process at substrate surface, interface residual solution, voids, and small&#8208;sized crystals are eliminated, thus ensuring intimate interface contact physically. Combining with strong interaction between perovskites and HTL, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed nonradiative recombination are achieved. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Moreover, the thermal&#8208;induced peeling&#8208;off of crystals from substrates is mitigated, which improves the device thermal stability distinctly.

         <title>Sequence Similarity Network Guided Discovery of a Dehydrogenase for Asymmetric Carbonyl Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive sequence similarity network based approach enabled the identification of a diverse array of uncharacterized enzymes from nature, leading to the discovery of several novel asymmetric carbonyl desaturation enzymes. Among them, the most outstanding enzyme, TgDH, demonstrated remarkable stereoselectivity and reactivity, catalyzing the synthesis of various chiral cyclohexenones bearing &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters with high efficiency.







Abstract
Carbonyl dehydrogenation is one of the most valuable transformations in modern synthetic chemistry. As compared to traditional chemical synthesis methods, enzymatic dehydrogenation offers a greener and more selective alternative. However, except for a few rare natural dehydrogenases for desaturation, current enzymatic methods predominantly rely on enzyme promiscuity, which often suffers from lower efficiency and limited reaction controllability. Herein, we employed sequence similarity networks to mine natural dehydrogenases from a vast array of sequences with potential dehydrogenation activity. This approach led to the discovery of an uncharacterized FAD&#8208;dependent enzyme capable of efficiently performing the desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones, thereby generating diverse cyclohexenones bearing remote &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. The current method has enhanced the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately 178&#8208;fold as compared to the best existing biocatalytic strategies and displayed almost no overoxidation reactions. Through a combination of experimental assays and computational studies, we elucidated that this enzyme enhances its dehydrogenation capability through an unconventional proton relay system, absent in previously reported enzyme promiscuity systems. Additionally, this streamlined enzymatic process demonstrated scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with maintained efficiency and selectivity, offering robust and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of chiral cyclohexenones with high optical purity.

The synthesis of chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains in single&#8208;crystal form enable chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes to be systematically investigated for the first time. Notably, NS achieves a record&#8208;high mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), which enlarges the family of emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSCs with high mobility for practical applications.







Abstract
Developing (hetero)cycloarenes, an emerging class of ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications remains significantly constrained due to their synthetic challenge and limited diversity of available materials. Herein, a series of coplanar chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains were synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form, and chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes was investigated in detailed. Sulfur&#8208;fused NS exhibits a closest herringbone crystal packing with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance as low as 3.11&#8197;&#197;, resulting in a record&#8208;high hole mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped OSCs. Remarkably, selenium&#8208;fused NSe without intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in its crystalline state, also manifests the second highest mobility of up to 2.11&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is attributed to the presence of extensive short&#8208;range edge&#8208;to&#8208;face Se&#8230;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions. Furthermore, these heterocycloarenes exhibit a selective supramolecular interaction with C70, with the trend in binding constants being: NS &lt; NO &lt; NSe. Overall, this work not only systematically elucidates the role of atom engineering on heterocycloarenes for the first time, but also paves the way for practical applications of the emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSC materials.

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three volatile imide additives with large dipole moments which improved the performance of the OSCs device by manipulating the crystallization process of the acceptor were reported. These additives could induce the acceptor to first nucleate and then grow, forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains and improving charge transport. One of the highest power conversion efficiencies of 19.04% was achieved for D18:L8&#8208;BO devices treated with pClPA.







Abstract
Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13&#8201;% to 18.58&#8201;%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04&#8201;% was achieved. Our results indicate using imide unit to construct solid additives is a simple and effective strategy, and the positional isomerization of halogen atom also has a large effect on the photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Superhelical Self&#8208;Assembly of Microcrystals from Cyclodipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

A cyclodipeptide platform delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner. Here we present a cyclodipeptide platform which delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in situ reaction&#8208;induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra&#8208;high yields and phase purity. The pathway comprises formation of subunit microcrystals and the subsequent assembly through adhesion of favorable planes. The cyclodipeptide adopts a folded geometry that generates 2D hydrogen bonded networks differing from the typical 1D duplex hydrogen bonding of diketopiperazines skeletons. The assembly of subunit crystals driven by the hydrogen bonding undergoes dislocations mediated by the inherent chirality of cyclodipeptides. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or v&#8208;DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.







Abstract
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High&#8208;performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies. In this study, we designed a series of original high&#8208;triplet PHC materials based on a multi&#8208;substitution approach of the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as a host in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on the 2,6&#8208;bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR&#8208;TADF OLED devices based on v&#8208;DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQEmax of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high&#8208;performance devices.

Devices based on the 2,6-bis(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac-Ir(tpz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR-TADF OLED devices based on &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full-width at half-maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll-off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence-sensitized MR-TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next-generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high-performance devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Closed Four&#8208;Link Chains and Borromean Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (841links) and Borromean links (632 links) have been successfully synthesized in one&#8208;step processes. The interlocked molecules were generated by the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions of bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole ligands and binuclear Cp*Rh/Ir&#8208;based precursors.







Abstract
Despite substantial advancements in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), the efficient construction of higher order links remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the highly efficient one&#8208;step directed construction of a series of unprecedented molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (84 1 metalla&#8208;links), achieved through the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions involving binuclear rhodium/iridium precursors and bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligands. Meanwhile, modulating the substituent positions of the pyridine groups in the ligand resulted in a change in topological structure, leading to the formation of two molecular Borromean links (

metalla&#8208;links). The molecular configurations of the abovementioned metalla&#8208;links were clearly identified through mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, structural transformation between the molecular Borromean links and corresponding monocycles was achieved through concentration effects, as validated by solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy investigations.

         <title>Luminescent Alkylaluminium Anthranilates Reaching Unity Quantum Yield in the Condensed Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrameric alkylaluminium anthranilates have been synthesised that&#160;exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent photoluminescence performance. In one of the complexes,&#160;intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions have been found to lead to a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Transition, post&#8208;transition and rare earth metal complexes supported by (O,N)&#8208; and (N,N)&#8208;type ligands dominate organometallic photochemistry. However, despite a vast number of aminobenzoate metal complexes having been reported, and aluminium being globally abundant, alkylaluminium anthranilates have not yet been considered as effective luminophores. Herein, using a family of commercially available ligands composed of anthranilic acid (anth&#8208;H2) and its N&#8208;substituted derivatives, we report the isolation and characterisation of a series of unique tetrameric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal alkylaluminium anthranilates, [(R'&#8208;anth)AlR]4. The resulting compounds are characterised using spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to analyse structure&#8208;determining factors in the solid state and solution. Moreover, by changing the N&#8208;substituents from H to Me and Ph, we have yielded a series of luminophores that exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent performance, providing a [(Ph&#8208;anth)AlEt]4 derivative that achieves a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase, which is unprecedented for aluminium complexes.

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trimming&#8208;&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino&#8208;metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.







Abstract
Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&#8722;2 to 1.3&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built&#8208;in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity&#8208;dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH3 and NO2 using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte was designed to break the trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity from aqueous electrolyte and the stable interface from hydrogel electrolyte, through the high ionic conductive bulk electrolyte and lean&#8208;water hydrogel&#8208;like state interface. This work paves a new way for electrolyte design towards pratical zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25&#8201;%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average coulombic efficiency (over 99.90&#8201;%). By demonstrating the remarkable performance, our work represents an advancement in zinc metal batteries toward a practical scale and is expected to set a stepping stone for transformative advancements in energy storage technologies.

         <title>A Druglike Ferrostatin&#8208;1 Analogue as a Ferroptosis Inhibitor and Photoluminescent Indicator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole as a bio&#8208;isostere of the ester group in Fer&#8208;1 not only provides druglike Ferfluor&#8208;1 with high potency and favorable blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability for a significant anti&#8208;ferroptosis effect in vivo, but also creates a unique ratiometric photoluminescent probe sensitive to the fluctuation of ferroptosis by an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) mechanism.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have long suffered from a shortage of suitable drugs and probes of high specificity. In the context of anti&#8208;ferroptosis research for neurological diseases, the inaccessibility of a blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeable small molecular ferroptosis inhibitor, and the lack of specific ferroptosis probes, seriously impeded a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis and the development of clinically applicable drugs. We report herein a novel 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole&#8208;functionalized druglike ferrostatin analogue entitled Ferfluor&#8208;1 with superior anti&#8208;ferroptosis potency, favorable BBB permeability and in vivo activity against stroke and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the exclusive pseudo&#8208;excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) property of Ferfluor&#8208;1 via a long&#8208;distance hydrogen&#8208;bonding network makes it the first sensitive ratiometric photoluminescent probe to detect phospholipid hydroperoxides and a specific indicator for the fluctuation of ferroptosis. These unprecedented advantages not only make Ferfluor&#8208;1 a potential tool for ferroptosis&#8208;related diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the central nervous system, but also pave the way to developing new theragnostic agents for precision redox detection and regulation.

         <title>Dynamic Short Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network Enhancing Hydrophilicity in Biomimetic Membranes with Artificial Water Channels for Efficient Removal of Dyes and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated biomimetic membrane combining I&#8208;quartet water channels and sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide achieves simultaneous dye and salt rejection with high water permeance. Leveraging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, this design enhances antifouling performance and provides an energy&#8208;efficient solution for textile wastewater treatment.







Abstract
The development of an integrated biomimetic membrane capable of rejecting both dyes and salts in a single step, while sustaining stable water permeation, presents a promising solution for textile wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a novel integrated biomimetic membrane integrating an I&#8208;quartet artificial water channel (AWC) with sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide (PA&#8208;SO3H), which can stably reject both dyes and inorganic salts. The I&#8208;quartet channels (2.68&#8197;&#197;), formed via self&#8208;assembly of alkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole (HC8) molecules, facilitate selective water transport and rejection of both dyes and inorganic salts. Concurrently, the sulfonic acid groups (&#8722;SO3H) could grab water molecules, forming dynamic short hydrogen&#8208;bonding network (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O). These hydrogen bonds not only serve as jumping force, lowering the energy barrier for water transport through the alternating hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic matrix, but also act as an effective antifouling barrier, significantly reducing membrane fouling. The optimal HC83.0&#8208;PA&#8208;SO3H membrane exhibits a water permeance of 13.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8208;2&#8197;h&#8208;1&#8197;MPa&#8208;1, approximately 2.7&#8208;fold higher than that of the pristine PA membrane, and both high dyes and salts rejection efficiency. Moreover, the membrane sustains stable antifouling characteristics throughout a 19&#8208;day endurance test. This innovative membrane design provides a promising solution for the efficient separation of both dyes and inorganic salts in textile wastewater treatment.

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a mussel foot protein (Mfp) membrane&#8208;enclosed zero&#8208;order controlled release system by biomimicking the working principle of the mussel plaque. The thin membrane forms directly in situ on the surface of the crystalline drugs, achieving a high drug&#8208;loading capability. In streptozotocin&#8208;induced type 1 diabetic mice, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated insulin crystals can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemia for a week. Similarly, in healthy rats, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated progesterone crystals can maintain its plasma drug concentration for up to one week.







Abstract
Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt;90&#8201;%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7&#8197;days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7&#8197;days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35&#8197;days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and the treatment of distinct diseases.

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The higher permeability of positively charged water channels Ch+ arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H&#8208;bond interactions of NH3+ groups with water compared to COO&#8722; groups in negatively charged channels Ch&#8722;, and K+ ions around COO&#8722; slowing water rotation more than Cl&#8722; ions around NH3+.







Abstract
The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8722;). The higher permeability of Ch+ channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+ and Ch&#8722; channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8722; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8722;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8722; group in Ch&#8722; channels. K+ ions concentrated around the COO&#8722; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8722; ions around the NH3+ groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels exert less stable H-bond interaction with water than the COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group in &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; channels. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions concentrated around the COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions around the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high-performance AWCs at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Ferrocenyl Aminoalcohols: Simultaneous Induction of Multiple Types of Chirality by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficient enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes with a chiral aminoalcohol group was developed via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. The desired products were obtained in excellent yield with high enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) by using phosphine&#8211;olefin ligands with a planar chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold.







Abstract
Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208;opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.

         <title>Integrated Electrochemical Biomass Oxidation and CO2 Reduction over Ultra&#8208;wide Potential Window</title>

A Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V and a large CO partial current density of 608.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Integrated solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo&#8208;isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release performance using these light&#8208;responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.







Abstract
Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8211;270&#8197;nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8211;2.14&#8197;nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7&#8197;times greater than that of electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ionogels from Dynamic Polyrotaxane&#8208;Based Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes were designed by introducing ionic liquid to dynamically crosslinked polyrotaxane networks. The competitive coordination of lithium ions between the polymer chain segments and the ionic liquid molecular clusters facilitates lithium&#8208;ion migration. The ionogel electrolyte enables lithium symmetrical cells with stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours and the NMC622||Li battery with excellent rate and cycling performance at 20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The swelling of a polymer matrix by ionic liquids and additional lithium salts may lead to the formation of ionogel electrolytes. However, the introduction of additional ions usually results in a decreased lithium&#8208;ion transference number, because of the trapping of the lithium ions in clusters and polymer&#8208;ion complexes. Achieving highly efficient lithium&#8208;ion migration and increasing lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium&#8208;ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and tLi+=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium&#8208;lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.

Achieving highly efficient lithium-ion migration and increasing lithium-ion transference number (t&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium-ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium-lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulated Multicomponent Reaction Pathway by Pore&#8208;Confinement Effect in MOFs for Highly Efficient Catalysis of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully modulated reaction pathway in the multicomponent reaction of propargylic amines, phosphine oxide and CO2 through the confinement effect of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a catalyst. The MOF with pores of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; can selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, preferentially react to form oxazolidinones, which further react with the phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce the final product. This result in high catalytic performance and excellent substrate generality.







Abstract
The conversion of flue gas CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond&#8208;formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free framework (Cu&#8208;TCA) was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO2 by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; in Cu&#8208;TCA selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger&#8208;sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO2 and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in Cu&#8208;TCA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of Cu&#8208;TCA with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Negative Hydrogen with Bimetallic&#8208;Ternary&#8208;Structured Catalysts for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen evolution form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1 and achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours using AB as H in converting nitrobenzene to anilines.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) with in situ negative hydrogen (H&#8722;) has received extensive attention as an alternative to conventional high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation processes. However, the insufficient activity of hydrogen production and unclear the conversion process of hydrogenation remain a great challenge. In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary&#8208;structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1&#8208;TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H&#8722; donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB. Mechanistic studies revealed that the high hydrolysis activity was due to that the Ru SA and Co SA sites of the bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalyst required the lowest energy for the activation of AB and H2O, respectively. Remarkably, the Co SA and Ru clusters exhibited an obvious synergistic effect in the TH process, which promoted the tandem hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. This work demonstrated an efficient approach to generate H&#8722; donor with bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts in TH process and further provided new inspiration on the development of multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme Surface Residues Direct Encapsulation into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Performance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to guide the formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by exposing surface residues of proteins, thereby embedding enzymes into MOFs. Nitrogen&#8208;enriched Cyt&#8197;c serves as a model to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, leading to significantly improve enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency. The strategy is applicable for a variety of enzymes, demonstrating the potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Herein, we highlight the role of nitrogen&#8208;enriched surface groups on proteins in directing topological transformations of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Using a modified&#8208;protein&#8208;directed MOFs template synthesis (mDTS) strategy, we demonstrate that these surface modifications on cytochrome c (Cyt&#8197;c) selectively induce the formation of leaf&#8208;like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;L). This approach not only enables a structural transition from ZIF&#8208;8 to a more open ZIF&#8208;L framework but also substantially enhances the catalytic activity and loading of Cyt&#8197;c beyond traditional immobilization methods. Adjusting the concentration of the surface modifier allows for precise tuning of the Cyt&#8197;c activity, allowing optimal enzyme function at specific modifier levels. Furthermore, our results reveal that surface modifications of a variety of proteins can facilitate the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, emphasizing the broad applicability of the mDTS method. This approach offers significant promise for developing highly efficient protein&#8208;MOF composites, offering transformative potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Reduction and Biosynthesis Towards Sustainable CO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

This work delivers a photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO2 into long&#8208;chain sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added compounds.







Abstract
Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) into long&#8208;chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value&#8208;added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO2 reduction to energy&#8208;rich sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO2 to CH4 with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#946;+). Subsequently, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene using photocatalytically&#8208;obtained CH4 as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a green, low&#8208;energy pathway for the synthesis of long&#8208;chain compounds from CO2 as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long&#8208;term energy demands and sustainable CO2 upcycling.

&lt;p&gt;This work delivers a photocatalysis-biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into long-chain sucrose or &#945;-farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to value-added compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into long-chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value-added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis-biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to energy-rich sucrose or &#945;-farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as-prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Subsequently, &lt;i&gt;Methylomicrobium buryatense&lt;/i&gt; 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;-farnesene using photocatalytically-obtained CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This study provides a green, low-energy pathway for the synthesis of long-chain compounds from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long-term energy demands and sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upcycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given that chiral bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are stacked straight forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assembly, eight assemblies with different symmetries can be considered. In this study, seven of eight assemblies are selectively synthesized with minimal alternations in their molecular structures. These assemblies will be useful for the quantitative discussion for structure&#8211;property relationship.







Abstract
Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent that enables previously inaccessible radical chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of alkenes, as well as highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of heteroarenes. The method involves conversion of the weakly electrophilic bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate into a masked electrophile, significantly increasing its reactivity, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates 515 candidate structures featuring a planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atom, adhering to the 18 valence electron rule and formulated as OXnYmq. Among these, 35 global minima were identified, primarily stabilized by Group 13 elements with charge states spanning &#8722;1 to +1. Notably, bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions&#8212;from covalent to polar ionic&#8212;that challenge traditional assumptions about unconventional oxygen bonding motifs.







Abstract
Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OXnYmq, where n+m=4, q ranging from +2 to &#8722;2, and following the 18&#8208;valence electron rule. High&#8208;level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group&#8197;13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO&#8208;containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas&#8208;phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Boosted Stability and Kinetics under a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce silk fibroin (SF) as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, boosting the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of aqueous Zn ion batteries across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. SF disrupts H&#8208;bond networks in H2O and coordinates Zn2+, reducing viscosity and suppressing side reactions. It also forms a hydrophilic/zincophilic SF&#8208;film on both electrodes, enabling uniform Zn plating and preventing cathode dissolution.







Abstract
Sustainable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) necessitate a wide operational temperature range to ensure practicability, yet achieving this often compromises either reaction kinetics at low temperatures or cycling stability at high temperatures. Here we present an electrolyte design that balances this trade&#8208;off, enhancing the stability and kinetics of AZIBs across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Our approach incorporates silk fibroin as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, which modifies both electrolyte structure and electrode interphase. Specifically, Zn||Zn half&#8208;cells with this electrolyte realize low hysteresis (180&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and stable operation (200&#8197;hours at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This electrolyte is compatible with both inorganic and organic cathode materials. Remarkably, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level Zn||V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&#8722;1 with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries at extreme temperatures.

Remarkably, an ampere-hour-level Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>From Holodirected to Hemidirected Coordination Activated by Oxygenation Strategy: A Facile Route to Long Wave Infrared Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair electrons of Sb3+ in halides can be activated by oxygen atom, which inspired the creation of the first alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalide Rb2Sb2OCl6. Its birefringence has been increased by an order of magnitude compared with the holodirected coordination Rb13Sb8Cl37. Large&#8208;sized crystal measurements show that Rb2Sb2OCl6 features a good transmittance from 0.4 to 13.5&#8197;&#956;m, covering the near, mid and long wave infrared range, confirming its potential as a long wave infrared birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Long wave infrared (LWIR) birefringent crystals are essential for infrared optical applications but such materials are rarely reported due to the requirements of large birefringence and wide infrared transmission range. This study proposes a facile route to create new LWIR birefringent crystal by oxygenation strategy in halides with cations containing lone pair electrons. Given the tendency of such cations to form holodirected geometry, a divalent oxygen was introduced to substitute the monovalent halogen to decrease the coordination number and activate the lone pair electrons. Our efforts in Rb+&#8208;Sb3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; system result three new structures, namely, Rb13Sb8Cl37, Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6. The holodirected SbCl6 in Rb13Sb8Cl37 has been successfully translated to hemidirected SbOCl4 in Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb2Sb2OCl6 reached to 0.191@550&#8197;nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb13Sb8Cl37 (0.017@550&#8197;nm). Large&#8208;sized crystal of Rb2Sb2OCl6 have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2&#8197;mm3). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8211;13.5&#8197;&#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system &#8211; alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.

         <title>Re and Ru Co&#8208;Doped Transition Metal Alloy as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrooxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Re co&#8208;doped NiCoFe alloy exhibited efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. By employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously with a stable operation over 450&#8197;h.







Abstract
Glycerol electrooxidation (GOR), as an innovative strategy for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, is considered a promising anodic alternative to oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis. However, the high potential and the limited selectivity and faradaic efficiency impede the industrial&#8208;scale application toward GOR. Herein, we for the first time constructed rhenium and ruthenium co&#8208;doped transition metal alloy (NiCoFeRuRe) for the efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. Benefiting from the rapid generation of M3+&#8208;OOH induced by Ru element and the inhibition of OER and excessive oxidation of glycerol by Re species through in situ chacterization, the optimized NiCoFeRuRe requires only 1.133 VRHE to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a faradaic efficiency of 95.6&#8201;% for formate product with a stability more than 450&#8197;h. Importantly, employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously, which is 265&#8197;mV lower than the electrolytic water splitting owning an excellent stability of 350&#8197;h. This work provides a facile strategy for rationally designing high&#8208;performance GOR catalysts for biomass upgradings.

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>

A facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy is applied to create NMP&#8208;SACs consisting of Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC) for exceptional HER activity. As an H&#8208;pump, Con supply hydrogen for Pt1 sites through accelerated water dissociation, enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.







Abstract
Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.

         <title>Niobium Phosphide&#8208;Induced Sulfur Cathode Interface with Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Flux Enables Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbP induces the decomposition of lithium salts, which resulting in the formation of a LiF&#8208; and LiN&#8208;rich interfacial layer at the sulfur cathode interface for facilitating high&#8208;flux Li+ transport. The optimized interface reduces the conversion energy barrier of Li2S and effectively prevents the passivation of catalytic active sites.







Abstract

         <title>Synthesis of Selenium&#8208;Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes have been synthesized to unveil the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host molecules. Compared to oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based analogues, selenium&#8208;embedded host enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling, accelerates reverse intersystem crossing, and improves bipolar transport, enabling the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a wide color gamut.







Abstract
The internal heavy&#8208;atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium&#8208;doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylselanyl)pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz&#8208;BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BFP) and sulfur&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz&#8208;BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz&#8208;BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high&#8208;performance, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut TADF&#8208;OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph&#8208;OLEDs) and TADF&#8208;sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Battery with Highly Reversible Bromine Conversion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

ZnSO4 solution is initially screened as the electrolyte for bromide cathodes. Subsequently, a targeted sequestration strategy is proposed to modify KBr cathode, achieving high&#8208;reversibility bromine conversion chemistry. In situ Raman spectra reveal a Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722;&#8208;dominated conversion mechanism. A large&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;Br pouch cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 98.46&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92&#8201;% after 775 cycles at 3&#8197;C.







Abstract
Br2/Br&#8722; conversion reaction with a high operating potential (1.85&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn) is promising for designing high&#8208;energy cathodes in aqueous Zn batteries. However, the ultrahigh solubility of polybromides causes significant shuttle effects, capacity deterioration, and self&#8208;discharge, rendering the study of static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries still in its infancy. Here, various aqueous zinc salt electrolytes are first screened, showing that, compared to other salts, ZnSO4 is more suitable for Br&#8208;based cathodes benefiting from its higher negative charge density and lower cost. Nevertheless, the significant shuttle effect of polybromides remains in such an electrolyte. We further develop a targeted sequestration strategy to fundamentally confine polybromide migration from KBr cathode into electrolyte. In high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (22 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) pouch cells, the average Coulombic efficiency enhances from 92.3&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;%, and self&#8208;discharge performance dramatically improves from 17.4&#8201;% capacity retention to 85.2&#8201;% after 72&#8197;h of resting, indicating the effectiveness of our strategy in confining the shuttle effects. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell delivers an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.88&#8201;% and a zinc utilization of 22&#8201;% at a high rate of 3&#8197;C. Our findings also pave the way for the design of advanced Br&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 20/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present menace: Emissions of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8212;forever chemicals&#8212;represent a risk for the environment and human health. However, mitigation strategies lack. In their Minireview (e202424718), Patrick Lott, Florian Maurer, and Arik Beck discuss a roadmap on how to tackle PFAS emission in the gas phase using catalysis. Their cover art pays tribute to the iconic movie poster of the masterpiece Star Wars Episode 1, showing a CF4 molecule shadowing its past as long&#8208;chain PFAS onto a catalyst surface.

         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical&#8208;assisted approach converts elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymers with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) junctions, mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO2 photoreduction with H2O, without additional photosensitizers, sacrificial agents, or cocatalysts. The key innovation is a mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction, enabling sustainable solid&#8208;state condensation of sulfur with 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes to form bent thianthrene units.

         <title>Sustainable Pathways for the Synthesis of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite) plays a key role in construction as a hydraulic binder. Due to its instability in water, industrial production primarily relies on thermal dehydration of gypsum. This review examines alternative, potentially more sustainable methods for the synthesis of bassanite, including gypsum conversion at lower temperatures and direct precipitation from organic solvents or in the presence of specific additives. The benefits, drawbacks, and overall impact on sustainability of the different proposed approaches are critically assessed.







Abstract
Calcium sulfate, and especially its hemihydrate form (bassanite), is crucial in the construction industry, primarily used as a hydraulic binder in cements, mortars, and wallboards. Because of the rapid transformation of bassanite into thermodynamically stable gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) upon contact with water, natural deposits are scarce, rendering it one of the most extensively produced inorganic materials worldwide. Currently, bassanite is derived from mined or waste gypsum through a thermal dehydration process, which is energy&#8208;intensive and costly. As sustainability has become a key target for industrial processes and products, a series of studies aiming to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of bassanite production was published recently. Two primary approaches are pursued: conversion of gypsum and direct precipitation of bassanite from solution. In both cases, organic solvents, (specific) additives and/or elevated temperatures have been used to control the activity/availability of water in the reaction medium and thus direct phase selection towards bassanite. This review offers a comprehensive overview of alternative bassanite production methods, critically examining their benefits, potential downsides, and overall impact on the sustainability of industrial&#8208;scale use.

         <title>Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of PFAS emission abatement, this minireview addresses catalytic gas phase PFAS decomposition and the associated overarching challenges involving fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction engineering. In addition, concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions are introduced.







Abstract
While the outstanding stability of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted in their nickname &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;. The rising awareness for PFAS&#8208;related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas&#8208;solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereoelements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights recent advances in the construction of nonadjacent stereogenic elements and summarizes the various strategies employed, including bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis, and other approaches. The synthetic applications and mechanistic investigations are also discussed to facilitate understanding of this field.








Abstract
Nonadjacent chiral scaffolds are privileged motifs in bioactive molecules and medicines, which have stimulated chemists&#8217; ingenuity in achieving the asymmetric construction of non&#8208;contiguous chiral elements directly. Current strategies include bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis and others, enabling the production of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds featuring different combinations of nonadjacent chirality, including multiple elements of central chirality, central and allenyl axial chirality, and central and biaryl axial chirality. As compared to the patterns of multiple nonadjacent elements of central chirality, the latter two are less frequently reported. This minireview aims to summarize the key developments in reaction design, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications, with the goal of stimulating further exploration in this important area of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Sulfur Conversion to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder Polymer Networks through Mechanochemical Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state synthetic approach was developed to directly convert elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor molecular junctions, by exploiting mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting sulfur&#8208;rich conjugated polymer exhibits successful CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapor, without adding any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods capable of converting elemental sulfur into conjugated porous sulfur&#8208;rich polymers remains a great challenge, although direct utilization of this readily available feedstock can significantly enrich its uses and circumvent environmental problems during sulfur storage. We report herein mechanochemical (MC) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) that enables sulfur conversion into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) molecular junctions. We demonstrate that the key lies in the generation of bent thianthrene units through a solid&#8208;state ball&#8208;milling condensation reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes and elemental sulfur. We also show that the assembling of D&#8722;A structural motifs into porous networks affords efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. Exceptional photoinduced charge separation along with boosted exciton dissociation results in a high&#8208;performance of carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 306.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by H2O oxidation to O2, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical results. We anticipate this novel MC SNAr approach will advance processing techniques for direct sulfur utilization and facilitate new possibilities for the synthesis of D&#8722;A ladder polymer networks with promising potential in photocatalysis.

         <title>Profiling Allosteric Modulators of CB1R with an Allosteric Fluoroprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based assay to directly profile CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) independently of orthosteric radioligands. Our fluorescent tracer allows for distinction between allosteric and orthosteric ligands and reliable determination of CB1R AM binding affinities. (TOC Figure created in BioRender. Ganzoni, R.

Abstract
Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi=5.34 and 5.67, respectively).

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of four highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing different glycoforms has been achieved via an efficient chemoenzymatic approach, relying on the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that sialylated glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enzymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Cocatalyst for Hydroquinone Oxidation Enables Aerobic Oxidation of Primary Alcohols to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercially available heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst supports efficient aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone, outperforming homogeneous molecular cobalt and iron cocatalysts that have been used to support redox cascades. This Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/benzoquinone cocatalyst system supports the highly efficient oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a homogeneous Ir catalyst in organic solvent.







Abstract
Benzoquinone (BQ) is commonly used as a cocatalyst in multi&#8208;component catalyst systems for aerobic oxidation of organic molecules. Such methods often proceed by a redox cascade in which a secondary catalyst supports aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to BQ. The present study shows that a commercially available non&#8208;precious metal heterogeneous catalyst, PAJ&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, is much more efficient than established homogeneous catalysts for aerobic oxidation of HQ to BQ, and this improved reactivity is crucial to support aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with the homogeneous iridium catalyst, [Ir(trop2DAD]OTf (trop2DAD=N,N&#8208;bis(5&#8208;H&#8208;dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene). The combination of this heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyst system operates with Ir catalyst loadings as low as 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover frequencies &#8805;350&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn3Si4P11 demonstrates superior second&#8208;harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn3Si4P9.







Abstract
Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds.

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates superior second-harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second-harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi-asymmetric-module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand-new non-centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, which showcases the characteristics of a three-dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] and [In&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from the kindred SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30-fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5-fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry in a Capillary Applied to the Facilitation of the Crystalline Sponge Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;One&#8208;droplet&#8221; host&#8211;guest chemistry was achieved by using a glass capillary, enabling the efficient crystallization and structure determination of various host&#8211;guest complexes. Two coordination hosts, the cage and the crystalline sponge (CS), were examined. Notably, using a capillary addressed several persistent technical challenges in the CS method, greatly simplifying and accelerating the analysis of molecular structures.







Abstract
Capillary is a handy tool for transferring, mixing, and storing small volumes of liquid. Here, we show that the stepwise dipping of host and guest solutions into a capillary allows efficient preparation, crystallization, and X&#8208;ray analysis of various host&#8211;guest complexes. The crystals formed in capillaries are comparable in quality to those grown in regular flasks and subjected to X&#8208;ray analysis without being removed from the capillary. We further apply the capillary technique to the crystalline sponge method, a practical domain of host&#8211;guest chemistry, successfully overcoming several technical issues.

The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called lithium anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC). X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies reveal that Li(ADC) exist as lithium acetylides Li(ACT). Exposure of Li(ACT) to CO2 and N2O readily afford ADC&#8208;compounds Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] and Li[(ADC)N2O], respectively.







Abstract
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts (IPr&#8208;Ar)X (1&#8208;Ar)X (IPr&#8208;Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Ar = Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (2&#8208;Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}2). 2&#8208;Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid&#8208;state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]n (3&#8208;Ar) dimeric (n = 2) or trimeric (n = 3) molecular structure for 2&#8208;Ar. Treatment of 3&#8208;Ph with Et3B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt3)] (4&#8208;Ph) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. 3&#8208;Ar readily undergo reactions with CO2 and N2O to form the ring&#8208;closing products Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] (5&#8208;Ar) and Li[(ADC)N2O] (6&#8208;Ar), respectively.

         <title>Borohydride Oxidation as Counter Reaction in Reductive Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, anodic borohydride oxidation is demonstrated to have great potential for successfully replacing sacrificial metal anodes in a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic counter reaction effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 at inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.







Abstract
An efficient reaction at the counter electrode is of key importance for the success of net oxidative and net reductive electrochemical transformations. For electrooxidative processes, cathodic proton reduction to H2 serves as the benchmark counter reaction. In contrast, net reductive electrochemical transformations have less attractive oxidative counter reactions to choose from and commonly rely on dissolution of a sacrificial anode that effectively results in stoichiometric metal consumption for the processes. In this study, we demonstrate that anodic borohydride oxidation has great potential to successfully replace the use of such sacrificial anodes for a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic transformation effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 using inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first stable geminal 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane is reported. Remarkably, the novel 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane exhibits three distinct structural motifs in the solid state, which are determined by the synthesis conditions: (1)&#8197;an unsolvated co&#8208;aggregate of two 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannanes with two silyllithium molecules; (2)&#8197;an ionic solvated trimeric stannyllithium dianion associated with two THF&#8208;solvated Li+ cations; (3)&#8197;a THF&#8208;solvated dimeric contact&#8208;ion pair of 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Dual Ammonia Activation and Transfer by an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Boryloxy Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the first single&#8208;site main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dual activation of ammonia (NH3) to hydrogen (H2) using a low&#8208;valent aluminyl compound. This transformation is driven by a (coordination/proton shuttling) N&#8722;H oxidative addition pathway and selective protonolysis. These findings highlight the potential of main&#8208;group complexes in traditionally transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated transformations.







Abstract
The reactivity of an N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al] reacts with excess NH3 to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] and in the process generates H2. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8722;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8722;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H2. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&#8722; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH2]&#8722; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO2 and Ph2CO) has been demonstrated.

         <title>Photogeneration and Visualization of a Surface&#8208;Stabilized Dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication we report the formation of a stable, surface&#8208;supported dinitrene achieved through the photolysis of a diazide precursor on an Au(111) metal substrate. We combine high&#8208;resolution scanning probe techniques with theoretical calculations, providing the first real&#8208;space imaging of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface and exploring the associated photoreaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.

         <title>Promoting the Kinetics of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via the Facet&#8208;Dependent Activation of Acetylene over Silver Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;dependent acetylene activation phenomenon over silver (Ag) catalysts is discovered, and Ag (100) is selected as a suitable candidate to increase the hydrogenation kinetics to improve the activity of ethylene electrosynthesis through the electrocatalytic acetylene conversion process. In addition, the activation of acetylene (C2H2) is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation, guiding future catalyst design.







Abstract
Metallic silver (Ag) sites exhibit a robust ability to suppress undesired C&#8722;C coupling in the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) into ethylene (ESAE), leading to satisfactory selectivity and stability. However, the relatively low reaction kinetics still hinder its practical value. Here, the facet&#8208;dependent ESAE performance is first evaluated to increase the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics and provide mechanistic insight for subsequent catalyst design. As a result, the Ag nanocubes with {100} surfaces demonstrate a partial current density of 337&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, greatly outperforming their counterparts with {111} surfaces exposed. Further comparisons of H2O splitting and C2H2 hydrogenation reveal that the activation of C2H2 is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of ethylene electrosynthesis. Additionally, experimental and theoretical mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that stronger C2H2 adsorption over the {100} surface strengthens the &#960; conjugation of C2H2, leading to the delocalization of &#960; electrons to promote the activation of C2H2 for enhanced hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Dynamic Ultralong Phosphorescence and Optical Waveguiding Switches in Silver&#8208;Organic Complex via Reversible Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal conversion and the heavy&#8208;atom effect, dynamically controllable ultralong phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable optical waveguide can be designed within an Ag&#8208;organic complex. This approach provides a straightforward way to expand room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence towards intelligent switches and Information storage.







Abstract
Dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light&#8208;emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)&#8208;organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Ag+ ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag&#8208;based complex displays reversible solvent&#8208;responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent&#8208;mediated single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color&#8208;tunable active optical waveguides and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polarization switching.

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging single-crystal-to-single-crystal conversion and the heavy-atom effect, dynamically controllable ultralong phosphorescence and color-tunable optical waveguide can be designed within an Ag-organic complex. This approach provides a straightforward way to expand room-temperature phosphorescence towards intelligent switches and Information storage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic ultralong room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli-responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light-emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)-organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy-atom effect of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag-based complex displays reversible solvent-responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent-mediated single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color-tunable active optical waveguides and one-dimensional (1D) polarization switching. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for creating dynamically controllable ultralong all-phosphorescent metal-organic complexes and advances the design of stimuli-responsive 1D photonic systems for promising information encryption and anti-counterfeiting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate Aldolase for anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>

The anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is promoted by an engineered variant of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA), giving rise to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent enantiopurity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Arylations and Alkenylations of 2&#8208;Aminobiaryls with Atmospheric Air as the Sole Oxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a mild, enantioselective method for the arylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aminobiaryl compounds to produce highly valuable, enantioenriched anilines exhibiting axial chirality. The kinetic resolution process is catalyzed by Pd(II) in combination with an isobutyryl&#8208;protected isoleucine ligand (iBoc&#8208;Ile&#8208;OH), using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant and DMSO as cosolvent. The products can be divergently manipulated to give optically active, axially chiral derivatives of high interest for asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Optically active 2&#8208;aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8722;C coupling product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the in situ formation of a phospholipid and its chemical energy driven assembly into transient vesicles. Our synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which are uniform and 65&#8197;nm in diameter, were obtained by a metabolism&#8208;like process i.e., formation by simply mixing the precursors and simultaneous degradation by an enzyme. This results in temporally controlled vesicles. Moreover, the cargo release from our vesicles can be dynamically regulated for drug delivery.







Abstract
Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio&#8208;inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self&#8208;assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic&#8208;like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double&#8208;tailed, vesicle&#8208;forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65&#8197;nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery.

     alt="Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the in situ formation of a phospholipid and its chemical energy driven assembly into transient vesicles. Our synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which are uniform and 65&#8197;nm in diameter, were obtained by a metabolism-like process i.e., formation by simply mixing the precursors and simultaneous degradation by an enzyme. This results in temporally controlled vesicles. Moreover, the cargo release from our vesicles can be dynamically regulated for drug delivery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio-inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self-assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic-like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double-tailed, vesicle-forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65&#8197;nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub-100&#8197;nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery. We have demonstrated that the release kinetics of the incorporated cargo molecules can be dynamically regulated for potential applications in adaptive nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
