         <title>W&#8208;mediated electron accumulation in Ru&#8208;O&#8208;W motifs enables ultra&#8208;stable oxygen evolution reaction in acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is crucial for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology, especially in the pursuit of non&#8208;iridium alternatives. Herein, we report a Zn, W co&#8208;doping Ru3Zn0.85W0.15Ox (RZW) ternary oxide catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 200 mV and remarkable stability for over 4000 hours at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.1 M HClO4. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released from the sacrificial Zn species during OER, and subsequently mediated to Ru sites. The observed enhancement in electron density within the stable Ru&#8208;O&#8208;W motifs substantially improve the anti&#8208;overoxidation properties of the Ru active sites. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic metal doping in modulating the electronic structure of OER catalysts during operation, thereby facilitating the development of practical and long&#8208;lasting water electrolysis technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bias&#8208;free solar&#8208;driven ammonia coupled to C3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone production through photoelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of solar energy into value&#8208;added chemicals through photoelectrochemistry (PEC) holds great potential for advancing sustainable development but limits by high onset potential which affects energy conversion efficiencies. Herein, we utilized a CuPd cocatalyst&#8208;modified Sb2(S,Se)3 photocathode (CuPd/TSSS) to achieve an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of 0.83 VRHE for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis. Meanwhile, we achieved unbiased NH3 production by synthesizing major value&#8208;added C3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) through glycerol oxidation on the BiVO4 photoanode with the loading Pd cocatalyst, instead of a traditional solar water oxidation reaction. The PEC integrated system stably produced 11.98 &#181;mol cm&#8208;2 of NH3 and 201.9 mmol m&#8208;2 of DHA over 5 h with ~80% faradaic efficiency without applying additional bias. In situ analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed high catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis at the CuPd/TSSS photocathode and enhanced selectivity for DHA at the Pd/BiVO4 photoanode. This design represents a breakthrough in directly utilizing solar energy, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater, and biomass waste for ammonia and highly value&#8208;added C3 production, which addresses increasing energy demands while decreasing environmental impact.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deconstruction of Polyolefins: A Strategy to Up&#8208;cycle the Waste Polyethylene to Value&#8208;Added Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from post&#8208;consumer waste polyolefins is fascinating as well as challenging. Here we report ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed up&#8208;cycling of the polyethylene to long&#8208;chain alkene derivatives. The developed methodology mainly involves two steps i.e., dehydrogenation of polyethylene through hydrogen atom transfer and its metathesis using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene using ruthenium catalysis derived up to 3.38%, of double bonds; with 90% of the recovered polyolefin material. The obtained unsaturated polyethylene was subjected to cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using HG&#8208;II catalytic system.&#160; This resulted in the synthesis of predominantly dodecene (C12) derivatives, with 58% selectivity, along with other derivatives of varying chain lengths. The overall reaction produced terminal and internal olefins in the ratio 1:0.8 respectively.&#160; The dehydrogenation of polyethylene and its deconstruction was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The origin of C12 selectivity has been demonstrated by control experiments. The scope of the methodology was extended to post&#8208;consumer waste polyethylene gave high conversion of value&#8208;added dodecene derivatives as a major product.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry to Probe Sequences in Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of the microstructure of supramolecular copolymers is difficult because of their dynamic character. Here, benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) co&#8208;assemblies are analysed by ion mobility &#8208; mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) to reveal the presence of various sequences. For example, the IM&#8208;MS mobilogram for hexamers composed of 4 units from a first monomer and 2 units from a second monomer is a broad distribution due to the presence of 9 possible isomeric sequences, which can be sorted out based on calculated collision cross&#8208;sections. This approach gives unprecedented information on supramolecular copolymer sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>High Spin&#8208;State Modulation of Catalytic Centers by Weak Ligand Field for Promoting Sulfur Redox Reaction in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic state of the 3d orbital in the catalytic active center of Co2+ can be predictably configured into a high&#8208;spin arrangement (t2g5eg2) through the weak ligand field effect of F. The CoF2 catalyst, compared to CoO with the low&#8208;spin state of Co2+ (t2g6eg1), can form strong interactions with sulfur species through Co&#8722;S and Li&#8722;F bonds, facilitating the cleavage of S&#8722;S bond from both ends and promoting their conversion kinetics in LSBs.







Abstract
The spin state of transition&#8208;metal compounds in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) significantly impacts the electronic properties and the kinetics of sulfur redox reactions (SRR). However, accurately designing the spin state remains challenging, which is crucial for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship and developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, the CoF2, specifically the Co2+ with 3d7 electrons in a high&#8208;spin state distribution (t2g5eg2), were tailored predictably for the first time through the weak coordination field effect of the F element. Both DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the spin state of Co2+ transitions from low&#8208; to high&#8208;spin configurations and strongly interacts with sulfur species through Co&#8722;S and Li&#8722;F bonds during the SRR process. This interaction weakens the S&#8722;S bond, promoting its facile cleavage from both ends while also facilitating the rapid and uniform nucleation of Li2S2/Li2S, thus resulting in LSBs with a capacity of 447.7 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8201;C rates and stable cycling for 1000 cycles, with an acceptable practical capacity of 585&#8201;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high sulfur loading mass of 10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work achieves rational control of the active Co2+ d electron state through the field effect and enriches the application of spin control to accelerate SRR in LSBs.

         <title>Unleashed Remarkable Energy Storage Performance in Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based Relaxor Ferroelectrics by Local Structural Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the representative Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 ferroelectric relaxor as a model system, we have significantly enhanced its overall dielectric energy&#8208;storage performance by subtly enhancing the local structural fluctuation. The ultrahigh energy density, high efficiency, and ultrafast discharging speed, along with their superior working stabilities, make the designed ceramic a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors.







Abstract
Dielectric capacitors harvest energy through an electrostatic storage process, which enables an ultrafast charging&#8208;discharging rate and ultrahigh power density. However, achieving high energy density (Wrec) and efficiency (&#951;) simultaneously, especially when preserving them across a wide frequency/temperature range or cycling numbers, remains challenging. In this work, by especially introducing NaTaO3 into the representative ferroelectric relaxor of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 and leveraging the mismatch between B&#8208;site atoms, we proposed a method of enhancing local structural fluctuation to refine the polar configuration and to effectively improve its overall energy&#8208;storage performances. As a consequence, the ceramic exhibits an ultrahigh Wrec of 15.0&#8197;J/cm3 and high &#951; up to 80&#8201;%, along with a very wide frequency stability of 10&#8211;200&#8197;Hz and extensive cycling number up to 108. In&#8208;depth local structure and chemical environment investigations, consisting of atom&#8208;scale electron microscopy, neutron total scattering, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, reveal that the randomly distributed A/B&#8208;site atom pairs emerge in the system, leading to the evident local structural fluctuations and concomitant polymorphic polar nanodomains. These key ingredients contribute to the large polarization, minimal hysteresis, and high breakdown strength, thereby promoting energy&#8208;storage performances. This work opens a new path for designing high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors via manipulating local structural fluctuations.

         <title>Coplanar Atropochiral 5H&#8208;Cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dipyridine Ligands: Synthesis and Applications in Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of coplanar atropochiral bipyridine ligands endowed with an axially chiral scaffold has been designed and synthesized. Two synthetic pathways are developed to access these bipyridines. These atropochiral diazafluorenes ligands have been successfully applied in copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of cyclic diaryliodoniums with bulky secondary amines, affording the axially chiral tertiary amines with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Bipyridines represent a class of ligands renowned for their versatility and efficacy in numerous transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Chiral bipyridine ligands are noted for their distinctive reactivity and stereoselectivity. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a class of bipyridine ligands endowed with an axially chiral scaffold. These ligands feature: (a) a precisely aligned coplanar bipyridine framework that is beneficial for metal chelation; (b) a spacious environment around the metal&#8208;bipyridine complexes, capable of hosting substrates with substantial steric bulk; (c) a chiral pocket induced by the axially chiral architecture. These atropochiral planar bipyridine ligands were successfully applied in copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of cyclic diaryliodoniums with bulky secondary amines, achieving high efficiency and stereoselectivity that were unsuccessful in our previous efforts.

         <title>Ethanol Processable Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Hole Transporting Layers Enabled 20.12&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcased a high&#8208;performance hybrid hole transport layer based on Nb2O5 and 2PACz by using ethanol&#8208;soluble alkoxide precursors and a self&#8208;assembled monolayer, which enhanced interfacial contact and defect passivation, thus delivering high PCEs up to 20.12% in organic solar cells.







Abstract
In this study, a high&#8208;performance inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid hole transporting layer (HTL) was developed using ethanol&#8208;soluble alkoxide precursors and a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM). Three metal oxides&#8208;vanadium oxide (VOx), niobium oxide (Nb2O5), and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)&#8208;were synthesized through successive low&#8208;temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments of their respective precursors: vanadium oxytriethoxide (EtO&#8722;V), niobium ethoxide (EtO&#8722;Nb), and tantalum ethoxide (EtO&#8722;Ta). Among these, the Nb2O5 film exhibited excellent transmittance, a high work function, and good conductivity, along with a more compact and uniform structure featuring fewer interfacial defects, which facilitated efficient charge extraction and transport. Furthermore, the deposition of a SAM of (2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PACz) on top of Nb2O5 further passivated defects, enhancing interfacial contact with the photoactive layer. The resulting inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid HTL of Nb2O5/2PACz demonstrated excellent compatibility with various photoactive blends, achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies of 19.44&#8201;%, 19.18&#8201;%, and 20.12&#8201;% for the PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, and D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 based organic solar cells, respectively. 20.12&#8201;% is the best performance for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells with binary components as the photoactive layer.

         <title>Subcellular Compartment&#8208;Specific Amplified Imaging of Metal Ions via Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Regulated DNAzyme Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNAzyme&#8208;based sensing technology is established for subcellular compartment (e.g. mitochondria or cytosol) specific imaging of metal ions through ribosomal RNA&#8208;regulated activation and signal amplification. The system not only significantly enhances sensitivity and spatial precision for metal&#8208;ion imaging in specific organelles, but also enables in situ monitoring of subcellular Zn2+ dynamics during ischemia and the drug intervention.







Abstract
Although DNAzyme sensors have been widely developed for imaging metal ions, their application in specific subcellular compartments remains challenging due to low spatial controllability. Here we present a locally activatable, DNAzyme&#8208;based sensing technology that enables subcellular compartment&#8208;specific imaging of metal ions through ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regulated signal amplification. The system leverages a subcellularly encoded rRNA to locally activate DNAzyme&#8208;based sensors, and further drives signal amplification via multiple turnover cleavage of molecular beacons, to significantly enhance sensitivity and spatial precision for metal&#8208;ion imaging in specific organelles (e.g. mitochondria) or membraneless compartments (e.g. cytosol). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system allows in situ monitoring of subcellular dynamics of mitochondrial Zn2+ during ischemia and the drug intervention. This study expands the DNAzyme toolbox for investigating the role of subcellular metal&#8208;ion dynamics in disease processes.

Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross coupling. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross&#8208;coupling reactions without the use of external light source, heat, precious metal complex, or trapping agents. A plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion platform is utilized for introduction of hydrazine reagent that undergoes homolytic cleavage forming radical intermediate species. The non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge that causes the cleavage originates from a chemically etched silica capillary. The coupling of the radical intermediates gives various products. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry. The platform is applied herein with a variety of hydrazine substrates, enabling i) self&#8208;coupling to form secondary amines with identical N&#8208;substitutions, ii) cross&#8208;coupling to afford secondary amine with different N&#8208;substituents, iii) cross&#8208;coupling followed by in&#8197;situ dehydrogenation to give the corresponding aryl&#8208;aldimines with two unique N&#8208;substitutions, and iv) cascade heterocyclic carbazole derivatives formation. These unique reactions were made possible in the charged microdroplet environment through our ability to program conditions such as reagent concentration (i.&#8201;e., flow rate), microdroplet reactivity (i.&#8201;e., presence or absence of plasma), and reaction timescale (i.&#8201;e., operational mode of the source). The selected program is implemented in a co&#8208;axial spray format, which is found to be advantageous over the conventional one&#8208;pot single emitter electrospray&#8208;based microdroplet reactions.

         <title>Modular Design and Scaffold&#8208;Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Functional Fluorophores for Targeted Cellular Imaging and Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach is established to synthesize multi&#8208;functional fluorophores via a scaffolding approach using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction. The characterization and applications of a small library of such probes with fluorogenic character for optical imaging and theranostics are shown. The probes can be equipped with distinct cellular localization signals and can induce programmed cell death.







Abstract
Fluorophores are essential tools for optical imaging and biomedical research. Their synthetic modification to incorporate new functions, however, remains a challenging task. Conventional strategies rely on linear synthesis in which a parent framework is gradually extended. We here designed and synthesized a versatile library of multi&#8208;functional fluorophores via a scaffold&#8208;based Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (U&#8208;4CR). The adaptability of the scaffold is achieved through modification of starting materials. This allows to use a small range of starting materials for the creation of fluorogenic probes that can detect reactive&#8208;oxygen species and where the localization into subcellular organelles or membranes can be controlled. We present reaction yields ranging from 60&#8201;% to 90&#8201;% and discovered that some compounds can even function as imaging and therapeutic agents via Fenton chemistry inducing pyroptosis in living cancer cells. Our study underlines the potential of scaffold&#8208;based synthesis for versatile creation of functional fluorophores and their applications.

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Integrated with Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic desalination device integrates CO2 electroreduction, desalination, and oxygen evolution reaction to deliver outstanding Faradaic efficiency, fast salt removal rate (SRR), and efficiency, which is also applicable in natural seawater desalination.







Abstract
Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3&#8201;% for CO production at 288&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the highest salt removal rates of 1043.49&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99&#8201;% when natural seawater is used as the water source.

         <dc:description>
Series&#8208;connected peptide nanofibers (SCPNs) were synthesized using a template&#8208;assisted strategy to trigger the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid conformational transition of peptides, thereby avoiding backbite effects and enabling continuous intermolecular reactions during the self&#8208;polymerization of peptides. SCPNs should represent a new category of peptide&#8208;based nanofibers with numerous intrinsic outstanding performances and great potential.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based nanofibers are promising materials for many essential applications and can be generalized into two categories, self&#8208;assembling peptide nanofibers (SAPNs) and poly(amino acid) nanofibers (PAANs). Non&#8208;covalent SAPNs are sequence&#8208;controllable, but poorly stable and not suitable for post&#8208;modification. While covalent PAANs are post&#8208;modifiable, however, their sequences are either monotonic or undefined. The nanofibers obtained by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail covalent coupling polymerization of sequence&#8208;known peptides, which we call series&#8208;connected peptide nanofibers (SCPNs), promise to have the advantages of both SAPNs and PAANs, but they are barely reported. The undesired backbiting effect during the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail polymerization is one of the possible challenges. Here, we present a template&#8208;assisted strategy to trigger the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid transition of peptide units, which can avoid the backbiting effect and enable consecutive intermolecular polymerization of peptides to produce desired sequence&#8208;controlled covalent SCPNs. SCPNs are highly stable and can function as excellent parent materials for various post&#8208;processing to create diverse hierarchical materials independent of the peptide sequence. Moreover, SCPNs allow for the display of predetermined functional groups at regular intervals along the nanofibers by pre&#8208;modification of the initial peptide sequence. SCPNs represent a new category of peptide&#8208;based nanofibers with outstanding performances and vast potential.

         <title>Amplifying Colossal Thermal Expansion of a Martensitic Molecular Crystal through Interlayer Shear&#8208;Induced Side&#8208;Chain Liberation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel colossal thermal expansion (TE) material, p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB, amplifies TE behavior via an irreversible &#945;&#8594;&#946; martensitic transition. The transition, accompanied by substantial interlayer shear, increases free volume surrounding TIPS side&#8208;chains, significantly enhancing their motility. This mechanism nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient in the &#946;&#8208;phase, from 255.3 to 444.9&#8197;MK&#8722;1.







Abstract
Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;&#8208;phase, the p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;&#8208;phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side&#8208;chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9&#8197;(32)&#8201;MK&#8722;1, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0&#8197;(7) to 291.7&#8197;(20)&#8201;MK&#8722;1, enabling about 4.5&#8201;% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB exhibits a decent force density (&gt;1.4&#215;107&#8197;N&#8201;m&#8722;3) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis&#8208;free and non&#8208;abrupt TE nature.

     alt="Amplifying Colossal Thermal Expansion of a Martensitic Molecular Crystal through Interlayer Shear-Induced Side-Chain Liberation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel colossal thermal expansion (TE) material, p-TIPS-DSB, amplifies TE behavior via an irreversible &#945;&#8594;&#946; martensitic transition. The transition, accompanied by substantial interlayer shear, increases free volume surrounding TIPS side-chains, significantly enhancing their motility. This mechanism nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient in the &#946;-phase, from 255.3 to 444.9&#8197;MK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p-TIPS-DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;-phase, the p-TIPS-DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;-phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side-chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9&#8197;(32)&#8201;MK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0&#8197;(7) to 291.7&#8197;(20)&#8201;MK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling about 4.5&#8201;% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p-TIPS-DSB exhibits a decent force density (&amp;gt;1.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;N&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis-free and non-abrupt TE nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated the limited operating distance of colossal TE materials can be amplified by utilizing levers, highlighting the high potential of these materials for use in micromachines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvation via Ion Dipole Interactions for Low&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;concentrated and fluorine&#8208;free ether&#8208;based electrolyte is developed to sustain lithium batteries working at high voltage and low temperature. Based on ion dipole interaction and competitive adsorption in electric double layer, the enhanced stability of electrolyte correlates with the evolution of solvation environment from bulk electrolyte to interface and the formation of antioxidant cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).







Abstract
Extending the stability of ether solvents is pivotal for developing low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium batteries. Herein, we elucidate the oxidation behavior of tetrahydrofuran with ternary BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722; and difluoro (oxalato) borate anions and the evolution of interfacial solvation environment. Combined in situ analyses and computations illustrate that the ion dipole interactions and the subsequent formation of ether&#8208;Li+&#8208;anion complexes in electrolyte rearrange the oxidation order of solvated species, which enhances the electrochemical stability of ether solvent. Furthermore, preferential absorption of anions on the surface of high&#8208;voltage cathode favors the formation of a solvent&#8208;deficient electric double layer and an anti&#8208;oxidation cathode electrolyte interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Remarkably, the formulated electrolyte based on ternary anion and tetrahydrofuran solvent endows the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode with considerable rate capability of 5.0&#8197;C and high capacity retention of 93.12&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. At a charging voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells deliver Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% at both 25 and &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Enhancing Carrier Behavior via Controlled Molecular Film Formation Engineering Leads to Significant Improvement in Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a molecular pre&#8208;stacking strategy to minimize the defect density of states during the film formation process. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DspiroO&#8208;F&#8208;TRZ, featuring a fluorophenyl group, can form uniform nano&#8208;&#8220;cluster&#8221; structures in doped films, enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the film morphology during the film formation process, thereby reducing the density of defect states and minimizing the water/oxygen traps. Consequently, an optimized carrier dynamics process ensues, culminating in a lowered barrier for carrier injection, enhanced carrier transport rate, and increased recombination probability. Remarkably, the TADF&#8208;OLED based on DspiroO&#8208;F&#8208;TRZ has exhibited substantial enhancement compared to the control device, highlighting the contribution of nano&#8208;&#8220;cluster&#8221; structure in improving electroluminescence performance.







Abstract
The quality of organic thin films critically influences carrier dynamics in organic semiconductors. In neat/doped films, even tiny voids can be penetrated by water or oxygen molecules to create charge&#8208;trap states called water/oxygen&#8208;induced traps that significantly hinder carrier mobility. While the water/oxygen&#8208;induced traps in non&#8208;doped films and crystalline states have been investigated comprehensively, there is a lack of thorough examination regarding their properties in the doped state. Therefore, there is a high demand for a molecular design strategy that effectively modulates the molecular stacking behavior in doped films and practical devices and enhances the quality of these films. Herein, we proposed a versatile molecular design principle that enables the formation of &#8220;nano&#8208;cluster&#8221; structures on both the surface and interior of doped films in target molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;spiro[acridine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] (DspiroO&#8208;F&#8208;TRZ), which is modified with a fluorophenyl group. These &#8220;nano&#8208;cluster&#8221; structures exhibit more uniform shapes within doped films and effectively reduce defective state densities while enhancing carrier injection and transport properties, ultimately improving device performance. Notably, TADF&#8208;OLED based on DspiroO&#8208;F&#8208;TRZ demonstrates nearly twice as much efficiency as its control counterpart due to contributions from &#8242;nano&#8208;cluster&#8242; structure enhancements toward improved electroluminescence performance.

         <title>Reversible Redox Probes to Determine Band&#8208;Edge Locations and Dopant Concentrations of Nano&#8208;TiO2 Thin&#8208;Films: Settling the Mott&#8208;Schottky Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We extend concepts in semiconductor electrochemistry through current&#8208;potential measurements for reversible redox active species on a thin&#8208;film nano&#8208;semiconductor electrode. In the process, we demonstrate a novel but facile methodology to determine a nano&#8208;semiconductor electrode's flatband potential, and estimate its conduction band edge position and dopant concentration.







Abstract
Knowing the exact location of the semiconductor band&#8208;edges is key for mechanistic insights into their use for water and CO2 photo/electrocatalysis. In this regard, a reliable strategy for nano&#8208;semiconductors did not exist yet. We demonstrate the use of reversible redox probes on nano&#8208;semiconductor electrodes to determine their band&#8208;edge locations in aqueous solutions. Rectifying current&#8208;potential (i&#8208;U) characteristics with the high work function (i.e. more positive formal potential) Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; redox couple yielded the exact flatband potential at various pH whereas the reversible i&#8208;U characteristics with the low work function (i.e. more negative formal potential) Ru(NH3)63+/Ru(NH3)62+ redox couple provided the conduction band&#8208;edge location and dopant concentration for a 30&#8197;nm thin&#8208;film n&#8208;TiO2. The methodology can be extended to other nano&#8208;semiconductors and serves as an alternative to and goes beyond the capabilities of the Mott&#8208;Schottky procedure for bulk semiconductor electrodes.

         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot procedural for convenient preparation of chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs). The rational screening of Cl+ and F+ as oxidation reagent allows for the enantioselective and stereospecific conversion of S(II) into chiral S(VI). The critical step includes a enantioselective hydrolysis reaction. The obtained SIFs allowed for stereospecific ligation with different types of nucleophiles and proteins.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;centered electrophilic &#8216;warheads&#8217; have emerged as key components for chemical proteomic probes through sulfur&#8208;exchange chemistry (SuFEx) with protein nucleophiles. Among these functional groups, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs) stand out for their modifiable sites, tunable electrophilicities, and chiral sulfur&#8208;center, presenting exciting possibilities for new covalent chemical probes. However, the synthetic access to chiral SIFs has been a challenge, limiting their exploration and applications. In this study, we describe a convenient route to obtain chiral SIFs from readily available sulfenamides via a series of one&#8208;pot tandem reactions with high enantiomeric excess (ees). The resulting chiral SIFs were further converted into a diverse array of chiral S(VI) derivatives under mild conditions or in buffer solutions. Most significantly, the specificity of the chiral SIFs in protein ligation experiments underscored the critical role of sulfur&#8208;center chirality in the design and screening of more&#8208;selective covalent probes and therapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;One-pot procedural for convenient preparation of chiral sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs). The rational screening of Cl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as oxidation reagent allows for the enantioselective and stereospecific conversion of S(II) into chiral S(VI). The critical step includes a enantioselective hydrolysis reaction. The obtained SIFs allowed for stereospecific ligation with different types of nucleophiles and proteins.

         <title>The Electrode/Electrolyte Interface Study during the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results from rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy suggest that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R), even in acidic electrolytes. Water molecules, rather than protons, serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. The actual reactant for CO2R is solvated CO2, also known as CO2(aq).







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (CO2R) in acidic electrolytes has gained significant attention owing to higher carbon efficiency and stability than in alkaline counterparts. However, the proton source and the role of alkali cations for CO2R are still under debate. By using rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we find that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for CO2R even in acidic electrolytes. We also confirm that water molecules, rather than protons serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Additionally, the solvated CO2, or CO2(aq), is the actual reactant for CO2R. This study provides a deeper understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface during CO2R in acidic electrolytes and sheds light on further performance improvement of this system.

         <title>Precise Single&#8208;Atom Modification of Hybrid Lead Chlorides for Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Effect and Enhanced Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;substituted hybrid lead halides with intrinsic electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) effect. The covalent bonding between the electron&#8208;withdrawing organic groups and the electron&#8208;rich lead halide units not only facilitates charge separation but also enhances structural robustness, affording excellent photocatalytic activity in aerobic oxidation.







Abstract
Hybrid lead halides show significant potential in photocatalysis due to their excellent photophysical properties, but the atomically precise modification of their organic component to achieve synergistic interactions with the lead halide units remains a great challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have employed the crystal engineering strategy to construct a class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;substituted hybrid lead halides with electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) effect. The lead halide frameworks consist of 1D linear [PbCl]+ chains as inorganic building units and benzoxadiazole/benzothiadiazole/ benzoselenadiazole&#8208;funtionalized dicarboxylates as linkers. The covalent bonding between the organic ligands with electron&#8722;withdrawing groups and the electron&#8208;rich lead halide units not only facilitate the charge separation, but also enhance structural robustness that is critical for photocatalysis. The D&#8208;A structured lead halides serve as highly efficient heterogeneous photooxidation catalysts, including aerobic oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, oxidative coupling of primary amines, oxidation of phenylboronic acids and selective oxidation of sulfides that are demonstrated in 30 examples. Importantly, these photooxidation reactions are able to be driven by natural sunlight and ambient air to afford quantitative yields. Moreover, our lead halide photocatalysts are successful to fix into a photocatalytic flow system, which enables the flow&#8208;type synthesis of high value&#8208;added photooxidation products on a gram scale.

         <title>Controlling the Mechanism of Nucleation and Growth Enables Synthesis of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Desired Macroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of UiO&#8208;66 solvothermal synthesis in presence of H2O and HCl modulators has been studied. Nucleation stage is limited with hydrolysis of Zr&#8722;Cl bonds and rate&#8208;limiting stage of crystal growth is formation of zirconium&#8208;oxo nodes. H2O accelerates and HCl inhibits both nucleation and crystal growth, however, to a different extent. The degree of deprotonation of terephthalic acid does not directly affect either nucleation or crystal growth rates.







Abstract
By combining in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that the properties of the final MOF are influenced by H2O and HCl via affecting the nucleation and crystal growth at the molecular level. The nucleation implies hydrolysis of monomeric zirconium chloride complexes into zirconium&#8208;oxo species, and this process is promoted by H2O and inhibited by HCl, allowing to control crystal size by adjusting H2O/Zr and HCl/Zr ratios. The rate&#8208;determining step of crystal growth is represented by the condensation of monomeric and oligomeric zirconium&#8208;oxo species into clusters, or nodes, with the structure identical to that in secondary building units (SBU) of UiO&#8208;66 framework. The rapid crystallization in the absence of HCl leads to formation of defective secondary building units with missing zirconium atoms, providing a pathway to control the number of defects in UiO&#8208;66 crystals. Remarkably, we have shown that assembling of the metal nodes and linkers into the UiO&#8208;66 structure is not the rate&#8208;limiting step, and the degree of deprotonation of the linker has no direct effect on the crystallization kinetics or crystal size of product.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Molecule van der Waals Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons provide opportunities for single&#8208;molecule diodes since they promise unexplored p&#8208;type doped single&#8208;molecule devices. Here, we developed a combined break junction and van der Waals heterojunction methods to fabricate boron&#8208;doped single&#8208;molecule diodes in experiments. With such a strategy, the fabricated single&#8208;molecule diode achieved a rectification ratio as high as 457 at &#177;1&#8197;V.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule diode was the first proposed device in molecular electronics. Despite the great efforts and advances over 50&#8197;years, the reported rectification ratios, the most critical parameter of a diode, remain moderate for the single&#8208;molecule diode. Herein, we report an approach to achieve a larger rectification ratio by adopting the combined strategies of p&#8208;type boron doping, the single&#8208;layer graphene nodes, and the van der Waals layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer architecture. Measured current&#8211;voltage curves showed one of the as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;molecule diodes hit an unprecedented large rectification ratio of 457 at &#177;1&#8197;V. Break junction operations and spectroscopic measurements revealed the three&#8208;atom&#8208;thick configuration of the single&#8208;molecule diodes. With the experimental and theoretical calculation results, we demonstrated the doped boron atoms induced holes to redistribute the electron density, making the asymmetric coupling at positive and negative biases, and the van der Waals interaction promoted asymmetric coupling and significantly boosted diode performance.

         <title>Second Generation Zwitterionic Aza&#8208;Diarylethene: Photoreversible CN Bond Formation, Three&#8208;State Photoswitching, Thermal Energy Release, and Facile Photoinitiation of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes is presented, which allows reversible photocontrol over all three isomeric states via photoreversible CN bond formation and E/Z photoisomerization. The high energy of the metastable states can be stored for long time while quick release is enabled by solvent polarity changes. A significantly improved capability for photoinitiation of polymerization reactions is demonstrated for materials applications.







Abstract
Diarylethenes are a well&#8208;studied and optimized class of photoswitches with a wide range of applications, including data storage, smart materials, or photocontrolled catalysis and biological processes. Most recently, aza&#8208;diarylethenes have been developed in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond connections are replaced by carbon&#8208;nitrogen connections. This structural elaboration opens up an entire new structure and property space expanding the versatility and applicability of diarylethenes. In this work, we present the second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which finally allows for fully reversible photoswitching and precise control over all three switching states. High&#8208;yielding photoswitching between the neutral open form and a zwitterionic Z isomer is achieved with two different wavelengths of light. The third zwitterionic E isomeric state can be reached in up to 87&#8201;% upon irradiation with a third wavelength. Its high energy content of &gt;10&#8197;kcal/mol can be released thermally by deliberate solvent change as trigger mechanism, rendering aza&#8208;diarylethenes into interesting candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) applications. The third state also serves as locking state, allowing to toggle light&#8208;responsiveness reversibly between thermally labile and thermally stable switching. Further, irradiation of the zwitterionic states leads to highly efficient photopolymerization of methyl acrylate (MA), directly harnessing the unleashed chemical reactivity of our aza&#8208;diarylethene in a materials application.

         <title>Chemical Synergic Stabilization of High Br&#8208;Content Mixed&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Durable Multi&#8208;Terminal Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Pb Leakage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was incorporated to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic performance and prevent the Pb leakage of high Br&#8208;content wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells via chemical synergistic interaction&#8208;assisted halide stabilization and Pb fixation. The integrated multi&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells realized efficiencies over 24&#8201;%, extended operational lifespan and Pb sequestration efficiency of over 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
High Br&#8208;content lead mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) of 1.6&#8211;2.0&#8197;eV have showcased vast potential to be used in tandem solar cells. However, WBG perovskites often suffer from severe halide segregation, phase separation and ion migration under the stress of light, heat, moisture and electric bias, which would accelerate the decomposition of perovskite films and thus deteriorate the photovoltaic performance and even aggravate the lead leakage from damaged devices. Here, we report a novel chemical synergic interaction strategy to mitigate the abovementioned issues in WBG perovskites. To achieve that, a small amount of cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, composed of multiple ammonium cations, chlorine ions and abundant hydroxyl functional groups, was introduced into WBG perovskites, which effectively stabilized the halide ions and homogenized the phase distribution, comprehensively passivated the crystallographic defects, as well as efficiently immobilized the Pb2+ ions. Encouragingly, the cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was universal and useful for different WBG perovskite compositions (i.e. 1.68&#8197;eV, 1.79&#8197;eV and 1.99&#8197;eV), which favorably boosted the efficiencies by 10&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% and extended the operational stability of resultant devices to 2680&#8197;h. The four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem and six&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells integrated with different WBG perovskite sub&#8208;cells exhibited efficiencies up to 24.39&#8201;% and 22.42&#8201;%, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrated the cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted internal chemical encapsulation effectively prevented the Pb leakage when the devices were severely damaged and immersed in water. Surprisingly, there was only 5.63 ppb Pb leaching out for the single&#8208;junction devices, far below than the U.S. standard for safe drinking water (&lt;15&#8197;ppb). The target tandem solar cells with cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modification also realized a Pb sequestration efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under the most adverse environment.

         <title>A 3D Robust and Microporous B&#8592;N Framework with 8&#8208;connected Sandwich Nodes for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of three&#8208;dimensional robust microporous B&#8592;N organic framework, BNF&#8208;100, based on dative B&#8592;N bond that is self&#8208;assembled from 8&#8208;connected electrostatic&#8208;complementary sandwich nodes [(TEPB)(BACT)2] was reported. The activated BNF&#8208;100&#8201;a achieved the purification of different branched hexane isomers by using a single breakthrough column for the first time.







Abstract
Recently B&#8592;N organic frameworks (BNFs) have gained substantial attention owing to their unique dative bond energy, which imparts them with specialized functionalities across a broad spectrum of applications. Despite previous reports on BNFs with permanent porosity, research endeavors towards three&#8208;dimensional (3D) BNFs with similar properties are scarce, with no report of robust 3D BNFs featuring permanent porosity to date. Herein, electrostatic complementary strategy is proposed to construct the first example of 3D robust and microporous BNF, BNF&#8208;100, featuring a reo topology with 8&#8208;connected sandwich nodes assembled via dative B&#8592;N bonds. The activated form BNF&#8208;100&#8201;a exhibits excellent chemical stability and permanent porosity with Langmuir surface area of 645.9&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volume of 0.23 cm3 g&#8722;1. BNF&#8208;100&#8201;a can efficiently separate hexane isomers through sieving mechanisms, as confirmed by vapor adsorption experiments and dynamic breakthrough tests, surpassing the performance of most MOF materials. Finally, we achieved the purification of different branched hexane isomers using a single breakthrough column in a combined breakthrough and purging experiment, which is the first reported instance in the literature on hexane isomer separation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Reactivity of Nitrones with Amino Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrones are used as masked precursors that can be photoisomerized to oxaziridine bioconjugation reagents in situ or separately. This approach provides access to previously unexplored N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines, which modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan and in a proteomic context tyrosine residues, thus expanding the chemical toolset for protein conjugation and proteomic profiling.







Abstract
Controlled modifications of amino acids are an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental and translational research based on peptides and proteins. Yet, we still lack methods to chemically modify each naturally occurring amino acid sidechain. To help address this gap, we show that N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines expand the scope of bioconjugation methods to chemically modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues with evidence for additional tyrosine labelling in a proteomic context. Conjugation primarily at tryptophan sites can be accessed by selective cleavage of modifications at other sidechains. The N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridine reagents are accessed through photoisomerization of nitrones, which serve as photocaged reagents, thus providing an additional level of control over reactivity. Initial guiding principles for the design of nitrone reagents are developed by exploring the impact of structure on UV/Vis absorption, photoisomerization, and reactivity. We identify a nitrone structure that maximizes photoisomerization efficiency, the aqueous stability of the oxaziridine, the extent of amino acid modification, and the stability of the resulting amino acid conjugates. We then translate nitrone reagents to modify proteins in aqueous conditions. Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage.

Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of Staffanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strained bicyclopentane (i.e. [n]staffane) backbones experience the most effective charge transport on a length&#8208;dependent basis than any other &#963;&#8208;bonded organic backbone. STM&#8208;BJ and DFT studies show this enhanced quantum transport originates from the destabilization of the HOMO&#8208;2 which aligns this orbital more closely with the Fermi energy of gold electrodes.







Abstract
We report the first conductance measurements of [n]staffane (bicyclopentane) oligomers in single&#8208;molecule junctions. Our studies reveal two quantum transport characteristics unique to staffanes that emerge from their strained bicyclic structure. First, though staffanes are composed of weakly conjugated C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds, staffanes carry a shallower conductance decay value (&#946;=0.84&#177;0.02&#8197;n&#8722;1) than alkane chain analogs (&#946;=0.96&#177;0.03&#8197;n&#8722;1) when measured with the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Staffanes are thus more conductive than other &#963;&#8208;bonded organic backbones reported in the literature on a per atom basis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest staffane backbones are more effective conduits for charge transport because their significant bicyclic ring strain destabilizes the HOMO&#8208;2 energy, aligning it more closely with the Fermi energy of gold electrodes as oligomer order increases. Second, the monostaffane is significantly lower conducting than expected. DFT calculations suggest that short monostaffanes sterically enforce insulating gauche interelectrode orientations over syn orientations; these steric effects are alleviated in longer staffanes. Moreover, we find that [2&#8208;5]staffane wires may accommodate axial mechanical strain by &#8220;rod&#8208;bending&#8221;. These findings show for the first time how bicyclic ring strain can enhance charge transmission in saturated molecular wires. These studies showcase the STM&#8208;BJ technique as a valuable tool for uncovering the stereoelectronic proclivities of molecules at material interfaces.

         <title>Quantum Spin Exchange Interactions Trigger O&#8197;p Band Broadening for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved a breakthrough in broadening the O&#8197;p band in transition metal oxides (TMOs) by harnessing quantum spin exchange interactions in Ru&#8722;MnO2 nanosheets. This induces electronic spin polarization, modulating MnO2&#8242;s spin density and broadening the O&#8197;p band. The resulting structural changes optimize proton adsorption and electron transport in zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The pressing demand for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions has propelled the development of advanced battery technologies, among which zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are prominent due to their resource abundance, high capacity, and safety in aqueous environments. However, the use of manganese oxide cathodes in ZIBs is challenged by their poor electrical conductivity and structural stability, stemming from the intrinsic properties of MnO2 and the destabilizing effects of ion intercalation. To overcome these limitations, our research delves into atomic&#8208;level engineering, emphasizing quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI). These essential for modifying electronic characteristics, can significantly influence material efficiency and functionality. We demonstrate through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that enhanced QSEI in manganese oxides broadens the O&#8197;p band, narrows the band gap, and optimizes both proton adsorption and electron transport. Empirical evidence is provided through the synthesis of Ru&#8722;MnO2 nanosheets, which display a marked increase in energy storage capacity, achieving 314.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining high capacity after 2000&#8197;cycles. Our findings underscore the potential of QSEI to enhance the performance of TMO cathodes in ZIBs, pointing to new avenues for advancing battery technology

         <title>Molecular Imaging of Renin Activity using Fluorogenic Nanoprobes for Precision Antihypertensive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) that specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter are developed. ARNs not only enable non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time profiling of renin activity through near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging, but also permit ultrasensitive detection of both plasma and urinary renin, facilitating renin&#8208;guided precision treatment and significantly improving hypertension control rate.







Abstract
Life&#8208;threatening hypertension remains inadequately controlled in clinics due to its heterogeneous renin levels. Rapid stratification of hypertension through renin analysis is crucial for effective personalized treatment, yet an ultrasensitive detection approach is currently lacking. Here, we report activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) for non&#8208;invasive and ultrasensitive profiling of renin activity and guiding antihypertensive treatment decision through near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging and in vitro urinalysis. ARNs are intrinsically non&#8208;fluorescent due to NIRF reporter connected to a gold nanocluster through a renin&#8208;responsive peptide. In hyperreninemia mouse models, ARNs specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter for accurate renin detection that outperforms the gold standard radioimmunoassay. Such specific and sensitive detection also enables imaging&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening of antihypertensive drugs. In hypertensive rat models, ARNs enable ultrasensitive detection of both plasma and urinary renin, facilitating renin&#8208;guided precision treatment and significantly improving hypertension control rate (90&#8201;% versus 58&#8201;%). Our nanoprobe platform holds great potential for assisting clinicians in rapidly and accurately classifying hypertensive patients and improving outcomes through tailored treatment selection.

         <title>Bead&#8208;Based DNA Synthesis and Sequencing for Integrated Data Storage Using Digital Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated DNA data storage pipeline is invented to streamline the whole process from DNA chemosynthesis to pyrosequencing on the surface of magnetic beads in droplets manipulated by a homemade digital microfluidic cartridge. Overall, it takes 6.5&#8197;hours to writing and reading 8&#8197;bytes of data (49&#8197;min/byte) with up to 100&#8201;% text accuracy by plural voting and RS coding.







Abstract
DNA is considered as a prospective candidate for the next&#8208;generation data storage medium, due to its high coding density, long cold&#8208;storage lifespan, and low energy consumption. Despite these advantages, challenges remain in achieving high&#8208;fidelity, fully integrated, and cost&#8208;efficient DNA storage system. In this study, a homemade digital microfluidic (DMF)&#8208;based compact DNA data storing pipeline is orchestrated to complete the entire process from the synthesis to the sequencing. The synthetic half employs phosphoramidite chemistry on 200&#8197;nm magnetic beads (MBs), where the dimethyltrityl protecting group is removed by droplet manipulation of trichloroacetic acid. The sequencing counterpart relies on pyrophosphate releasing originated from polymerase&#8208;catalyzed primer extension, which leads to photon&#8208;countable chemiluminescence (CL) signal in 2.5&#8208;&#956;L drops of trienzyme cascading reactions. Further by DNA denaturation, repeated pyrosequencing plus plurality voting can improve the nucleobase accuracy beyond 95&#8201;%. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, semantic information is saved in DNA via the Huffman coding algorithm plus the Reed&#8208;Solomon error&#8208;correction, and then robustly retrieved from this streamlined platform. As a result, it took a net total of approximately 6.5&#8197;h to writing and reading 8&#8197;bytes of data, that equal to a storaging speed of 49&#8197;min/byte, much quicker than the previously reported 2.8&#8211;4.2&#8197;h/byte. This bead&#8208;based miniaturized device promises an unattended protocol for achieving high&#8208;throughput, full&#8208;packaged, and above all, neatly precision DNA storage.

         <title>Intracellular Redox Environment Determines Cancer&#8208;normal Cell Selectivity of Selenium Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study engineers Se&#8722;Se/Se&#8722;S bond to assemble selenium (Se) nanoclusters (SeClus) with intracellular redox environment&#8208;driven selective structure. This SeClus can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32&#8722; based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells, thus exhibits high selectivity in cancer cells and normal cells.







Abstract
Elucidating the chemical structure and intracellular action mechanisms is still the critical limit for the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Intracellular redox environments originating from cell metabolism are key factors affecting internalized drug efficacy. Herein, we engineer Se&#8722;Se/Se&#8722;S bond to assemble selenium (Se) nanoclusters (SeClus) with intracellular redox environment&#8208;driven selective structure. Chemical structure analysis reveals that, the bonding of sulfur atom in intermediates to the two neighboring or interposition Se atoms in Se rings is the key internal driving force for SeClus formation. This nanocluster can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32&#8722; based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells. Resultantly, SeClus exhibit significant cell proliferation inhibition ability to cancer cells and impressive safety to normal cells. Taken together, this study not only clarifies the chemical nature of the atom engineering of SeClus, but also elucidates its intracellular redox environment&#8208;oriented anticancer mechanism.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Raman Probing of the Intrinsic Electric Field for High&#8208;Efficiency Screening of Electricity&#8208;Producing Bacteria at the Single&#8208;Cell Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method to evaluate bacterial electrochemical activity for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). By probing the intrinsic electric field (IEF) in outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes through the characteristic Raman properties of endogenous CO, we reveal a correlation between higher IEF and increased cell activity, enabling high&#8208;throughput bacterial screening.







Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;performance microbial fuel cells requires the evaluation of the activity of electrochemically active bacteria. However, this is challenging because of the time&#8208;consuming nature of biofilm formation and the invasive nature of labeling. To address this issue, we developed a fast, label&#8208;free, single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method. This method involves investigating the &#8220;pure&#8221; linear Stark effect of endogenous CO in the silent region of biological samples, which allows for probing the intrinsic electric field in the outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes of live bacterial cells. We found that reduced outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes can generate an additional intrinsic electric field equivalent to an applied potential of +0.29&#8197;V. We also found that the higher the electrical activity of the cell, the larger the generated electric field. This was also reflected in the output current of the constructed microbial fuel cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to facilitate the assessment of electrochemical activity at the single&#8208;cell level in highly&#8208;diluted bacterial samples. After analysis, inactive bacteria were ablated by laser heating, and 20 active cells were cultured for further testing. The rapid and high&#8208;throughput probing of the intrinsic electric field offers a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency screening of electrochemically active bacterial cells for bioenergetic and photosynthetic research.

         <title>Inner Side Chain Modification of Small Molecule Acceptors Enables Lower Energy Loss and High Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Processed with Non&#8208;halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two small molecule acceptors (SMAs) L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;PhMe were synthesized. The L8&#8208;PhMe possesses more effective non&#8208;covalent interactions and ordered molecular packing than that of L8&#8208;PhF. While, superior morphology and reduced energy loss were also obtained in L8&#8208;PhMe&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs). This study highlights that the energy loss of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents could be decreased through regulating the intermolecular interactions of SMAs by inner side chain modification.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents usually suffer from excessive self&#8208;aggregation of small molecule acceptors (SMAs), severe phase separation and higher energy loss (Eloss), leading to reduced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Regulating the intermolecular interaction to disperse the aggregation and further improve the molecular packing order of SMAs would be an effective strategy to solve this problem. Here, we designed and synthesized two SMAs L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;PhMe by introducing different substituents (fluorine for L8&#8208;PhF and methyl for L8&#8208;PhMe) on the phenyl end group of the inner side chains of L8&#8208;Ph, and investigated the effect of the substituents on the intermolecular interaction of SMAs, Eloss and performance of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Through single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations, it is found that compared with L8&#8208;PhF, which possesses strong and abundant intermolecular interactions but downgraded molecular packing order, L8&#8208;PhMe with the methyl substituent possesses more effective non&#8208;covalent interactions, which improves the tightness and order of molecular packing. When blending the SMAs with polymer donor PM6, the differences in intermolecular interactions of the SMAs influenced the film formation process and phase separation of the blend films. The L8&#8208;PhMe based blend film exhibits shorten film formation and more homogeneous phase separation than those of the L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;Ph based ones. Especially, the OSCs based on L8&#8208;PhMe show reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss and enhanced Voc than the devices based on the other two SMAs. Consequently, the L8&#8208;PhMe based device processed with o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) and using 2PACz as the hole transport layer (HTL) shows an outstanding PCE of 19.27&#8201;%. This study highlights that the Eloss of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents could be decreased through regulating the intermolecular interactions of SMAs by inner side chain modification, and also emphasize the importance of effectivity rather than intensity of non&#8208;covalent interactions introduced in SMAs on the molecular packing, morphology and PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Enhancement of NIR&#8208;II Emission of Er3+ by Doping Fe3+ in Double Perovskites: Multimode Luminescence for Versatile Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe3+,Er3+ co&#8208;doped double perovskite material has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including highly efficient NIR luminescence and multimode controllable luminescence. These findings highlight the immense potential in versatile photoelectric applications including optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and NIR imaging, and provide valuable insights into the modification of luminescent properties by doping transition metal ions.







Abstract
Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near&#8208;infrared range. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency multimode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f&#8208;4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multimode luminescence and enhance the second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue&#8208;excitable (450&#8197;nm) NIR&#8208;II emission around 1541&#8197;nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7&#8197;times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 22.5&#8201;%. This enhancement enables innovative applications such as two&#8208;dimensional information encryption by the multi&#8208;channel cooperative responses and improved NIR imaging. The study highlights the potential of Fe3+ doping in optimizing absorption and multimode luminescence in perovskites, opening avenues for advanced applications in blue&#8208;excitable NIR light emitting diodes (LEDs), thermometer, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and NIR imaging.

Detailed information is obtained for the reversible H+&#8208;transfer interconverting reactive &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxodicopper(II) and &#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxodicopper(II) species, including the structural characterization of H&#8208;bond donor adducts and a DFT mapping of the correlated H+&#8208;transfer and &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8594;&#956;1,1&#8208;peroxo rearrangement. This establishes a mechanistic basis for a key component of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactivity involving biorelevant Cu2/O2 intermediates.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds involving the oxygen atoms of intermediates that result from copper&#8208;mediated O2 activation play a key role for controlling the reactivity of Cux/O2 active sites in metalloenzymes and synthetic model complexes. However, structural insight into H&#8208;bonding in such transient species as well as thermodynamic information about proton transfer to or from the O2&#8208;derived ligands is scarce. Here we present a detailed study of the reversible interconversion of a &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxodicopper(II) complex ([1]+) and its &#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo congener ([2]+) via (de)protonation, including the isolation and structural characterization of several H&#8208;bond donor (HBD) adducts of [1]+ and the determination of binding constants. For one of these adducts a temperature&#8208;dependent &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo/&#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo equilibrium associated with reversible H+&#8208;translocation is observed, its thermodynamics investigated experimentally and computationally, and effects of H&#8208;bonding on spectroscopic parameters of the CuII2(&#956;1,2&#8208;O2) species are revealed. DFT calculations allowed to fully map and correlate the trajectories of H+&#8208;transfer and &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8594;&#956;1,1&#8208;peroxo rearrangement. These findings enhance our understanding of two key intermediates in bioinspired Cu2/O2 chemistry.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MoO3 by Surface Oxidation of Mo2C (MXene) for Stable Near&#8208;Surface Reactions in Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of MoO3 and Mo2C was achieved by in situ growing MoO3 on the interlayer and surface of Mo2C MXene. Through depth profiling, a unique near&#8208;surface reaction was found, which enabled Mo2C to provide a durable conductive skeleton and ion diffusion channel for MoO3, making Mo2C/MoO3 composites exhibit excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5&#8197;mAh/g for 200&#8197;cycles). The mechanism of H+/Al3+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction was studied. The first&#8208;principle calculation showed that Mo2C improved the MoO3 reaction kinetics. As a result, Mo2C/MoO3 batteries have higher specific capacity and stability. This work provides insights for improving the AAIBs cathode and expanding the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in water&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a promising positive electrode material for aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity. However, MoO3 faces several challenges in an aqueous electrolyte, such as easy dissolution of reaction products, volume expansion, and low conductivity, which severely limit its application in aqueous batteries. In this work, we effectively increased the overall conductivity of the electrode by in situ growing MoO3 on the Mo2C MXene layer. MXene can effectively inhibit the dissolution and structural loss of MoO3 reaction products. Additionally, the coordination effect of Mo2C and MoO3 achieves a stable near&#8208;surface reaction on the MXene laminates, resulting in the Mo2C/MoO3 composite exhibiting excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5&#8197;mAh/g after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.4&#8197;A/g). The energy storage mechanism of H+/Al3+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction was elucidated through ex situ characterization, and the promotion effect of Mo2C on MoO3 reaction kinetics was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides new insights into improving the stability of AAIBs cathodes and extends the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in aqueous batteries.

         <title>Synthesis and Anisotropic Memristive Behavior of Borophene Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline borophene nanosheets were successfully synthesized on an aluminum foil substrate, exhibiting two characteristic borophene structures: &#946;12&#8208;borophene and &#945;&#8216;&#8208;4H&#8208;borophene. The anisotropic memory behavior of quasi&#8208;continuous borophene nanosheet films has been observed, which is characterized by volatile memory in the vertical direction and non&#8208;volatile memory in the horizontal direction.







Abstract
Neuromorphic computing, marked by its parallel computational abilities and low power usage, has become pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence. However, the advancement of neuromorphic computing has faced significant obstacles due to the performance limitations of traditional memory devices struggling with high power consumption and limited reliability. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively investigated as high&#8208;performance memristive materials, but they are often restricted by fixed memristive properties, which complicate circuit design and limit flexibility. Here, we report that multilayer borophene nanosheets represent a breakthrough material, displaying anisotropic variable memristive properties. The nanosheets, comprising semiconductor &#945;&#8217;&#8208;4H&#8208;borophene sheets and metal &#946;12&#8208;borophene sheets, have been synthesized on aluminum foil surface through chemical vapor deposition method. The multilayer borophene nanosheets exhibit volatile memory behavior in the vertical direction and non&#8208;volatile memory behavior in the planar direction. This innovative class of 2D nanosheets not only overcomes the limitations of conventional memory devices but also expands the potential applications of borophene&#8208;based memories in information storage and in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of 2,6&#8208;Diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octanes by Harnessing the Potential of an 3&#8208;Oxindolium Ion Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under organocatalytic circumstances, the enantioselective synthesis of polycyclic 2,6&#8208;diazabycyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6&#8208;DABCO) units with a sensitive bridged aminal junction has been achieved. This one&#8208;pot domino process generates unique 3&#8208;oxindolium ion in situ and is found to be essential for the challenging double aza&#8208;cyclizations.







Abstract
Due to its structural complexity and intrinsic sensitivity of bridged aminal junction, 2,6&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6&#8208;DABCO) has remained a highly desirable target in synthetic chemistry. However, the asymmetric access to this unit is still insufficient and hampered by the need for meticulously created functionalities for intricate double aza&#8208;cyclizations.

&lt;p&gt;Under organocatalytic circumstances, the enantioselective synthesis of polycyclic 2,6-diazabycyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6-DABCO) units with a sensitive bridged aminal junction has been achieved. This one-pot domino process generates unique 3-oxindolium ion in situ and is found to be essential for the challenging double aza-cyclizations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its structural complexity and intrinsic sensitivity of bridged aminal junction, 2,6-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6-DABCO) has remained a highly desirable target in synthetic chemistry. However, the asymmetric access to this unit is still insufficient and hampered by the need for meticulously created functionalities for intricate double aza-cyclizations. Herein, we have developed a novel enantio- and diastereoselective protocol to access polycyclic chiral 2,6-DABCOs under metal-free conditions. This domino process involves the amine-catalyzed [4+2] annulation between glutaraldehyde and 2-arylindol-3-ones, followed by an acid-mediated Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction/intramolecular aza-cyclization cascade sequence with tryptamine by trapping of in situ generated 3-oxindolium ion intermediate for the first time. Overall, 2,6-DABCOs fused with medicinally relevant scaffolds were isolated with good yield and excellent stereoselectivity by constructing five new bonds and four stereocenters in a one-pot operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Interfacial Assembly: Integrating Supramolecular Hosts into Polymeric Membranes through an Aqueous Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable membrane fabrication method, supramolecular interfacial assembly (SIA), has been developed to produce composite polymeric membranes integrated with macrocycles. By leveraging the quasi&#8208;liquid character of a concentrated polymer solution, SIA ensures the homogeneous spreading of macrocycle aqueous solution on its surface, creating an interface between &#8220;water/water&#8221; phases. A cross&#8208;linked composite membrane can be subsequently formed through supramolecular electrostatic interactions between the anionic polymer and cationic macrocycles. This organic solvent&#8208;free method, employing biomass&#8208;derived sodium alginate polymer, distinguishes itself from traditional interfacial polymerization by its environmental friendliness and controllability. Moreover, the resulting composite membrane showcases precise molecular sieving performance in organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN).







Abstract
Efficient incorporation of macrocycles in polymeric membranes can impart the overall matrix with new properties for a range of cutting&#8208;edge applications. Here, we introduce a Supramolecular Interfacial Assembly (SIA) method for the fabrication of polymeric membranes featuring embedded macrocycles. Through harnessing the quasi&#8208;liquid nature of the concentrated polymer solution, SIA orchestrates the homogeneous spreading of macrocycles in an aqueous layer on its surface, leading to the creation of an interface between &#8220;water/water&#8221; phases, subsequently forming a cross&#8208;linked membrane driven by supramolecular electrostatic interactions. Remarkably, compared to the traditional interfacial polymerization, SIA adheres to a &#8220;green&#8221; paradigm without the need for organic solvents. The resultant composite membrane exhibits superior performance in organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), owing to the precise molecular sieving property provided by the macrocycles with well&#8208;defined permanent cavities. This fabrication method holds great promise for the innovative design and production of composite membranes that seamlessly integrates macrocycles with conventional polymers, which can greatly impact the design and preparation of advanced membrane materials in the future.

         <title>Planar Pentacoordinate Halogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar pentacoordinate halogens present a challenge in chemistry, especially due to the electronegativity and restricted delocalization associated with halogens. Through extensive computational analysis, we identify a starlike D5h&#8208;symmetry global minimum structure in Li5X6&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br) clusters, where the halogen is centrally positioned in a Li5X5 crown. Stability arises from electrostatic interactions, complemented by weak covalent dative bonding.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordinate motifs represent an intriguing frontier in chemistry, challenging traditional bonding norms. As electronegativity of the central atom increases, achieving planar hypercoordination becomes more difficult due to restricted delocalization, making the design of planar hypercoordinate halogens particularly puzzling. Here, we conduct an extensive computational survey of LinXn+1&#8722; (n=4, 5, 6; X=F, Cl, Br, I) clusters, revealing a starlike D5h&#8208;symmetry global minimum in Li5X6&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br) with a planar pentacoordinate halogen (ppX), where X&#8722; is located at the center of Li5X5 crown. The clusters are stabilized predominantly through electrostatic interactions between X&#8722; and Li5X5, complemented by weak covalent bonding from dative interaction. Due to the weak orbital overlap, ppX clusters exhibit localized diatropic ring currents around X and Li.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Formate Ester Transfer Hydrogenation Enables an Electrochemical/Thermal Organometallic Cascade for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development and mechanistic understanding of room&#8208;temperature transfer hydrogenation unlocks a multicatalyst cascade reaction strategy for the CO2 reduction to MeOH combining electrochemical and organometallic catalysis in the same reactor.







Abstract
The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy&#8208;dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low&#8208;temperature and low&#8208;pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H&#8208;PNP)Ir(H)3 (H&#8208;PNP=HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room&#8208;temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a prototype for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that will guide the design and development of multicatalyst cascades.

         <title>Lantern&#8208;Shaped Structure Induced by Racemic Ligands in Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Metal Halide with Near 100&#8201;% Quantum Yield and Multiple&#8208;Stimulus Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing the synergistic effect of racemic ligands, a novel red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide with lantern&#8208;shaped hybrid structures was developed, exhibiting nearly 100&#8201;% quantum yield and unique stimulus&#8208;responsive color switching under the dual stimulation of heat and mechanical force.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their excellent luminescent properties and tunable emission wavelengths. However, the development of efficient red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting OIMHs remains a significant challenge. This work reports three Mn&#8208;based OIMHs derived from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrobromide: racemic one (Rac&#8208;TBM) and chiral ones (R&#8208;TBM and S&#8208;TBM). As a result of the synergism of chiral organic ligands inducing a unique lantern&#8208;shaped hybrid structure containing both tetrahedra and octahedra, Rac&#8208;TBM exhibits red&#8208;light emission with near&#8208;unity luminescence quantum yield. In comparison, the chiral counterparts R/S&#8208;TBM display strong green emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum value up to &#177;2.5&#215;10&#8722;2. Interestingly, a mixture of R&#8208; and S&#8208;TBM can transform into Rac&#8208;TBM, successfully achieving a sensitive and reversible switch between red light of octahedra and green light of tetrahedra under external stimuli. The outstanding luminescent properties allow Rac&#8208;TBM to be utilized not only for X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a detection limit down to 46.29&#8197;nGys&#8722;1, but also for advanced information encryption systems to achieve leak&#8208;proof decryption.

&lt;p&gt;Organic-inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their excellent luminescent properties and tunable emission wavelengths. However, the development of efficient red-light-emitting OIMHs remains a significant challenge. This work reports three Mn-based OIMHs derived from 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrobromide: racemic one (&lt;i&gt;Rac&lt;/i&gt;-TBM) and chiral ones (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-TBM and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-TBM). As a result of the synergism of chiral organic ligands inducing a unique lantern-shaped hybrid structure containing both tetrahedra and octahedra, &lt;i&gt;Rac&lt;/i&gt;-TBM exhibits red-light emission with near-unity luminescence quantum yield. In comparison, the chiral counterparts &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-TBM display strong green emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a &lt;i&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; value up to &#177;2.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Interestingly, a mixture of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-TBM can transform into &lt;i&gt;Rac&lt;/i&gt;-TBM, successfully achieving a sensitive and reversible switch between red light of octahedra and green light of tetrahedra under external stimuli. The outstanding luminescent properties allow &lt;i&gt;Rac&lt;/i&gt;-TBM to be utilized not only for X-ray radioluminescence with a detection limit down to 46.29&#8197;nGys&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, but also for advanced information encryption systems to achieve leak-proof decryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Silver Clusters from Ag57 to Ag72 via Laminating Multiple Different Anion Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike previous approaches that employed single or double hetero&#8208;anion templates, the current research introduces a groundbreaking strategy using multiple distinct types of anion templates with varying sizes, geometries, and charge states. By deliberately introducing a third SO42&#8722; anion template to a hetero&#8208;anion (Cl&#8722; and lacunary [SiW9O34]10&#8722;) templated system, a pioneering example of longitudinal epitaxial growth from Ag57 to Ag72 has been realized. These findings underscore the significance of multiple anion&#8208;template strategy in advancing high&#8208;nuclearity silver clusters.







Abstract
The established capability of anion templates in precisely manipulating the size, geometry, and function of metal clusters is well acknowledged. However, the development of a systematic methodology for orchestrating the assembly of silver clusters, particularly those encompassing multiple distinct types of anion templates, remains elusive due to the formidable synthetic challenge. In this work, we report two novel silver clusters, Ag57 and Ag72, using two and three different anion templates, respectively. Ag57 features a gyroscope&#8208;like monovalent cation with an Ag3 triangle core sandwiched by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722; and a triad of Cl&#8722; anion templates. By intentionally introducing the third anion template, SO42&#8722;, the structure is expanded to the unprecedented Ag72 (with 15&#8197;silver atoms epitaxially grown on top of Ag57) resembling a tumbler, inside of which two Ag3 layers are laminated by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722;, seven Cl&#8722; and one SO42&#8722; anion templates in parallel with respect to longitudinal orientation. It is noteworthy that Ag72 exhibits remarkable structural complexity and represents a pioneering achievement as the first silver cluster incorporating three distinct types of anion templates. In addition, Ag72 demonstrates a significant advantage over Ag57, particular in terms of applications such as luminescent thermometers and remote laser ignition. This work not only broadens the horizon for precise control of the silver cluster structures through the integration of multiple types of hetero&#8208;anions but also lays a solid foundation for potential optical applications in the future.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Separation of Integratively Self&#8208;Sorted Pd2LA2LB2 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two shape&#8208;complementary ligands coordinate with Pd(II) to form either heteroleptic or homoleptic cage species. The equilibrium of the products can be controlled by choosing DMSO or MeCN as a solvent. Joint experimental and theoretical analyses elucidate the driving force behind this separation.







Abstract
The integrative implementation of multiple different components into metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assemblies requires sophisticated strategies to avoid the formation of statistical mixtures. Previously, the key focus was set on thermodynamically driven reactions of simple homoleptic into complex heteroleptic structures. Using Pd2LA2LB2&#8208;type coordination cages, we herein show that integrative self&#8208;sorting can be reversed by a change of solvent (from DMSO to MeCN) to favor narcissistic re&#8208;segregation into coexisting homoleptic species Pd2LA4 and Pd3LB6. Full separation (&#8220;unsorting&#8221;) back to a mixture of the homoleptic precursors was finally achieved by selective precipitation of Pd3LB6 with anionic guest G1 from MeCN, keeping pure Pd2LA4 in solution. When a mixture of homoleptic Pd3LB6 and heteroleptic Pd2LA2LB2 is exposed to a combination of two different di&#8208;anions (G1 and G2) in DMSO, selective guest uptake gives rise to two defined coexisting host&#8211;guest complexes. A joint experimental and deep theoretical investigation via liquid&#8208;state integral equation theory of the reaction thermodynamics on a molecular level accompanied by solvent distribution analysis hints at solvent expulsion from Pd2LA4 to favor the formation of Pd2LA2LB2 in DMSO as the key entropic factor for determining the solvent&#8208;specific modulation of the cage conversion equilibrium.

         <title>Development of DuoMYC: a synthetic cell penetrant miniprotein that efficiently inhibits the oncogenic transcription factor MYC</title>

The &#8216;undruggable&#8217; transcription factor MYC is implicated in numerous human cancers, and its targeting is a long standing challenge in drug development. Here, we report the development of &#8216;DuoMYC&#8217;, a synthetic miniprotein able efficiently inhibit MYC driven transcription.







Abstract
The master regulator transcription factor MYC is implicated in numerous human cancers, and its targeting is a long&#8208;standing challenge in drug development. MYC is a typical &#8216;undruggable&#8217; target, with no binding pockets on its DNA binding domain and extensive intrinsically disordered regions. Rather than trying to target MYC directly with classical modalities, here we engineer synthetic miniproteins that can bind to MYC's target DNA, the enhancer box (E&#8208;Box), and potently inhibit MYC&#8208;driven transcription. We crafted the miniproteins via structure&#8208;based design and a combination of solid phase peptide synthesis and site&#8208;specific crosslinking. Our lead variant, DuoMYC, binds to E&#8208;Box DNA with high affinity (KD ~0.1&#8197;&#956;M) and is able to enter cells and inhibit MYC&#8208;driven transcription with submicromolar potency (IC50=464&#8197;nM) as shown by reporter gene assay and confirmed by RNA sequencing. Notably, DuoMYC surpasses the efficacy of several other recently developed MYC inhibitors. Our results highlight the potential of engineered synthetic protein therapeutics for addressing challenging intracellular targets.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and copper cooperatively catalyzed remote enantioselective &#1013;&#8208;alkylation strategy is reported, enabling highly efficient synthesis of unique tetrasubstituted allene scaffolds with precise control of continuous central and axial chirality. Mechanistic studies suggest a cooperative activation mode and synergistical control of distal chirality created from the copper ethynylallenylidenes.







Abstract
Chiral tetrasubstituted allenes have emerged as important architectures for engineering biologically active compounds. The construction of unique tetrasubstituted allene scaffolds with precise control of continuous central and axial chirality remains yet to be developed. Here, we report a remote enantioselective &#1013;&#8208;alkylation of yne&#8208;propargylic acetates with enals enabled by NHC and copper cooperative catalysis, leading to a series of tetrasubstituted allenes with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr). This method features high regioselectivity and simultaneous control of axial and central chirality. Mechanistic studies suggest a cooperative activation mode and synergistic control of distal chirality created from the copper ethynylallenylidenes.

         <title>Coupling Rotary Motion to Helicene Inversion within a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;powered molecular motor featuring a specifically engineered helicene moiety is presented. The inversion of the helicene fragment is mechanically coupled to the unidirectional rotation of the motor in a 6&#8208;step rotation cycle, which involves 8 isomers. This coupled motion results in the dynamic modulation of the handedness of the helicene by the motor via a central to helical to helical chiral transmission mechanism.







Abstract
Towards complex coupled molecular motions, the remote handedness inversion of a helicene moiety was achieved by a rotary molecular motor. The use of a specifically engineered dynamic helicene stator in a novel overcrowded&#8208;alkene second&#8208;generation molecular motor based on a fluorinated dibenzofluorene fragment allows for an unprecedented control over helicity inversion. This is achieved by the mechanical coupling of the rotation of the rotor to the helicene inversion of the stator half via a remote chirality transmission process. Thus, the unidirectional rotary motion generated upon irradiation is used to invert the dynamic stereochemistry of a helicene, leading to a 6&#8208;step cycle with eight intermediates. In this cycle, both alternation between P and M configurations of the helicene stator and dynamic thermal interconversion (paddling motion) can be achieved. In&#8208;depth computational and spectroscopic studies were performed to support the associated mechanism. The control over coupled motion and dynamic helicity offers prospects for the development of complex responsive systems.

         <title>Bulky Phosphazenium Salt Controlling Chemoselective Terpolymerization of Epoxide, Anhydride and CO2: From Well&#8208;Defined Block to Truly Random Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(ester&#8211;carbonate) copolymers from well&#8208;defined block to truly random sequences were readily synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions via chemoselective terpolymerization of CO2, epoxide and anhydride by simply adjusting the molar ratio of P5Cl/TEB.







Abstract
Copolymers with precise compositions and controlled sequences are great appealing for high&#8208;performance polymeric materials, but their synthesis is very challenging. In this study, tetrakis[tris(dimethylamino)phosphoranylidenamino] phosphonium chloride (P5Cl) and triethylboron (TEB) were chosen as the binary catalyst to synthesize both well&#8208;defined block and truly random poly(ester&#8211;carbonate) copolymers via the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step terpolymerization of epoxide/anhydride/CO2 under metal&#8208;free conditions. The bulky nature of phosphazenium cation not only led to loose cation&#8211;anion pairs and enhanced the reactivity, but also provided the chain&#8208;end an appropriate protection and improved the controllability. In particular, P5Cl/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 showed an extraordinary chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CHO/CO2. Thus, well&#8208;defined block polyester&#8211;polycarbonate copolymers were synthesized by CHO/PA/CO2 terpolymerization. The chemoselectivity was easily tuned and the ROAC of CHO/PA and ROAC of CHO/CO2 occurred simultaneously with P5Cl/TEB=1/2, producing truly random poly(ester&#8211;carbonate) copolymers from CHO/PA/CO2. In addition, this P5Cl/TEB catalyst and the strategy to regulate its chemoselectivity are versatile for various anhydrides, epoxides and initiators. Thus, poly(ester&#8211;carbonate) copolymers with varying sequences, compositions, and topologies are successfully synthesized, making it possible to compare their properties and to expand their applications.

         <title>Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (CROPISA) of 2&#8208;Oxazolines: From Block Copolymers to One&#8208;Step Gradient Copolymer Nanoparticles</title>

This study introduces a novel method for creating poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) nanoparticles via cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (CROPISA) in n&#8208;dodecane. By chain&#8208;extending poly(2&#8208;(3&#8208;ethylheptyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) with poly(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), unique nanoparticles with diverse morphologies were synthesized. Additionally, a single&#8208;step gradient CROPISA process was developed, enabling a streamlined synthesis of new formulations.







Abstract
In recent years, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has emerged as a powerful method for the straightforward synthesis of polymer nanoparticles at high concentration. In this study, we describe for the first time the synthesis of poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) nanoparticles by dispersion cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (CROPISA) in n&#8208;dodecane. Specifically, a n&#8208;dodecane&#8208;soluble aliphatic poly(2&#8208;(3&#8208;ethylheptyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEHOx) block was chain&#8208;extended with poly(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PPhOx). While the PhOx monomer is soluble in n&#8208;dodecane, its polymerization leads to n&#8208;dodecane&#8208;insoluble PPhOx, which leads to in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly of the formed PEHOx&#8208;b&#8208;PPhOx copolymers. The polymerization kinetics and micellization upon second block formation were studied, and diverse nanoparticle dispersions were prepared, featuring varying block lengths and polymer concentrations, leading to dispersions with distinctive morphologies and physical properties. Finally, we developed a single&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of polymer nanoparticles directly from monomers via gradient copolymerization CROPISA, which exploits the significantly greater reactivity of EHOx compared to that of PhOx during the statistical copolymerization of both monomers. Notably, this approach provides access to formulations with monomer compositions otherwise unattainable through the block copolymerization method. Given the synthetic versatility and application potential of poly(2&#8208;oxazolines), the developed CROPISA method can pave the way for advanced nanomaterials with favorable properties as demonstrated by using the obtained nanoparticles for stabilization of Pickering emulsions.

A bioorthogonal photoclick&#8208;release method is exploited based on 405&#8197;nm light&#8208;induced cycloaddition between BiSyd and 2&#8208;ArNH2&#8208;NQ to give BIZON7 in situ as a photo&#8208;pharmacophore while uncaging naphthalimide&#8208;6&#8208;amine for fluorogenic imaging. This method is applied to &#955;&#8208;gated theranostics with tracking and photodynamic therapy on designated cells targeting mitochondria.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click&#8208;release chemistry is a cutting&#8208;edge tool for exploring and manipulating biomolecule functions in native biological systems. However, it is challenging to achieve the precise regulation or therapy of individual cells via click&#8208;release strategies driven by proximity and thermodynamics. Herein, we propose a novel photoclick&#8208;release approach based on a photo&#8208;induced cycloaddition between 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;arylsydnone) or C&#8208;bithienyl&#8208;diarylsydnone and 2&#8208;arylamino&#8208;naphthoquinone via irradiation with 405 or 485&#8197;nm light. It constructs 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[f]indazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione (BIZON) as a pharmacophore while releases an arylamine for fluorescence turn&#8208;on probing. Both photoclick reagents were tailored by connecting to the triphenyl phosphonium delivery motif for enrichment in the mitochondria of live cells. This enables an intracellular photoclick and release under the control of 405 or 485&#8197;nm light. We then discovered that the in situ photo&#8208;generated BIZON is capable of photosensitizing upon 485 or 520&#8197;nm light to produce singlet oxygen inside the mitochondria under aerobic conditions. Therefore, we realized wash&#8208;free fluorescence tracking and subsequent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at single&#8208;cell resolution using global illumination, which provides a foundation for wavelength&#8208;gated single&#8208;cell theranostics.

&lt;p&gt;A bioorthogonal photoclick-release method is exploited based on 405&#8197;nm light-induced cycloaddition between BiSyd and 2-ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NQ to give &lt;b&gt;BIZON7&lt;/b&gt; in situ as a photo-pharmacophore while uncaging naphthalimide-6-amine for fluorogenic imaging.

An exploration of 1,2&#8208;dihydroazetes in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is reported. The 4&#8208;membered rings readily polymerized using the Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 2nd generation initiator and maintained living chain&#8208;ends for block polymer synthesis. This study gives new insights into the reactivity and limitations of enamine derivatives in metathesis processes, while also offering a new approach to degradable metathesis materials with tunable properties.ROMP1,2&#8208;DihydroazeteDegradationRegio&#8208;selectivity







Abstract
Fischer carbenes have recently found great utility in the construction of degradable metathesis materials, but investigations have been limited to oxygen&#8208;containing enol ether monomers. Here, the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dihydroazetes is reported. The polymerization proceeds regioselectively, and the resulting molecular weights are targetable by adjusting the Grubbs initiator loading. Under acidic conditions, the resulting polymers degrade into 3&#8208;aminopropanal derivatives through hydrolysis of the recurring enamide motifs in the polymer backbone. Additionally, the underlying kinetics and thermodynamics of the polymerization were studied through DFT calculations to elucidate the origins of metathesis regioselectivity. This work further expands the suite of monomers available to generate degradable metathesis materials and provides a flexible platform for target applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate three&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;flower electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance in the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Fe incorporation regulating the electronic structure, breaking the Co&#8722;O&#8722;Co equilibrium and causing size mismatch, both AEM and LOPM pathways simultaneously occurred on CFMO&#8208;2, where the AEM pathway takes place at Co sites without adjacent Fe and the LOPM pathway takes place at Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bimetallic sites.







Abstract
The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8722;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000&#8197;h of operation in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65&#8197;V to deliver 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Metal&#8208;Ion Selectivity Induced by Intramolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Precise Heterometallic Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic architectures usually fail to assemble in a one&#8208;pot method with only one type of organic motif due to its low metal&#8208;ion selectivity. An effective intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; strategy has new be utilized for the successful and precise construction of the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34 by the one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions with a tritopic terpyridyl ligand L3, which encodes the definite metal ion sequence.







Abstract
Heterometallic supramolecules, known for their unique synergistic effects, have shown broad applications in photochemistry, host&#8208;guest chemistry, and catalysis. However, there are great challenges to precisely construct heterometallic supramolecules rather than a statistical mixture, due to the limited metal&#8208;ion selectivity of coordination units. In particular, heterometallic architectures precisely encoded with different metal ions usually fail to form in a one&#8208;pot method when only one type of coordinated motif exists due to its poor metal&#8208;ion selectivity. Herein, we propose an effective intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; (IC&#960;) strategy and successfully constructed the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34 by the one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of tritopic terpyridyl ligand L3 with Zn(II) and Cu(II), following a clear self&#8208;assembly mechanism in which only thermodynamic dimers ZnL12 and Cu2L22 were constructed with model ligands L1, L2, Zn(II) and Cu(II) with perfect self&#8208;sorting and an ultra&#8208;high metal&#8208;selectivity feature. The successful construction of the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34, in which the definite sequence of metal ions Zn(II) and Cu(II) is encoded in the one&#8208;pot method, will offer a novel approach to precisely construct heterometallic architectures.

By hybridized long&#8208;short axis strategy, TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a rapid RISC rate of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, narrow FWHM of 23&#8197;nm, and small &#916;EST of 0.06&#8197;eV. The OLED without sensitizer exhibits a narrowband green emission with the FWHM of 31&#8197;nm, EQEmax of 37.9&#8201;%, and low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain a high level of 34.8&#8201;% and 21.8&#8201;% at 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules have experienced great success in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their outstanding quantum efficiencies and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs). However, the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, which will lead to relatively long triplet exciton lifetime and severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, we report an effective molecular design strategy to introduce multichannel RISC pathways and thus increase RISC rates without compromising the color fidelity and emission efficiency by the &#8220;hybridized long&#8208;short axis (HLSA)&#8221; strategy. The TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, rapid RISC rate of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, narrow FWHM of 23&#8197;nm, and small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.06&#8197;eV in solution. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED based on TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN exhibits a narrowband emission with the FWHM of 31&#8197;nm, in company with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.9&#8201;%. Notably, the device exhibits the low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain 34.8&#8201;% and 21.8&#8201;% at 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best performance for single&#8208;host OLEDs based on the BCzBN skeleton. This study provides a fresh and promising approach to realize high&#8208;performance OLEDs with high color purity and remarkable device efficiency.

         <title>Acene&#8208;Integrated Buckybowls with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption and over 90&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two molecular buckybowls, composed of two rows of tetracenes and pentacenes fused through s&#8208;indacene unit at the zigzag edges, have been synthesized and characterized. The acene&#8208;integrated buckybowls exhibit high stability, narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, a broad absorption that reaches into near&#8208;infrared II region, which have an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency over 90&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser photo&#8208;irradiation.







Abstract
Tetracene and pentacene are large, promising building blocks for construction of complex molecular nanocarbons due to their extraordinary photophysical and electronic properties. Herein, two acene&#8208;integrated buckybowls, composed of two rows of tetracenes and pentacenes fused through s&#8208;indacene unit at the zigzag edges, have been synthesized and characterized. Compared to parent tetracene and pentacene, the buckybowls are extremely stable and show much smaller electrochemical band gaps. Kinetic studies gave the bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion barriers of 11.7 and 13.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Subsequent investigations on magnetic ring currents revealed two local diatropic currents at two rows of acenes and one paratropic current at the s&#8208;indacene unit, respectively. Notably, both buckybowls show a broad absorption that reaches into near&#8208;infrared II region, and a high photothermal conversion efficiency (&gt;90&#8201;%) was achieved when exposed to near&#8208;infrared 1064&#8197;nm laser photo&#8208;irradiation. This study highlights the unusual nature of merging the intrinsic properties of acenes with the inherent properties of buckybowls and showcases a potential avenue for acene utilization for the design of novel complex nanocarbons with a broad range of applications.

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Solid Polymer Electrolytes Enabling an Ultra&#8208;Stable Interface with Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi ZIF&#8208;67, rich in open metal sites, is synthesized through controlled pyrolysis and utilized as solid fillers for solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Studies show that quasi ZIF&#8208;67 in SPE can effectively immobilize TFSI&#8722;, facilitate Li+ migration, and catalyze TFSI&#8722; decomposition. Therefore, an ultra&#8208;stable Li|SPE interface is achieved, leading to exceptional long&#8208;term battery cycling performance.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are crucial in the development of lithium metal batteries. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMSs) have shown promise as solid fillers to improve the performance of SPEs. However, the number of OMS&#8208;containing MOFs is quite limited, comprising less than 5% of the total MOFs. When considering yield, cost, and processability, the commonly used OMS&#8208;containing MOFs are no more than 10&#8197;types, causing great limitations. Herein, we reported a simple and universal methodology that converted OMS&#8208;free MOFs to OMS&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;MOFs for developing high&#8208;performance SPEs, and explored the underlying mechanism. The &#8220;OMS&#8208;polymer&#8221; and &#8220;OMS&#8208;ion&#8221; interactions were investigated in detail to elucidate the role of quasi&#8208;MOFs on battery performance. It was found that quasi&#8208;MOFs, functioning as ion sieves, can effectively regulate ion migration, thus promoting uniform Li deposition and enabling an ultra&#8208;stable interface. As a result, the Li symmetric cell stably ran over 3000&#8197;h at 0.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, while the full cell retained 85&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1500&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C. Finally, universal testing was performed using other MOFs, confirming the generalizability and effectiveness of our design concept.

         <title>Manipulating Aggregate Electrochemistry for High&#8208;Performance Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation of electroactive organic molecules in solution yields a linear relationship between the potential shift and the aggregation number, yielding a substantial voltage loss at a high concentration in an organic redox flow battery. Molecular anti&#8208;aggregation strategy is applied and the sensitivity between the voltage and the concentration is lowered.







Abstract
Organic molecule in solutions is the energy storage unit in the organic redox flow batteries (ORFBs), of which the aggregation is acknowledged pivotal but has been rarely investigated. By establishing a pyridinium library, the manipulation over the aggregation in solutions is investigated at the molecular level. Both theoretical calculations and physiochemical methods are used to characterize the aggregate's structure, and salient findings are as follows. First, the singly&#8208;reduced monoradicals simultaneously aggregate in a concentrated solution, which is driven by the solvation effect, orbital overlap and dispersion interaction. Second, the aggregation can be manipulated by the molecular engineering strategy and counteracted by introducing either electrostatic repulsive force or twisted geometry. Third, the monoradical's aggregation yields a decrease in the molecular singly occupied molecular orbital energy level and a linear scaling relationship with its thermodynamic potential. As a result, the increase in the concentration lowers the battery's voltage, which counteracts its effort to increase the battery's energy density. The anti&#8208;aggregation is proven effective in breaking the scaling relationship and accordingly, a molecular strategy to manipulate aggregate electrochemistry is developed. This work provides physical insights into the electrolytic solution and chemical strategy for optimizing the flow battery.

In this study, we engineered a wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system utilizing the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer strategy. This system integrates a photoactivated long&#8208;lived luminescent material as the energy donor with a fluorescent photoswitch as the energy acceptor, facilitating programmable persistent luminescence switches. Distinct afterglow color states, such as initial nonemissive, green, yellow, and orange, were achieved through irradiation at 400&#8197;nm, 365&#8197;nm, and 254&#8197;nm, respectively. Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states.







Abstract
Controlling multicolor persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) through photoirradiation holds fundamental significance but remains a significant challenge. In this study, we engineered a wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system utilizing the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer strategy. This system integrates a photoactivated long&#8208;lived luminescent material as the energy donor with a fluorescent photoswitch as the energy acceptor, facilitating programmable persistent luminescence switches. Distinct afterglow color states, such as initial nonemissive, green, yellow, and orange, were achieved through irradiation at 400&#8197;nm, 365&#8197;nm, and 254&#8197;nm, respectively. Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of this wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system in the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of multicolor afterglow images on a single thin film. This work represents a substantial step towards the fabrication of sophisticated wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive systems, potentially revolutionizing applications in optical data storage, security labeling, and smart displays by enabling precise control over photoresponsive behaviors under various photoirradiation wavelengths.

         <title>Boron Enabled Directed [2+2]&#8208; and Dearomative [4+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions Initiated by Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two methods are presented for the directed cycloaddition of alkenylboronates. In one method, [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allylic amines and heterocycles to arrive at diverse cyclobutanes is presented. In a second process, dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition allows for the synthesis of rigid building blocks from naphthalenes and alkenylboronate. Both processes allow for the construction of complex molecules with high regio and stereocontrol from simple reaction components.







Abstract
A strategy for the photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between styrenyl dihaloboranes and unactivated allylamines to access cyclobutylboronates with control of stereochemistry and regiochemistry is presented. The success of the reaction relies on the temporary coordination between in situ generated dihaloboranes and amines under mild reaction conditions. In addition, cyclobutanes with varying substitution patterns have been prepared using N&#8208;heterocycles as directing group. Manipulation of the C&#8722;B bond allows for the synthesis of a diverse class of cyclobutanes from simple precursors. Moreover, these reactions lead to the synthesis of complex amines and heteroaromatic compounds, which have significant utility in medicinal chemistry. Finally, a dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of naphthalenes using a boron&#8208;enabled temporary tethering strategy has also been uncovered to synthesize complex 3&#8208;dimensional borylated building blocks.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Agnostic Bioactivity&#8208;Driven Combinatorial Biosynthesis Reveals New Antidiabetic and Anticancer Triterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;agnostic bioactivity&#8208;driven combinatorial biosynthesis workflow is presented that introduces bioactivity assessment as a selection&#8208;driving force to guide iterative combinatorial biosynthesis rounds towards enzyme combinations with increasing bioactivity. By integrating combinatorial biosynthesis, metabolic engineering, and bioactivity profiling, baker's yeast was engineered to produce structurally diverse triterpenoids as antidiabetic and anticancer agents.







Abstract
Although combinatorial biosynthesis can dramatically expand the chemical structures of bioactive natural products to identify molecules with improved characteristics, progress in this direction has been hampered by the difficulty in isolating and characterizing the numerous produced compounds. This challenge could be overcome with improved designs that enable the analysis of the bioactivity of the produced metabolites ahead of the time&#8208;consuming isolation procedures. Herein, we showcase a structure&#8208;agnostic bioactivity&#8208;driven combinatorial biosynthesis workflow that introduces bioactivity assessment as a selection&#8208;driving force to guide iterative combinatorial biosynthesis rounds towards enzyme combinations with increasing bioactivity. We apply this approach to produce triterpenoids with potent bioactivity against PTP1B, a promising molecular target for diabetes and cancer treatment. We demonstrate that the bioactivity&#8208;guided workflow can expedite the combinatorial process by enabling the narrowing down of more than 1000&#8197;possible combinations to only five highly potent candidates. By focusing the isolation and structural elucidation effort on only these five strains, we reveal 20&#8197;structurally diverse triterpenoids, including four new compounds and a novel triterpenoid&#8208;anthranilic acid hybrid, as potent PTP1B inhibitors. This workflow expedites hit identification by combinatorial biosynthesis and is applicable to many other types of bioactive natural products, therefore providing a strategy for accelerated drug discovery.

         <title>I3&#8722;&#8208;Mediated Oxygen Evolution Activities to Boost Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance with Low Charging Voltage and Long Cycling Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

We apply acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3&#8722;&#8208;mediated Zn&#8208;air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3&#8722; during the electrochemically charging process to chemically react with OH&#8722; to generate oxygen and further revert to I&#8722;, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system.







Abstract
An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal&#8208;air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn&#8208;air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3&#8722;&#8208;mediated Zn&#8208;air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3&#8722; to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn&#8208;air battery performs an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 600&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87&#8197;V. We demonstrate that I&#8722; mainly generates I3&#8722; on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH&#8722; to generate oxygen and further revert to I&#8722;, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system. This work offers a strategy to simultaneously improve the cycling life and reduce the charging voltage of Zn&#8208;air batteries through redox mediator methods.

         <title>Stabilization of High&#8208;Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the dynamic equilibriums of Co2+/3+ states is proposed as a novel strategy to enhance oxygen evolution. P heteroatoms of reduced graphene oxide are applied to link Co2+ acetylacetonate. By increasing the oxidation degrees of P heteroatoms, the Co sites are spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling. The as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibits intrinsically high oxygen evolution activity.







Abstract
Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH&#8722;/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.

     alt="Stabilization of High-Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stabilization of high-valent Co sites to shift away from the dynamic equilibriums of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+/3+&lt;/sup&gt; states is proposed as a novel strategy to enhance oxygen evolution. P heteroatoms of reduced graphene oxide are applied to link Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; acetylacetonate. By increasing the oxidation degrees of P heteroatoms, the Co sites are spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions coupling. The as-derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibits intrinsically high oxygen evolution activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; states coupling with OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high-valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, the as-derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A series of novel donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has been precisely designed and synthesized. Among them gFBT&#8208;g2T showed the highest normalized peak transconductance (gm,norm) of 298&#177;10.4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance (&#956;C*) of 847&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which was comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. gFBT&#8208;g2T also exhibited exceptional ultra&#8208;high temperature stability, maintaining the outstanding electrochemical performance even after undergoing the standard autoclave steam sterilization procedure.







Abstract
We present a series of newly developed donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers designed specifically for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) synthesized by a straightforward route. All polymers exhibited accumulation mode behavior in OECT devices, and tuning of the donor comonomer resulted in a three&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in transconductance. The best polymer gFBT&#8208;g2T, exhibited normalized peak transconductance (gm,norm) of 298&#177;10.4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with a corresponding product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance, &#956;C*, of 847&#8201;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a &#956; of 5.76&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, amongst the highest reported to date. Furthermore, gFBT&#8208;g2T exhibited exceptional temperature stability, maintaining the outstanding electrochemical performance even after undergoing a standard (autoclave) high pressure steam sterilization procedure. Steam treatment was also found to promote film porosity, with the formation of circular 200&#8211;400&#8197;nm voids. These results demonstrate the potential of gFBT&#8208;g2T in p&#8208;type accumulation mode OECTs, and pave the way for the use in implantable bioelectronics for medical applications.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic Cell with Molecular Biomimetic Thylakoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) using a molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP&#8208;FePy) can split water into hydrogen and oxygen at a low driving voltage (1.1&#8197;V) and mild conditions. By temporally and spatially coupling light and dark reactions, the APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1&#8201;%, showcasing the potential of artificial photosynthetic system.







Abstract
The construction of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion system by mimicking the photosynthetic network of the chloroplast holds great promise on efficient solar energy utilization. We developed an artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) based on molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP&#8208;FePy) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltage (1.1&#8197;V) and neutral condition (pH&#8776;7). The CoTPP&#8208;FePy can emulate the light reaction in thylakoids to produce O2 by coupling light harvesting, photocatalysis, and electron/energy storage (FeIII/FeII&#8722;Py). Subsequently, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were employed to simulate the dark reaction, wherein the proton, electron and energy generated by the light reaction can drive the H2 producing process. By a temporally and spatially coupling of the light and dark reactions, the resulting APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1&#8201;%, exceeding that of natural photosynthetic systems and demonstrating the potential of artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;Br Substituted Benzophenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multiple attractive dispersion interaction strategy, a challenging asymmetric hydrogenation of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;Br substituted benzophenones is reported using an earth&#8208;abundant metal copper catalyst, affording the corresponding chiral benzhydrols in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess). The catalytic mechanism was investigated via experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation of benzophenones, catalyzed by low&#8208;activity earth&#8208;abundant metal copper, has hitherto remained a challenge due to the substrates equipped with two indistinguishably similar aryl groups. In this study, we demonstrated that the prochiral carbon of the ortho&#8208;bromine substrate exhibits the highest electrophilicity and high reactivity among the ortho&#8208;halogen substituted benzophenones, as determined by the Fukui function (f+) analysis and hydrogenation reaction. Considering that the enantiodirecting functional bromine group can be easily derivatized and removed in the products, we successfully achieved a green copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ortho&#8208;bromine substituted benzophenones. This method yielded a series of chiral benzhydrols with excellent results. The utility of this protocol has been validated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent product transformations. Independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA) indicate that the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC multiple attractive dispersion interactions (MADI) effect between the catalyst and substrate enhances the catalyst's activity.

         <title>A Helicene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Inductor and Capacitor with Frequency&#8208;Dependent Charge&#8208;Transport Pathways</title>

Investigation of charge transport behaviors in Helicene&#8208;based molecular wires under alternating currents of varying frequencies.







Abstract
Despite extensive studies has been explored on single&#8208;molecule switches and rectifiers, the design of single&#8208;molecule inductors has not been explored due to the experimental challenges in the investigation of frequency&#8208;dependent charge transport at the single&#8208;molecule scale. In this study, we synthesized a helicene&#8208;based helical molecular wire and carried out meticulous single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, combined with current&#8211;voltage (IV) studies with varying frequencies using the scanning tunneling microscope break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Our results reveal the formation of a single&#8208;molecule junction and highlight the unique behavior of the molecular wire in response to different alternating current (AC) varying frequencies. The transport of charges occurs selectively either through the coiled backbone of the conjugated helical structure or vertically via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, depending on the frequency of the applied AC. Notably, our investigation demonstrates the functionality of the wire as an inductor at low frequencies, and a capacitor at high frequencies. This work lays the foundation for a systematic approach to designing, fabricating, and implementing single&#8208;molecule logic devices such as inductors and wave filters.

In this study, we synthesized a helicene-based helical molecular wire and carried out meticulous single-molecule conductance measurements, combined with current&#8211;voltage (IV) studies with varying frequencies using the scanning tunneling microscope break junction (STM-BJ) technique. Our results reveal the formation of a single-molecule junction and highlight the unique behavior of the molecular wire in response to different alternating current (AC) varying frequencies. The transport of charges occurs selectively either through the coiled backbone of the conjugated helical structure or vertically via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, depending on the frequency of the applied AC. Notably, our investigation demonstrates the functionality of the wire as an inductor at low frequencies, and a capacitor at high frequencies. This work lays the foundation for a systematic approach to designing, fabricating, and implementing single-molecule logic devices such as inductors and wave filters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Induced &#8220;Breathing&#8208;Helical&#8221; Dynamic System of a Porphyrinic Metallo&#8208;Organic Cage for Advanced Conformational Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallo&#8208;organic cage with a flexible inner cavity and freely twisted side chains has been obtained by the assembly of terpyridine&#8208;terminated porphyrinic ligands. This cage exhibited excellent packaging capability with fullerenes, with a higher binding affinity for C70 and the resulting host&#8208;guest complex showing an unprecedent coexistence of racemic and symmetric conformations.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest dynamic systems in coordination&#8208;driven metallo&#8208;organic cages have gained significant attentions since their promising applications in chiral separation, drug delivery, and catalytical fields. To maximize guest&#8208;binding affinity, hosts adopting multiple conformations are widely investigated on their structural flexibility for guest accommodation. In this study, a novel metallo&#8208;organic cage S with breathing inner cavity and freely twisted side chains was proposed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses depicted a characteristic &#8220;breathing&#8208;helical&#8221; dynamic system on the semiflexible framework, which led to an unprecedent co&#8208;crystallisation of racemic and symmetric conformations via the encapsulation locking of C70 guests. By taking advantages of the high binding affinity, selective extraction of C70 was realized. This research provides new ideas for the modification on the helicities of metallo&#8208;organic cages, which could pave a new way for advanced conformational manipulation of supramolecular host systems.

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slightly varying the steric demand in the immediate proximity to an intermolecular recognition moiety, tailored the efficacy of the resulting assembled state as a seed for initiating supramolecular polymerization of other structurally related compounds. Accordingly, narcissistic as well as social self&#8208;sorting from the same binary mixture of molecularly trapped species were achieved depending on the addition sequence of different seeds.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.

         <title>Tandem Methanolysis and Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate to p&#8208;Xylene Over Cu/ZnZrOx Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a one&#8208;pot, H2&#8208;free strategy, methanol is used as a liquid organic H2 carrier and solvent for the methanolysis and catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to produce p&#8208;xylene, an important gasoline and jet&#8208;fuel component, on a Cu/ZnZrOx catalyst. The interfacial sites between Cu and the reducible ZnZrOx support are critical for the activation of both methanol and the monomer dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and for facilitating a low&#8208;energy reaction pathway.







Abstract
We demonstrate a novel approach of utilizing methanol (CH3OH) in a dual role for (1) the methanolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to form dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) at near&#8208;quantitative yields (~97&#8201;%) and (2) serving as an in situ H2 source for the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis (CTH) of DMT to p&#8208;xylene (PX, ~63&#8201;% at 240&#8201;&#176;C and 16&#8197;h) on a reducible ZnZrOx supported Cu catalyst (i.e., Cu/ZnZrOx). Pre&#8208; and post&#8208;reaction surface and bulk characterization, along with density functional theory (DFT) computations, explicate the dual role of the metal&#8208;support interface of Cu/ZnZrOx in activating both CH3OH and DMT and facilitating a lower free&#8208;energy pathway for both CH3OH dehydrogenation and DMT hydrogenolysis, compared to Cu supported on a redox&#8208;neutral SiO2 support. Loading studies and thermodynamic calculations showed that, under reaction conditions, CH3OH in the gas phase, rather than in the liquid phase, is critical for CTH of DMT. Interestingly, the Cu/ZnZrOx catalyst was also effective for the methanolysis and hydrogenolysis of C&#8722;C bonds (compared to C&#8722;O bonds for PET) of waste polycarbonate (PC), largely forming xylenol (~38&#8201;%) and methyl isopropyl anisole (~42&#8201;%) demonstrating the versatility of this approach toward valorizing a wide range of condensation polymers.

         <title>Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules through Top Interface Modification with N&#8208;type Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type Semiconductors can optimize the top interface of inverted perovskite solar cells (i&#8208;PSCs) and modules (i&#8208;PSMs) without negatively affecting the underlying perovskite layer, effectively enhancing the device efficiency and stability. Consequently, a remarkable efficiency of 25.82% was obtained for Y7&#8208;BO&#8208;based i&#8208;PSCs, and record efficiencies of 23.06%, 22.32%, 21.10% were achieved from Y7&#8208;BO&#8208;based i&#8208;PSMs with 50 cm2, 400 cm2, 1160 cm2 areas, respectively, along with superior stability.







Abstract
The interface modification between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in achieving high performance inverted perovskite photovoltaics (i&#8208;PPVs). Herein, non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), known as Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO, were utilized to modify the perovskite/ETL interface in i&#8208;PPVs. Non&#8208;polar solvent&#8208;soluble NFAs can effectively passivate surface defects without structural damage of the underlying perovskite films. Additionally, the improved phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETL induced by NFAs modification significantly accelerates the electrons extraction. As a result, both Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO exhibit more effective interface modification effects compared to traditional PI molecules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted perovskite solar cell (i&#8208;PSC) modified with Y7&#8208;BO reaches 25.82&#8201;%. Moreover, the adoption of non&#8208;polar solvents and the superior semiconductor properties of Y7&#8208;BO molecules also enable perovskite solar modules (i&#8208;PSM) with effective areas of 50&#8197;cm2, 400&#8197;cm2, and 1160&#8197;cm2 to achieve record efficiencies of 23.05&#8201;%, 22.32&#8201;%, and 21.1&#8201;% (certified PCE), respectively, making them the best PCE reported in the literature. Importantly, enhanced interface mechanical strength between the perovskite and PCBM layer results in significantly improved environmental and operational stability of the cells. The cells modified with Y7&#8208;BO maintained 94.4&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1522&#8197;hours of maximum power point aging.

Moreover, the adoption of non-polar solvents and the superior semiconductor properties of Y7-BO molecules also enable perovskite solar modules (i-PSM) with effective areas of 50&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 400&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1160&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to achieve record efficiencies of 23.05&#8201;%, 22.32&#8201;%, and 21.1&#8201;% (certified PCE), respectively, making them the best PCE reported in the literature. Importantly, enhanced interface mechanical strength between the perovskite and PCBM layer results in significantly improved environmental and operational stability of the cells. The cells modified with Y7-BO maintained 94.4&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1522&#8197;hours of maximum power point aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Redox Reactions of Silver Hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue Analogue Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Zinc&#8208;ion Storage
</title>

A vacancy and water&#8208;free silver hexacyanoferrate cathode (K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework, exhibiting a notable reversible capacity of 179.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 through a four&#8208;electron transfer mechanism involving the redox reactions of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag0.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been employed as host materials of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), however, they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to limited electron transfer and the presence of interstitial water in PBAs. Herein, a vacancy and water&#8208;free silver hexacyanoferrate K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6 (AgHCF&#8208;3) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework. It offers nearly four electrons involving two sequential redox reactions, namely, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag0, to deliver a large capacity of 179.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with Coulomb efficiency of ~100&#8201;%. The Zn//AgHCF&#8208;3&#8197;cell delivers an estimated energy density of 200&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, surpassing reported PBAs&#8208;based ZIBs. The formation of Ag0 in the cycling process merits favorable rate performance of AgHCF&#8208;3 (156.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 80.3&#8201;% capacity retention after 100 cycles). This investigation paves new pathways for high&#8208;capacity PBA cathodes.

         <title>Constructing Unsaturated Ru Atom Arrays Confined in Mn Oxides to Boost Neutral Water Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered low&#8208;coordinated Ru atom arrays are constructed and confined in Li4Mn5O12 as efficient electrocatalysts for neutral HER. The good HER activity is attributed to the low&#8208;coordinated Ru atoms with strong water dissociation ability, in conjunction with the unique array&#8208;like structure for allowing the direct coupling of two H* intermediates on two adjacent Ru atoms.







Abstract
Recently, Ru single atoms supported on carbon nanomaterials have demonstrated ultrahigh activity for acid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), however their neutral HER activity remains low due to the sluggish kinetics for both the water dissociation step to generate H* intermediates and subsequent H* recombination in neutral electrolytes. Here, we synthesize ordered low&#8208;coordinated Ru atom arrays confined in Mn oxides (i.e., Li4Mn5O12) for concurrently boosting the water dissociation and H* recombination, thus achieving a 6&#8208;fold HER activity enhancement than commercial Pt/C in neutral media. Control experiments indicate that low&#8208;coordinated Ru atoms with strong affinity to oxygen atoms of water molecules facilitate the water dissociation to rapidly generate H*. More importantly, both electrochemical and theoretic results uncover that the array&#8208;like structure allows the activation of two water molecules on two adjacent Ru atoms for enabling direct H*&#8722;H* recombination via the Tafel step, while isolated Ru atoms can only activate water one by one for recombining H* via the sluggish Heyrovsky step. Clearly, this work paves new avenues to boosting the electrocatalytic activity by constructing ordered metal atoms assembles with controllable coordination environments.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Gene Expression System Using a Caging&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Photoactivatable Dye</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced gene expression system was developed using a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye with a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator, QacR. This system allowed transcriptional activation with mild visible light exposure, large dynamic range, and simultaneous detection of the state of the effector molecule in cell&#8208;free and cellular conditions.







Abstract
Optical regulation of transcription using chemical compounds is an effective strategy to manipulate gene expression spatiotemporally. Conventional caging approaches with photoremovable protecting groups may require intense UV&#8208;light exposure and release potentially toxic byproducts. To address these problems, here we developed a light&#8208;mediated transcriptional regulation system by combining a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye PaX560 and a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator QacR. The cationic dye generated from PaX560 through traceless photoconversion bound QacR and reduced its repressor function, resulting in transcriptional activation. Importantly, this system allowed transcriptional activation with a large dynamic range under mild visible light exposure and simultaneous detection of the state of the photoactivated effector. This module was integrated into the T7 RNA polymerase expression system to demonstrate light&#8208;activated transcription in vitro and in living cells.

         <title>Fluorescence Modulation through the Inverted Energy Gap Law in Triply N&#8722;B&#8592;N&#8208;Containing Windmill&#8208;Shaped Triazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of heterocyclic molecules exhibits uncommon fluorescence phenomena, displaying more redshifted emission yet concurrently achieving heightened fluorescence efficiency, which appears to violate the established &#8220;energy gap law&#8221;. The deactivation routes are primarily governed by the energy barriers encountered in the excited states, particularly from the Franck&#8211;Condon region to the conical intersection point.







Abstract
A series of windmill&#8208;shape heterocyclic molecules containing three N&#8722;B&#8592;N units, TBN and its derivatives, with quasi&#8208;planar C3 symmetric backbone, are synthesized. The parent TBN exhibits a strongly allowed, doubly degenerate lowest excited state but suffers from very low fluorescence, due to very fast nonradiative decay rate through a conical intersection (CI) as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Introducing peripheral phenyl&#8208; or thienyl&#8208;groups (Ph&#8208;TBN or Th&#8208;TBN) induces pronounced bathochromic shifts and enhances fluorescence, which is beneficial from inhibited nonradiative pathway by the increased energy barriers to access the CI at excited state. The understanding of this rather uncommon behaviour may open routes for the design of novel fluorescence materials.

         <title>A Synthetic Oligosaccharide Resembling Francisella tularensis Strain 15 O&#8208;Antigen Capsular Polysaccharide as a Lead for Tularemia Diagnostics and Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

Thirteen glycans resembling zoonotic pathogen Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis) strain 15 O&#8208;antigen capsular polysaccharide were chemically synthesized. The glycans were used to screen the sera of pigs, horses, cats, dogs and rabbits for antibodies. The glycan array study identified minimal epitopes for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines against F. tularensis.







Abstract
Francisella tularensis, a category A bioterrorism agent, causes tularemia in many animal species. F. tularensis subspecies tularensis (type A) and holarctica (type B) are mainly responsible for human tularemia. The high mortality rate of 30&#8211;60&#8201;% caused by F. tularensis subspecies tularensis if left untreated and the aerosol dispersal renders this pathogen a dangerous bioagent. While a live attenuated vaccine strain (LVS) of F. tularensis type B does not provide sufficient protection against all forms of tularemia infections, a significant level of protection against F. tularensis has been observed for both passive and active immunization of mice with isolated O&#8208;antigen capsular polysaccharide. Well&#8208;defined, synthetic oligosaccharides offer an alternative approach towards the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. To identify diagnostics and therapeutics leads against tularemia, a collection of F. tularensis strain 15 O&#8208;antigen capsular polysaccharide epitopes were chemically synthesized. Glycan microarrays containing synthetic glycans were used to analyze the sera of tularemia&#8208;infected and non&#8208;infected animals and revealed the presence of IgG antibodies against the glycans. Two disaccharide (13 and 18), both bearing a unique formamido moiety, were identified as minimal glycan epitopes for antibody binding. These epitopes are the starting point for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics against tularemia.

         <title>Unlocking Oxetane Potential: Modular Synthetic Platform for the Concise Synthesis of Acyclic Oligo&#8208;Isoprenoids and Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxetane&#8208;based platform has been developed for the modular and iterative construction of oxygenated oligo&#8208;isoprenoids with precise geometric control of the olefinic bond(s). In addition, the dual reactivity of alkenyl oxetane fragment has been revealed and exploited to reroute polyene cyclization to the subterminal position.







Abstract
Terpenes occupy a unique place among the secondary metabolites due to their broad utility and extraordinary structural diversity. Their synthesis via polyene cyclization, either biomimetic or enzymatic, represents the cutting edge of modern synthetic chemistry. However, these endeavors have been inherently tied to the availability of natural and non&#8208;natural acyclic polyene starting materials. Herein, we report an oxetane&#8208;based platform for the modular construction of oxygenated polyolefins with precise geometric control. This &#8220;tail&#8208;to head&#8221; iterative method leverages the site&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis of terminal olefins to form an alkylidene oxetane moiety and the regioselective ring opening of alkenyl&#8208;oxetanes for chain elongation. In addition, the unique and peculiar propensity of alkylidene oxetane fragment in various reactions was also revealed and exploited for site&#8208;selective functionalization, cyclization, and as a protecting group in polyenes.

         <title>Modulating Pore Wall Chemistry Empowers Sonodynamic Activity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Pro&#8208;Oxidative Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pore wall chemistry modulation approach is proposed for imparting sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions composed of inert bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Among isoreticular counterparts, significant sonodynamic performance is demonstrated only in the heterojunctions with vinyl groups decorated on the pore walls of COFs, which is attributed to the accelerated separation and transfer of charge carriers.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered growing interest in the field of biomedicine; however, their application in sonodynamic therapy remains underexplored due to limited understanding of their intrinsic activity and structure&#8211;property relationships. Here, we present a pore wall chemistry modulation strategy for empowering sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF heterojunctions through in&#8197;situ growth of COFs on bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets (B&#8197;NSs). Compared to the negligible sonodynamic effects observed in the pristine B&#8197;NSs, the 2D heterojunction with vinyl&#8208;decorated COF pore walls demonstrates a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in sonocatalytic singlet oxygen generation. This performance also significantly outperforms that of isoreticular COFs functionalized with methoxy or non&#8208;substituted groups. Mechanistic studies reveal that the vinyl groups in the B@COF (BC) heterojunction facilitate the separation and transfer of charge carriers while also enhancing the adsorption of oxygen molecules. Furthermore, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) loading into the porous COFs boosts the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor nanotherapy via sonocatalytic dual oxidative species generation. These findings underscore the critical role of pore wall chemistry in modulating the sonocatalytic properties of COFs, and advance the development of COF&#8208;based sonosensitizers for pro&#8208;oxidative applications.

This study highlights the crucial role of DFT calculations in screening non&#8208;radioactive lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks for optimal electrochemical CO2 reduction performance. The findings underscore the significant impact of f&#8208;&#960;* orbital interactions in enhancing catalytic efficiency with Lu&#8208;HHTP and selectivity towards methane production.







Abstract
The research on electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) catalysts using renewable energy is particularly crucial in energy conversion studies, especially for viable hydrocarbon production. This study employs density functional theory calculations to screen a series of non&#8208;radioactive lanthanide two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for product selectivity in ECR. Based on theoretical screening, our focus is on a lutetium (Lu)&#8208;based conducting MOF (Lu&#8208;HHTP), which exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of approximately 77&#8201;% for methane (CH4) production and maintains a stable current density of &#8722;280&#8197;mA/cm2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE. In situ electrochemical experiments and material characterization demonstrate that the Lu sites possess high coordination stability and structural recoverability during catalytic CO2 reduction, attributed to the overlap between Lu&#8242;s f&#8208;orbitals and the &#960;*&#8208;orbitals of the ligand O, and the formation of back bonding orbitals between the f&#8208;orbitals of Lu and the &#960;* orbitals of CO contribute increasing CH4 selectivity and lowering the potential. This study leverages rare&#8208;earth MOF&#8208;type materials, offering a novel approach to addressing low conductivity and stabilizing rare&#8208;earth materials, thereby establishing a theoretical framework for the conversion of linearly adsorbed *CO into hydrocarbons.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cycloheptadienones Starting from Phenols and Using a Rhodium/Boron Asymmetric Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeletal editing offers a unique route to assemble complex architectures from simple feedstocks that are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, the asymmetric version of skeletal editing has not been widely studied. Herein, we present a modular rhodium/boron asymmetric catalytic system that enables ring&#8208;expansion of phenols with cyclopropenes to synthesize highly functionalized cycloheptadienones in excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. This unique protocol features with low&#8208;catalyst loading, atom and step&#8208;economies, and mild neutral reaction conditions.

Skeletal editing offers a unique route to assemble complex architectures from simple feedstocks that are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, the asymmetric version of skeletal editing has not been widely studied. Herein, we present a modular rhodium/boron asymmetric catalytic system that enables ring&#8208;expansion of phenols with cyclopropenes to synthesize highly functionalized cycloheptadienones in excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. This unique protocol features with low&#8208;catalyst loading, atom and step&#8208;economies, and mild neutral reaction conditions. Isotope&#8208;labelling experiments and DFT calculations have been conducted to reveal that boron reagent plays a vital role in the whole catalytic cycle.

         <title>A Strongly Reducing sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Formed by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene dimerization has been used to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework for the first time. Due to its unique tetraazafulvalene linkages, the resultant COF is strongly reducing, enabling stabilization of the rarely isolable tetracyanoethylene radical anion within its pores.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks linked by carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds (C=C COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline, porous, and conjugated polymeric materials with potential applications in organic electronics, photocatalysis, and energy storage. Despite the rapidly growing interest in sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs, only a small number of closely related condensation reactions have been successfully employed for their synthesis to date. Herein, we report the first example of a C=C COF, CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1 (CORN=Cornell University), prepared by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) dimerization. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional layered structure and hexagonal guest&#8208;accessible pores decorated with a high density of strongly reducing tetraazafulvalene linkages. Exposure of CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1 to tetracyanoethylene (TCNE, E1/2=0.13&#8197;V and &#8722;0.87&#8197;V vs. SCE) oxidizes the COF and encapsulates the radical anion TCNE&#8901;&#8722; and the dianion TCNE2&#8722; as guest molecules, as confirmed by spectroscopic and magnetic analysis. Notably, the reactive TCNE&#8901;&#8722; radical anion, which generally dimerizes in the solid state, is uniquely stabilized within the pores of CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1. Overall, our findings broaden the toolbox of reactions available for the synthesis of redox&#8208;active C=C COFs, paving the way for the design of novel materials.

         <title>Evolution of Frustrated Coordination in Eutectic Electrolyte Driven by Ligand Asymmetry toward High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large coordination frustration driven by molecular asymmetry of ligands and disordered cation&#8208;ligand&#8208;anion&#8208;water eutectic coordination can lead to relatively enhanced chemical stability, weak coordination strength and promoted mass mobility in eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.







Abstract
Eutectic electrolytes hold promise for aqueous zinc metal batteries in sustainable energy storage chemistries, yet improvement from perspective of molecule configurational engineering are ambiguous. Herein, we propose design strategy of increasing asymmetric molecular geometry in organic ligands to regulate frustrated coordination and disordered structure for eutectic electrolytes toward enhanced zinc metal batteries. The introduced asymmetry in eutectic component gives rise to relatively weak coordination strength and configurational disorder interaction among cation&#8208;anion&#8208;ligand, leading to suppressed local aggregation, steady eutectic phase and improved Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Such highly frustrated coordination state also enables disruption of hydrogen bonding network and reinforcement of anion participation, which results in confined side reactions, decreased water activity and the formation of inorganic&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase. In comparison to highly symmetric ligands, asymmetric ligand&#8208;involved eutectic electrolytes with configurational disorder deliver high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;%, stabilized Zn plating/stripping of 5000&#8197;h and impressive rate capability even under harsh conditions such as small N/P, low temperature. The rationale in this work advances the deep understanding of asymmetric molecular engineering in eutectic electrolytes and showcases suitability of frustrated coordination to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.

         <title>A Knowledge&#8211;Data Dual&#8208;Driven Framework for Predicting the Molecular Properties of Rechargeable Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI) framework, driven by both knowledge and data, predicts electrolyte molecular properties. The KPI collects data, uncovers structure&#8211;property relationships, accurately predicts melting, boiling, and flash points, and identifies promising molecules for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range battery applications. It serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.







Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries that operate within a wide temperature range and possess high safety has become necessary with increasing demands. Rapid and accurate assessment of the melting points (MPs), boiling points (BPs), and flash points (FPs) of electrolyte molecules is essential for expediting battery development. Herein, we introduce Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI), a knowledge&#8211;data dual&#8208;driven framework for molecular property prediction of electrolytes. Initially, the KPI collects molecular structures and properties, and then automatically organizes them into structured datasets. Subsequently, interpretable machine learning further explores the structure&#8211;property relationships of molecules from a microscopic perspective. Finally, by embedding the discovered knowledge into property prediction models, the KPI achieved very low mean absolute errors of 10.4, 4.6, and 4.8&#8197;K for MP, BP, and FP predictions, respectively. The KPI reached state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art results in 18 out of 20 datasets. Utilizing molecular neighbor search and high&#8208;throughput screening, 15 and 14 promising molecules, with and without Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, respectively, were predicted for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range and high&#8208;safety batteries. The KPI not only accurately predicts molecular properties and deepens the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships but also serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure Determination by 3D Electron Diffraction of the Extra&#8208;large Pore Zeolite ITQ&#8208;70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of the pure silica zeolite ITQ&#8208;70 is presented. The complete structure determination of this material, including its organic structure directing agent, is carried out by 3D electron diffraction, with the support of MAS&#8197;NMR and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This material presents a tridimensional system of intercrossing extra&#8208;large pores, with 18&#8208;ring openings, and the lowest framework density reported up to now for any zeolite containing oxygen connecting T&#8208;atoms.







Abstract
In this study, we present the synthesis, characterization, and structural analysis of a novel zeolite, ITQ&#8208;70, using 3D electron diffraction. This unique material was synthesized under alkaline conditions, employing tetrakis(diethylamino)phosphonium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent, leading to the formation of a pure silica zeolite. ITQ&#8208;70 is distinguished by its extra&#8208;large pore apertures, which extend along all three axes and intersect one to the other. A notable feature of this zeolite is the presence of structurally ordered defects in very high concentrations (38&#8201;% of the silicon atoms). As a result, ITQ&#8208;70 exhibits the lowest framework density (10.0 T/1000&#8197;&#197;3) ever reported for any zeolite except RWY (7.6 T/1000&#8197;&#197;3), which contains sulfur instead of oxygen connecting T&#8208;atoms.

         <title>De(sulfon)amidative Cyclization: The Synthesis of Dibenzolactams and Dibenzosultams for Organic Light Emitting Diode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cleavage of (sulfon)amides: Transition metal&#8208;free de(sulfon)amidative cyclizations offer facile synthetic routes to dibenzolactams and dibenzosultams, providing an innovative synthetic toolbox for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials used in blue OLEDs.







Abstract
This study addresses a challenge in organic synthetic chemistry: the direct cleavage of amide bonds, which is typically hampered by the thermodynamic stability of the C(Ar)&#8722;C(acyl) bond. Previous methods often rely on &#8220;CO&#8221; extrusion&#8208;jointing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed process and require activated tertiary amides, limiting their applicability due to incompatibility with reactive functional groups such as halogens. Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free approach for the deamidative cyclization of biaryl diamides via a radical process, yielding dibenzolactam derivatives. Along this line, we have developed the desulfonamidative cyclization of biaryl disulfonamides to produce dibenzosultams through direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution, demonstrating high selectivity for unsymmetrical structures. Additionally, unsymmetrical sulfamoyl biaryl amides, containing both amide and sulfonamide functionalities, can selectively undergo desulfonamidative coupling with the amide to form dibenzolactams, which offers a complementary synthetic pathway to unsymmetric dibenzolactams. These protocols exhibit excellent compatibility with reactive functional groups, including halogens, providing an innovative synthetic toolbox for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). DMAC&#8208;PDO, incorporating a dibenzolactam as the acceptor unit, serves as an efficient blue TADF emitter with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 23.4&#8201;%.

         <title>CO&#8208;Tolerant Heterogeneous Ruthenium Catalysts for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts without phosphorus were designed and synthesized for formic acid dehydrogenation in the absence of additives. Theoretical calculations, catalytical experiments and characterization proved that the coordination of nitrogen to ruthenium inhibited the formation the CO and weakened the adsorption of CO over ruthenium. Thus, the catalysts exhibited good catalytic performance for formic acid dehydrogenation and excellent tolerance to CO.







Abstract
The development of improved and less costly catalysts for dehydrogenation of formic acid (HCOOH) is of general interest for renewable energy technologies involving hydrogen storage and release. Theoretical calculations reveal that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon should be appropriate catalysts for such transformations. It is predicted that nitrogen doping significantly decreases the formation of CO, but at the same time increases CO tolerance of the catalysts. To prove these hypotheses heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts supported on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Rux/CN) with hierarchical structure were synthesized using carbon nitride (C3N4) as template and phenanthroline (Phen) as ligand. Experimental tests in HCOOH dehydrogenation revealed that the optimal catalyst Ru7/CN exhibited good thermal stability at 140 &#176;C and a high turnover frequency (TOF &gt;1300&#8197;h&#8722;1), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Ru5/C catalyst.

         <title>Clay Nanosheet&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Supramolecular Hydrogel Enabling Rapid, Reversible Phase Transition Only with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High mechanical properties and rapid phase transition are mutually exclusive in hydrogels, probably because the gel networks of mechanically robust hydrogels usually comprise thick bundled fibers. However, the hydrogel we designed using a photoresponsive nanocomposite supramolecular network showed a rapid photochemical sol/gel phase transition and a relatively high mechanical robustness.







Abstract
High mechanical properties and rapid sol/gel phase transition are mutually exclusive in the hydrogels reported to date, most likely because the 3D crosslinked networks of mechanically robust hydrogels comprise bundled thick fibers that are not rapidly dissociable or formable. Herein, we report a visible light&#8208;responsive hydrogel that showed a rapid, reversible sol/gel phase transition despite its relatively high mechanical properties (storage modulus ~103&#8197;Pa). To construct its 3D crosslinked network, we used a design strategy analogous to that employed for our highly water&#8208;rich yet mechanically robust nanocomposite supramolecular hydrogel (&#8220;aqua material&#8221;). In this case, multiple poly(ethylene glycol) chains carrying ortho&#8208;tetramethoxyazobenzene termini (AzoPEG) were noncovalently crosslinked by clay nanosheets (CNSs) with surface&#8208;immobilized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin units using their seven guanidinium ion (Gu+) pendants (GuCD) via a multivalent salt&#8208;bridge. When exposed to visible light at 625 and 450&#8197;nm, the azobenzene termini isomerized from trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis and cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, respectively, and were detached from and attached to the surface&#8208;immobilized GuCD units. The advantage of this CNS&#8208;based nanocomposite supramolecular system is its simple 3D network structure, which forms and breaks rapidly without slow chain entangling and disentangling processes.

         <title>Polar Order in a Fluid Like Ferroelectric with a Tilted Lamellar Structure &#8211; Observation of a Polar Smectic C (SmCP) Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral smectic C liquid crystals (SmC*) require a chiral centre in the molecular structure and result in a spontaneous polarisation significantly lower than solid state ferroelectrics. Here we present the discovery of a non&#8208;chiral SmC liquid crystal which forms a longitudinally ferroelectric phase with polarisation two orders of magnitude larger than &#8220;classic&#8221; ferroelectric SmC* materials.







Abstract
The discovery of fluid states of matter with spontaneous bulk polar order is appreciated as a major discovery in the fields of soft matter and liquid crystals. Typically, this manifests as polar order superimposed atop conventional phase structures and is thus far limited to orthogonal phase types. Here we report a family of materials which exhibit a previously unseen state of matter which we conclude is a polar smectic C phase, and so we term it SmCP. The spontaneous polarisation of the SmCP phase is over two orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional ferroelectric SmC phase of chiral materials used in some LCD devices. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations faithfully and spontaneously reproduce the proposed structure and associated bulk properties; comparison of experimental and simulated X&#8208;ray scattering patterns shows excellent agreement. The materials disclosed here have significantly smaller dipole moments than typical polar liquid crystals such as RM734 which suggests the role of molecular electrical polarity in generating polar order is perhaps overstated, a view supported by consideration of other molecular systems.

         <title>Fast Production of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Covalent Enzyme Immobilization with Boosted Enzymatic Catalysis by Solar&#8208;Driven Photothermal Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of robust &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine covalent organic frameworks is prepared in minutes attributed to intramolecular hydrogen bond activation. Abundant hydroxyl groups on the pore wall can be facilely post&#8208;modified to covalently immobilize lipase, which showed boosted enzymatic catalysis by solar&#8208;driven photothermal effect.







Abstract
Developing new enzyme&#8208;immobilization systems to stabilize their dynamic structures and meanwhile enhance their catalytic activity is of great significance but very challenging. Herein, we design and fabricate a class of robust mesoporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction.

         <title>A Supramolecular Approach to Engineering Living Cells with Enzymes for Adaptive and Recyclable Cascade Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating live cells with supramolecular polymers through electrostatic interactions created SupraBAC, a bacteria more resilient to environmental stresses. Host&#8208;guest interactions then enabled the ready immobilization of enzymes on SupraBAC for efficient and recyclable multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions. This approach both enhances the stability and recyclability of biocatalysts, while also offering a sustainable approach for complex chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Biocatalytic transformation in nature is inherently dynamic, spontaneous, and adaptive, enabling complex chemical synthesis and metabolism. These processes often involve supramolecular recognition among cells, enzymes, and biomacromolecules, far surpassing the capabilities of isolated cells and enzymes used in industrial synthesis. Inspired by nature, here we design a supramolecular approach to equip living cells with these capacities, enabling recyclable, efficient cascade reactions. Our two&#8208;step &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; methodology begins by coating Escherichia coli cells with guest&#8208;containing polymers (SupraBAC) via supramolecular charge interactions, followed by the introduction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized host enzymes through host&#8208;guest chemistry, creating a robust cell&#8208;enzyme complex. This supramolecular coating not only protects cells from various stresses, such as UV radiation, heat, and organic solvents, but also facilitates the overexpression of intracellular enzymes and the attachment of extracellular enzymes within and on SupraBAC. This combination results in efficient multienzyme cascade synthesis, enabling two&#8208; and three&#8208;step reactions in one pot. Importantly, the multienzyme system can be recycled up to five times without significant loss of activity. Our findings introduce a versatile, adaptive supramolecular coating for whole&#8208;cell catalysts, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for complex synthesis in both chemistry and industrial biotechnology.

         <title>Unravelling the Crucial of Spatial Al Distribution to Realize Precise Alkali&#8208;Treatment for Target Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Undesirable changes (increase, no change, or decrease) in Br&#246;nsted acid densities were always illustrated in alkali&#8208;treated zeolites, which offset the advantage of improved diffusivity during acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In this context, the crucial roles of spatial aluminum distributions in the modulation of zeolite acidity were unraveled. Finally, a precise alkali&#8208;treatment of zeolites was proposed for better catalytic performance.







Abstract
Constructing mesoporous structure within zeolites by alkali&#8208;treatment is an effective protocol to improve their diffusion properties. However, undesirable changes in Br&#246;nsted acid site (BAS) densities always offset this advantage in acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In this context, the crucial roles of spatial aluminum (Al) distribution were unraveled during alkali&#8208;treatment of MFI zeolite and the desirable BAS density was achieved in obtained hierarchical samples for the target reactions. Various characterization methods, particularly the multiple one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR techniques, were performed to track the alkali&#8208;treatment processes. For the sample with a more uniform spatial Al distribution, more tetrahedral Al sites would fall off and migrate around the Si&#8208;OH in zeolite as Al(OH)4&#8722;. Those re&#8208;deposited Al(OH)4&#8722; sites were easily transformed into NMR&#8208;invisible Al sites during the calcination process, which contributed negligibly to both Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acidities, thus being referred to &#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221; Al species. While most tetrahedral Al sites were preserved after the alkali&#8208;treatment of sample with non&#8208;uniform Al distribution and the BAS density gradually increased with treatment time. According to the requirements of typical acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as catalytic cracking of 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene and methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins, the desired hierarchical zeolite catalysts were developed by matching the amounts of extracted Si and generated &#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221; Al during the precise alkali&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Ferroelectric Dipoles Tailoring Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Chemistry to Enable Reversible Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) is assembled with reduced graphene oxide, the strong electronegativity on anode surface would stimulate nearby BTO particles, triggering specific polarization switching of their surface dipoles, resulting in a directional and enhanced polarization electric field, during the Li plating. Attributed to electrostatic interactions, the favorable polarization electric field generated on BTO surface could continuously introduce anions into the Helmholtz layer, allowing more targeted anions (TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722;) to degrade and participate in the subsequent construction of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). As expected, the superior SEIs derived from anions are formed.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a decisive role in building reliable Li metal batteries. However, the scarcity of anions in Helmholtz layer (HL) caused by electrostatic repulsion usually leads to the inferior SEI derived from solvents, resulting in dendrites and &#8216;dead&#8217; Li. Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions&#8208;derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO&#8208;BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; into anion&#8208;defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO&#8208;BTO (10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700&#8197;h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P&#8776;6.3) using rGO&#8208;BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0&#8201;% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.

         <title>Mineralizing Biofilm towards Sustainable Conversion of Plastic Wastes to Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenetical CdS nanoparticles were integrated with Shewanella oneidensis biofilm to be capable of sustainable plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen production under the air. The upper section of the Figure illustrates the process of mineralized biofilm formation, and the lower section depicts the hydrogen production procedure from the mineralized biofilm through plastic degradation.







Abstract
The integration of inorganic materials with biological machinery to convert plastics into fuels offers a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. Herein, we develop a type of hybrid living material via biomineralization of CdS onto Shewanella oneidensis&#8208;based biofilm, which is capable of sustainable hydrogen production from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) wastes under daylight. We reveal that the formed biofilm microstructure provides an independent anaerobic microenvironment that simultaneously supports cellular viability, maintains hydrogenase activity, and preserves the functional stability of CdS, giving rise to the efficient plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency as high as 3751&#8197;&#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA.

&lt;p&gt;Biogenetical CdS nanoparticles were integrated with &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; biofilm to be capable of sustainable plastic-to-hydrogen production under the air. The upper section of the Figure illustrates the process of mineralized biofilm formation, and the lower section depicts the hydrogen production procedure from the mineralized biofilm through plastic degradation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of inorganic materials with biological machinery to convert plastics into fuels offers a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. Herein, we develop a type of hybrid living material via biomineralization of CdS onto &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt;-based biofilm, which is capable of sustainable hydrogen production from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) wastes under daylight. We reveal that the formed biofilm microstructure provides an independent anaerobic microenvironment that simultaneously supports cellular viability, maintains hydrogenase activity, and preserves the functional stability of CdS, giving rise to the efficient plastic-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency as high as 3751&#8197;&#956;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; g-1 PLA. Besides, by genetically engineering transmembrane pili conduit and incorporating conductive nanomaterials to strengthen the electron transfer across cellular interface and biofilm matrices, we show that the conversion efficiency is further enhanced to 5862&#8197;&#956;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; g-1 PLA. Significantly, we exhibit that a long-term sustainable plastic-to-hydrogen conversion of 63 d could be achieved by periodically replenishing PLA wastes. Overall, by the synergistic integration of biotic-abiotic characteristics the developed biofilm-based biomineralized hybrid living material is anticipated to provide a new platform toward the efficient conversion of plastic wastes into valuable fuels, and bridge the gap between environmental contamination and green energy production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Perchlorate Activation Enabled by a Dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the perchlorate activation process in microbes, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex was developed in this work to facilitate the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate through the cooperation of bimetallic centers. With the aid of photoirradiation, the oxidative potential of perchlorate could be released in a controllable manner to achieve the homocoupling of hydrocarbon substrates.







Abstract
Perchlorate, initially regarded as a weakly coordinating counterion rather than a reactive oxidizing reagent due to its kinetic stability, has garnered attention for its potential in microbial systems. Under anaerobic conditions, microbes utilize perchlorate as a terminal oxidant for methane oxidation, involving two distinct stages: extraction and release of oxidizing ability. This two&#8208;phase activation process necessitates the collaborative action of multiple enzymes, a phenomenon not extensively explored in artificial systems. To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex 1 was designed to enable the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8722;Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product 5 was identified as the major product in this C&#8722;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8722;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8722;C coupling product, achieving the complete two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high&#8208;valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.

         <title>Interception of Alkynyl Tetracoordinate Borons with Sulfur Electrophiles beyond the Zweifel Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of intriguing transformations of alkynyl tetracoordinate boron compounds upon reaction with sulfur electrophiles are disclosed, in which substituted benzothiophenes, five/four&#8208;membered boracycles, and alkenyl sulfides are readily assembled under mild reaction conditions. These transformations feature novel reaction modes as well as unusual reaction mechanisms and provide valuable products with high efficiency.







Abstract
Zweifel reaction is a powerful strategy to construct olefins from alkenyl tetracoordinate borons in organoboron chemistry, however, it usually only involves one functional group migration and then undergoes an elimination process affording alkenes or alkynes exclusively. Herein, we disclose several intriguing interception of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons with sulfur electrophiles. Wherein, the substituted benzothiophenes are accessed by consecutive 1,2&#8208;migrations and intramolecular electrophilic substitution, meanwhile, the challenging and elusive five/four&#8208;membered boracycles are easily assembled, and an approach to alkenyl sulfides with good stereoselectivity was developed as well. Moreover, by adding readily available deuterium sources, the tetrasubstituted deuterated alkenyl sulfides with high deuteration rates are constructed. These protocols not only improve atom economy by prohibiting the elimination of Zweifel intermediate, but also enrich the reaction modes of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons achieving versatile value&#8208;added sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that dichlorosulfoxide (SOCl2) and dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride&#8208;type reagents (DAST&#8208;type) as surfur sources could promote dual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons, which are distinct from traditional Zweifel reaction, and the regulation of steric hindrance could also make four&#8208;membered boracycles and alkenyl sulfides feasible. And these transformations feature novel reaction modes and unusual reaction mechanisms with valuable products in high efficiency.

         <title>Regulating Electric Double Layer via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Stable Solid/Electrolyte Interphase on Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation structure in the electric double layer (close to the Mg metal interface) is effectively modulated by self&#8208;assembled monolayer through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions in the magnesium conventional electrolyte. A stable and dense solid electrolyte interphase is induced to solve the interfacial stability problem.







Abstract
Modulating the cationic solvation structure with high donor&#8208;number (DN) additive is an effective strategy to construct a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Mg anode, which necessitates meticulous consideration of electrolyte chemistry and substantial quantities of additives. Notably, the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to anode is pivotal role in SEI formation yet remains understudied. In this study, we propose a novel self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy by utilizing (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFTMS, only 2&#8197;vol&#8201;%, 1.4&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 0.135&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1), a low DN but strong Mg metal absorbability through electron&#8208;withdrawing groups(&#8722;CF3), to modulate the complex structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane. Through dipole&#8208;dipole interaction between the electronegative fluorine (&#8722;CF3 of TFTMS) and electropositive hydrogen (&#8722;CH3/&#8722;CH2 of solvents), TFTMS weakens solvent&#8208;Mg2+ coordination and thus enhances anion&#8208;Mg2+ interaction, inducing a stable and dense SEI with superior electronic insulation to realize horizontal Mg plating/stripping. Consequently, the designed electrolytes enable the symmetric cells to cycle stable for up to 1000&#8197;hours and reversible Mg plating/stripping under 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, they show favorable compatibility with various cathodes. More importantly, the SAM strategy has good generality in other electrolyte systems, demonstrating a simple and effective route to promote the practical application of rechargeable magnesium battery.

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emitting Copper(I) Indenediyltrisphosphine Complexes with Minimized Skeletal Vibrations and Configurational Disorder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission is sometimes given less attention in the design of emissive materials. While emission maxima typically garner attention, broad FWHM values&#8208;especially in the red region&#8208;can shift the perceived color toward orange or yellow. To address this, we incorporated a rigid metallaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes, achieving deep&#8208;red emission with a narrow FWHM of 56&#8197;nm and color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram.







Abstract
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission spectra, which plays an important role in determining color purity, may not always receive sufficient attention in the design of emissive materials. Particularly for the red emitter, the traditional focus has been on emission maxima, yet broad FWHM values can significantly change the perceived color. For example, the red color (&#955;em=616&#8211;677&#8197;nm) emitted from reported Cu(I) complexes is perceived as orange to yellow if FWHM is large. To reduce FWHM, we incorporated a strained and rigid metalaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes using trisphosphine ligands featuring a 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl backbone (ITP). Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and emission properties of ITP&#8208;MX and the congeners, showcasing genuinely deep&#8208;red emission with narrow FWHM values of 56&#8197;nm. These materials exhibit color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram, unlike reported broader&#8208;emitting counterparts. Measurement of the entropy of disorder of the emissive crystal by a recently reported statistical mechanical method revealed a quantitative correlation between FWHM and the increase in the number of microstates (the degree of freedom) of the crystals and suggested that mechanical stress can increase the entropy of the crystal, which results in emission broadening.

To address this, we incorporated a rigid metallaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes, achieving deep-red emission with a narrow FWHM of 56&#8197;nm and color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission spectra, which plays an important role in determining color purity, may not always receive sufficient attention in the design of emissive materials. Particularly for the red emitter, the traditional focus has been on emission maxima, yet broad FWHM values can significantly change the perceived color. For example, the red color (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=616&#8211;677&#8197;nm) emitted from reported Cu(I) complexes is perceived as orange to yellow if FWHM is large. To reduce FWHM, we incorporated a strained and rigid metalaphosphadicyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;a,f&lt;/i&gt;]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes using trisphosphine ligands featuring a 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indene-2,3-diyl backbone (&lt;b&gt;ITP&lt;/b&gt;). Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and emission properties of &lt;b&gt;ITP-MX&lt;/b&gt; and the congeners, showcasing genuinely deep-red emission with narrow FWHM values of 56&#8197;nm. These materials exhibit color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram, unlike reported broader-emitting counterparts. Measurement of the entropy of disorder of the emissive crystal by a recently reported statistical mechanical method revealed a quantitative correlation between FWHM and the increase in the number of microstates (the degree of freedom) of the crystals and suggested that mechanical stress can increase the entropy of the crystal, which results in emission broadening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Suppression of Multilayer Ion Migration via Molecular Complexation Strategy toward High&#8208;Performance Regular Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional and universal molecular complexation strategy is developed, which simultaneously stabilizes hole transport layer (HTL), perovskite layer and Ag electrode by the suppression of Li+, I&#8722; and Ag migration via directly incorporating bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl) oxalate (TCPO) into HTL. TCPO&#8208;doped regular device achieves a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.59&#8201;%, which is accompanied by excellent operational stability.







Abstract
The migration and diffusion of Li+, I&#8722; and Ag impedes the realization of long&#8208;term operationally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a multifunctional and universal molecular complexation strategy to simultaneously stabilize hole transport layer (HTL), perovskite layer and Ag electrode by the suppression of Li+, I&#8722; and Ag migration via directly incorporating bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl) oxalate (TCPO) into HTL. Meanwhile, TCPO co&#8208;doping results in enhanced hole mobility of HTL, advantageous energy band alignment and mitigated interfacial defects, thereby leading to facilitated hole extraction and minimized nonradiative recombination losses. TCPO&#8208;doped regular device achieves a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.68&#8201;% (certified 25.59&#8201;%). The unencapsulated TCPO doped devices maintain over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 730&#8197;h of continuous operation under one sun illumination, 2800&#8197;h of storage at 30&#8201;% relative humidity, and 1200&#8197;h of exposure to 65&#8201;&#176;C, which represents one of the best stabilities reported for regular PSCs. This work provides a new approach to enhance the PCE and long&#8208;term stability of PSCs by host&#8211;guest complexation strategy via rational design of multifunctional ligand molecules.

Visualization of the metabolism of glutamine in vivo: Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle. GlutaR, a genetically encoded fluorescence sensor of glutamine, displays excellent selectivity and sensitivity, which enable to report dynamic and precise changes of glutamine levels in cells, live mice, and quantification of free subcellular organelle glutamine concentrations with high spatiotemporal resolution.







Abstract
Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity (R488/405 of ~1000&#8201;%), and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed in situ titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR's ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice in vivo. These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for All&#8208;Carbon Rechargeable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries with Durable Interfacial Chemistry</title>

In this work, we identified that the diluent TTE can effectively weaken the interaction of Li+&#8208;SUL while increasing the interaction of Li+&#8208;FSI&#8722; on the anode surface, and the space&#8208;occupying diluent made an increase of FSI&#8722; proportion without change its density on the cathode surface, which facilitates the ion desolvation and formation of uniform and thin interfaces at both electrodes with elevated contents of inorganic fluorides. Such optimized interfaces can effectively suppress electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and improve electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility at the anode while facilitating charge transfer across the interface.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;based rechargeable dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) based on graphite anode&#8208;cathode combinations have received much attention due to their high resource abundance and low cost. Currently, the practical realization of the batteries is hindered by easy oxidation of the electrolyte at the cathode interface, and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Configuration of a &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte with a high concentration of Li salt is expected to stabilize the electrolyte chemistry versus both electrodes, yet inevitably reduces the mobility of the solvated working ions and increases the cost of the electrolyte. Herein, we propose to build a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte by adding hydrofluoroether as the diluent to reduce the salt content while improving the solvation structure, allowing more anions to enter the inner solvation sheath. The new electrolyte helps to form uniform and thin interfaces, with elevated contents of inorganic fluorides, on both electrodes, which effectively suppress electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and optimize electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility at the anode while facilitating charge transfer across the interface. Consequently, the DIBs with graphite as anode and cathode operate for 3000 cycles and retain a high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.7&#8201;%, highlighting the importance of stable interfacial chemistry in boosting the electrochemical performance of DIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Driven by Multi&#8208;Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) is prepared by mixing ternary ClO4&#8722;&#8208;based salts. Compared with conventional aqueous electrolyte (AqE) and high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (HCE), which have high water activity and big ion clusters, respectively, HEE exhibits reduced free water, small clusters, and multi&#8208;solvation structures. These provide HEE with anti&#8208;freezing properties and high ionic conductivity, enabling sustainable cycling in pouch cells.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, the poor stability and the unfavorable freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder their actual application. Herein, a ternary salts&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn0.2Na0.4Li0.4(ClO4)1.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion&#8208;rich Zn2+ solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the entropy of the electrolyte. As a consequence, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000&#8197;hours and 1500&#8197;hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na0.33V2O5/Zn and polyaniline/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The pouch cells employing HEE deliver promising capacity and stability, even at high mass loading of active materials. This strategy of introducing multiple salts with different cations to construct a high&#8208;entropy environment provides a facile approach for high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs across a wide temperature range.

Compared with conventional aqueous electrolyte (AqE) and high-concentration electrolyte (HCE), which have high water activity and big ion clusters, respectively, HEE exhibits reduced free water, small clusters, and multi-solvation structures. These provide HEE with anti-freezing properties and high ionic conductivity, enabling sustainable cycling in pouch cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, the poor stability and the unfavorable freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder their actual application. Herein, a ternary salts-based high-entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion-rich Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the entropy of the electrolyte. As a consequence, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000&#8197;hours and 1500&#8197;hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn and polyaniline/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The pouch cells employing HEE deliver promising capacity and stability, even at high mass loading of active materials. This strategy of introducing multiple salts with different cations to construct a high-entropy environment provides a facile approach for high-performance and long-lifespan AZMBs across a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Halide Cathode Materials Based on Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Reaction Towards All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

LixFeXx+2 families were designed as high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity cathode materials with 3&#8197;mol e&#8722; transfer based on the intercalation&#8208;conversion coupling reaction mechanism, enabling the catholyte&#8208;free ASSLBs with improved energy densities.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with non&#8208;flammable solid&#8208;state electrolytes offer high energy density and enhanced safety. However, their energy densities are greatly limited by low&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity oxide cathode materials, typically relying on the intercalation&#8208;deintercalation mechanism with a catholyte content of 15&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Here we introduce the LixFeXx+2 (X=Cl, Br) families as high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity alternatives, operating via a 3&#8197;mol e&#8722; transfer intercalation&#8208;conversion coupling reaction. Notably, the catholyte&#8208;free ASSLBs using 95&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiFeCl3 active material delivers a remarkable capacity of 446&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 912&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which surpasses most oxide cathode materials. Of particular interest is the formation of amorphous Fe during the conversion process. The amorphous Fe exhibits high activity, catalyzing the conversion of LiX back to LixFeXx+2, which proves instrumental in realizing reversible intercalation&#8208;conversion reactions. These halide cathode materials represent a significant advancement towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Integrated Electrocatalyst on Oxygen Conversion for Highly Durable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrocatalyst (Co3O4/CoNGDY) with integrated Janus structure for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is in situ constructed through a self&#8208;organized method. The active sites and mechanism are confirmed by in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Aqueous zinc&#8208;air batteries with ultra&#8208;long stability and recoverable modularized cylindrical solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries are achieved.







Abstract
Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for clean energy applications such as rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts have been the focus of great attention by scientists. Here, an innovative and continuous growth method is established to fabricate integrated Janus structure Co3O4/CoNGDY catalyst, which can work for bifunctional oxygen catalytic conversion, achieving highly durable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Embedded in the hydrangea&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY), the Co3O4/CoNGDY is self&#8208;organized by CoNGDY at the NGDY contact sites and Co3O4 at the upper part, in which Co3O4 works as OER catalyst and CoNGDY acts as ORR catalyst. Due to the incomplete charge transfer within integrated structure, NGDY reduces the d&#8208;band center of the Co sites, so the adsorption strength of intermediates is balanced, and the catalytic activity for ORR/OER is increased. The Co3O4/CoNGDY can serve as an efficient air electrode of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. The rechargeable Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based aqueous zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrate excellent performance with a high specific capacity of 746.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extremely long lifetime of more than 5000&#8197;hours. The recoverable modularized cylindrical Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries with a power density of up to 167.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Responsive Artificial Protein&#8211;Protein Communication for Field&#8208;Deployable Cell&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;responsive artificial protein&#8211;protein communication (LIRAC) was developed by redefining the connection between transcription factors (TFs) and CRISPR/Cas enzymes that do not have natural interactions. LIRAC immediately transduces target&#8208;induced TF allostery into fast activation of CRISPR/Cas enzymes within a homogeneous system, allowing for rapid response, tunable dynamic range, tristate logic, and portable detection.







Abstract
Natural protein&#8211;protein communications, such as those between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerases/ribosomes, underpin cell&#8208;free biosensing systems operating on the transcription/translation (TXTL) paradigm. However, their deployment in field analysis is hampered by the delayed response (hour&#8208;level) and the complex composition of in vitro TXTL systems. For this purpose, we present a de novo&#8208;designed ligand&#8208;responsive artificial protein&#8211;protein communication (LIRAC) by redefining the connection between TFs and non&#8208;interacting CRISPR/Cas enzymes. By rationally designing a chimeric DNA adaptor and precisely regulating its binding affinities to both proteins, LIRAC immediately transduces target&#8208;induced TF allostery into rapid CRISPR/Cas enzyme activation within a homogeneous system. Consequently, LIRAC obviates the need for RNA/protein biosynthesis inherent to conventional TXTL&#8208;based cell&#8208;free systems, substantially reducing reaction complexity and time (from hours to 10&#8197;minutes) with improved sensitivity and tunable dynamic range. Moreover, LIRAC exhibits excellent versatility and programmability for rapidly and sensitively detecting diverse contaminants, including antibiotics, heavy metal ions, and preservatives. It also enables the creation of a multi&#8208;protein communication&#8208;based tristate logic for the intelligent detection of multiple contaminants. Integrated with portable devices, LIRAC has been proven effective in the field analysis of environmental samples and personal care products, showcasing its potential for environmental and health monitoring.

         <title>Dual Active Sites with Charge&#8208;asymmetry in Organic Semiconductors Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces N vacancies and O doping dual active sites into organic semiconductors, inducing localized charge polarization that simultaneously promotes C&#8722;C coupling and reduces exciton binding energy in CO2 photoreduction reaction (CO2RR). These dual effects lead to high yields and selectivity of ethanol, the primary product of CO2RR, opening new avenues for efficient photocatalytic processes.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and energy shortage, but it is still highly challenging due to the large energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling step and severe exciton annihilation in photocatalysts. Herein, strong and localized charge polarization is successfully induced on the surface of melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors by creating dual active sites with a large charge asymmetry.

     alt="Dual Active Sites with Charge-asymmetry in Organic Semiconductors Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work introduces N vacancies and O doping dual active sites into organic semiconductors, inducing localized charge polarization that simultaneously promotes C&#8722;C coupling and reduces exciton binding energy in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). These dual effects lead to high yields and selectivity of ethanol, the primary product of CO2RR, opening new avenues for efficient photocatalytic processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction into high-energy-density and high-value-added C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and energy shortage, but it is still highly challenging due to the large energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling step and severe exciton annihilation in photocatalysts. Herein, strong and localized charge polarization is successfully induced on the surface of melon-based organic semiconductors by creating dual active sites with a large charge asymmetry. Confirmed by multiscale characterization and theoretical simulations, such asymmetric charge distribution, originated from the oxygen dopants and nitrogen vacancies over melon-based organic semiconductors, reduces exciton binding energy and boosts exciton dissociation. The as-formed charge polarization sites not only donate electrons to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules but also accelerate the coupling of asymmetric *CO*CO intermediates for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction into ethanol by lowering the energy barrier of this process. Consequently, an exceptionally high selectivity of up to 97&#8201;% for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH yield of 0.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; have been achieved on this dual active sites organic semiconductor. This work, with its potential applicability to a variety of non-metal multi-site catalysts, represents a versatile strategy for the development of advanced catalysts tailored for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytically Active Site Mapping Realized through Energy Transfer Modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

Like a telescope mapping the stars in the sky, resonance energy transfer (RET) offers a window into the world of catalytic &#8220;stars&#8221; nestled within a porous matrix &#8220;sky&#8221;. Integrating catalysts as guests within any porous matrix of a host&#8211;guest catalytic system allows for visualizing active site positions. By mimicking catalysts, fluorescent models pinpoint active sites, while host&#8211;guest systems ensure a &#8242;core&#8211;shell&#8242; distribution, minimizing mass transport effects.







Abstract
The demands of a sustainable chemical industry are a driving force for the development of heterogeneous catalytic platforms exhibiting facile catalyst recovery, recycling, and resilience to diverse reaction conditions. Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst transitions can be realized through the integration of efficient homogeneous catalysts within porous matrices. Herein, we offer a versatile approach to understanding how guest distribution and evolution impact the catalytic performance of heterogeneous host&#8211;guest catalytic platforms by implementing the resonance energy transfer (RET) concept using fluorescent model systems mimicking the steric constraints of targeted catalysts. Using the RET&#8208;based methodology, we mapped condition&#8208;dependent guest (re)distribution within a porous support on the example of modular matrices such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Furthermore, we correlate RET results performed on the model systems with the catalytic performance of two MOF&#8208;encapsulated catalysts used to promote CO2 hydrogenation and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Guests are incorporated using aperture&#8208;opening encapsulation, and catalyst redistribution is not observed under practical reaction conditions, showcasing a pathway to advance catalyst recyclability in the case of host&#8211;guest platforms. These studies represent the first generalizable approach for mapping the guest distribution in heterogeneous host&#8211;guest catalytic systems, providing a foundation for predicting and tailoring the performance of catalysts integrated into various porous supports.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Electron Transport Layer with Internal Encapsulation Capability for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linkable fullerene (BCM) is synthesized and used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). BCM can in situ form a compact cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film that not only effectively transports electrons but also acts as an internal encapsulation layer to suppress the diffusion of perovskite components, thereby achieving high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in PSCs.







Abstract
A stable and compact fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) is crucial for high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, traditional fullerene&#8208;based ETLs like C60 and PCBM are prone to aggregate under operational conditions, a challenge recently recognized by academic and industrial researchers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel cross&#8208;linkable fullerene molecule, bis((3&#8208;methyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl) malonate&#8208;C60 monoadduct (BCM), for use as an ETL in PSCs. Upon a low&#8208;temperature annealing at 100&#8201;&#176;C, BCM undergoes in situ cross&#8208;linking to form a robust cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film, which demonstrates excellent electron mobility and a suitable band structure for efficient PSCs. Our results show that PSCs incorporating CBCM&#8208;based ETL achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.89&#8201;% (certified: 25.36&#8201;%), significantly surpassing the 23.25&#8201;% efficiency of PCBM&#8208;based devices. The intramolecular covalent interactions within CBCM films effectively prevent aggregation and enhance film compactness, creating an internal encapsulation layer that mitigates the decomposition and ion migration of perovskite components. Consequently, CBCM&#8208;based PSCs show exceptional stability, maintaining 97.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking, compared to only 78.6&#8201;% retention in PCBM&#8208;based devices after less than 820&#8197;hours.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired N, O Co&#8208;Coordinated Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom catalyst (Mn CD/C) with MnN2O2 atomic sites on the carbon dots exhibited excellent performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide, owing to the electronic regulation effect of coordination environment and adjacent oxygen functional groups.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a pivotal pathway for the distributed production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In nature, enzymes containing manganese (Mn) centers can convert reactive oxygen species into H2O2. However, Mn&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for 2e&#8722; ORR are scarcely reported. Herein, we developed a nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst comprising N, O co&#8208;coordinated Mn sites, utilizing carbon dots as the modulation platform (Mn CD/C). As&#8208;synthesized Mn CD/C exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.786&#8197;V and a maximum H2O2 selectivity of 95.8&#8201;%. Impressively, Mn CD/C continuously produced 0.1&#8197;M H2O2 solution at 200&#8197;mA/cm2 for 50&#8197;h in the flow cell, with negligible loss in activity and H2O2 faradaic efficiency, demonstrating practical application potential. The enhanced activity was attributed to the incorporation of Mn atomic sites into the carbon dots. Theoretical calculations revealed that the N, O co&#8208;coordinated structure, combined with abundant oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon dots, optimized the binding strength of intermediate *OOH at the Mn sites to the apex of the catalytic activity volcano. This work illustrates that carbon dots can serve as a versatile platform for modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and for the rational design of nature&#8208;inspired catalysts.

         <title>Regulating Interface Dipole Interaction between Ethers and Active Species Toward Highly Stable Li&#8208;SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the dipole interaction between solvent and active species is a pathway to achieve stable cycle performance of batteries. The chain coordination between the monodentate ether solvent PE and active species not only provides excellent Li+ transfer kinetics, but also successfully inhibits the formation of LiPS in SPAN cathode and promotes the formation of stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface. Therefore, the cells with PE&#8208;based electrolyte exhibit outstanding capacity retention and prolonged cycle lifespan.







Abstract
Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is recognized as a promising organic cathode for long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries. Nevertheless, the irreversible cleavage/formation of multiple sulfur&#8208;sulfur (S&#8722;S) bonds of SPAN within conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes results in loss of active S species, severe capacity fading and shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. Benefiting from the particular chain&#8208;coordination structure and weak dipole interactions with Li+ and active species, the resulting electrolyte not only achieves low desolvation energy barrier and high Li+ transference number, but also displays stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface (EEI). Consequently, the full cells utilizing this electrolyte exhibit good cyclability, outstanding capacity retention and superior extreme&#8208;temperature (&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to 50&#8201;&#176;C) performance.

&lt;p&gt;Reducing the dipole interaction between solvent and active species is a pathway to achieve stable cycle performance of batteries. The chain coordination between the monodentate ether solvent PE and active species not only provides excellent Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer kinetics, but also successfully inhibits the formation of LiPS in SPAN cathode and promotes the formation of stable electrolyte-electrode interface. Therefore, the cells with PE-based electrolyte exhibit outstanding capacity retention and prolonged cycle lifespan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is recognized as a promising organic cathode for long-lifespan lithium metal batteries. Nevertheless, the irreversible cleavage/formation of multiple sulfur-sulfur (S&#8722;S) bonds of SPAN within conventional ether-based electrolytes results in loss of active S species, severe capacity fading and shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li-SPAN batteries.

         <title>Hubbard Gap Closure&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Redox Li&#8208;Storage Mechanism as the Origin of Anomalously High Capacity and Fast Ion Diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;Like Polyoxometalates</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism is first decoded as the origin of anomalously high capacity and fast diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;like POM electrode, where enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation, Hubbard gap closure and interlayer conjugated configuration essentially contribute to the high capacity, accelerated rate capability and superior cycle stability.







Abstract
MOFs&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POMs) electrodes, harvesting combined advantages of interlocking porosity and multi&#8208;electron transfer reaction, have already emerged as promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the origins of the underlying redox mechanism in such materials remain a matter of uncertainty. Of critical challenges are the anomalously high storage capacities beyond their theoretical values and the fast ion diffusivity that cannot be satisfactorily comprehended in the theory of crystal lattice. Herein, for the first time we decode t2g electron occupation&#8208;regulated dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism as the true origin of extra capacity in POMs electrodes. The lattice and electronic transition of active centers and reaction intermediates were systematically decoupled through density functional theory (DFT) and a suite of structural spectroscopic investigations, such as X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation by Li coordination significantly triggers the Hubbard gap closure and reversible Li deposition/dissolution at surface region. Conjugated V&#8722;O&#8208;Li configuration at interlayers endow Li+ ion pathways along pore walls as the dominant contribution to the low migration barrier and fast diffusivity. As a result, remarkable cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), extremely high specific capacity (1200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (404&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) were achieved, providing new understandings on the underlying mechanism of POMs electrodes and pivotal guidance for dual&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>A Detailed View on the (Re)isomerization Dynamics in Microbial Rhodopsins Using Complementary Near&#8208;UV and IR Readouts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;UV readout (SBS) in microbial rhodopsins can be used to probe the retinal configuration as well as electrostatic changes associated with the charge translocation during the ion pumping process in real time.







Abstract
Isomerization is a key process in many (bio)chemical systems. In microbial rhodopsins, the photoinduced isomerization of the all&#8208;trans retinal to the 13&#8208;cis isomer initiates a cascade of structural changes of the protein. The interplay between these changes and the thermal relaxation of the isomerized retinal is one of the crucial determinants for rhodopsin functionality. It is therefore important to probe this dynamic interplay with chromophore specific markers that combine gapless temporal observation with spectral sensitivity.
Here we utilize the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region in the framework of a systematic (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic study on H+&#8208; (HsBR, (G)PR), Na+&#8208; (KR2, ErNaR) and Cl&#8722;&#8208;(NmHR) pumps. We demonstrate that the near&#8208;UV region is an excellent probe for retinal configuration and&#8212;being sensitive to the electrostatic environment of retinal&#8212;even transient ion binding, which allows us to pinpoint protein specific mechanistic nuances and chromophore&#8208;charge interactions. The combination of the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region hence provides a spectroscopic analysis tool that allows a detailed, precise and temporally fully resolved description of retinal configurations during all stages of the photocycle.

         <title>Engineering Active Sites of Metal/Metal Oxide Catalysts by Oxide Ligand Overlayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a strategy to engineer active sites of supported Pt catalysts using WOx as stable oxide ligands, which selectively block Pt terraces. Adjusting the WOx coverage tunes the site composition, alters reactant adsorption, and shifts selectivity from the terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated pathways, as evidenced in furfural conversion.







Abstract
Engineering sites of supported metal catalysts is essential to enhancing activity and selectivity. Such enhancement is typically achieved by particle size modification, surface alloying, or attaching molecular ligands. Yet, control strategies for complex, multifunctional molecules and catalysts, where selectivity is crucial, are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that submonolayer WOx with tunable coverage preferentially decorates well&#8208;coordinated Pt terrace sites as a stable ligand. By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first&#8208;principles modeling, we show that the WOx coverage on Pt modifies the metal&#8208;to&#8208;acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal&#8208;acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support&#8208;dependent WOx coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.

         <title>Surface Matrix&#8208;Mediated Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is demonstrated to regulate the composition and surface matrix of PQDs. After cation exchange, the light absorption spectra of PQDs are broadened and the surface matrix integrity of PQDs is improved, substantially eliminating the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination and improving the phase stability for high&#8208;performance solar cells.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dot (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD) is very promising for photovoltaic applications due to its good phase stability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving the CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs with tunable compositions and robust surface matrix remains a challenge. Here, the surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange of PQDs is proposed, in which a bi&#8208;functional molecule, tetrafluoroborate methylammonium (FABF4), is applied for the cation exchange and stabilizing surface matrix of PQDs. The results reveal that the FA+ of FABF4 molecules could exchange the Cs+ of CsPbI3 PQDs forming alloy CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, allowing to tune the spectroscopies of PQDs. Meanwhile, the BF4&#8722; of FABF4 molecules can effectively stabilize the surface lattice and substantially diminish the surface vacancies of PQDs, improving the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. Consequently, CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells deliver an efficiency of up to 17.49&#8201;%, which is the highest value of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. This work provided important design principles for the composition and surface matrix regulation of PQDs for high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

     alt="Surface Matrix-Mediated Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surface matrix-mediated cation exchange strategy of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is demonstrated to regulate the composition and surface matrix of PQDs. After cation exchange, the light absorption spectra of PQDs are broadened and the surface matrix integrity of PQDs is improved, substantially eliminating the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and improving the phase stability for high-performance solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cesium-formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dot (Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD) is very promising for photovoltaic applications due to its good phase stability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving the Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs with tunable compositions and robust surface matrix remains a challenge. Here, the surface matrix-mediated cation exchange of PQDs is proposed, in which a bi-functional molecule, tetrafluoroborate methylammonium (FABF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), is applied for the cation exchange and stabilizing surface matrix of PQDs. The results reveal that the FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of FABF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules could exchange the Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs forming alloy Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs, allowing to tune the spectroscopies of PQDs. Meanwhile, the BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; of FABF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules can effectively stabilize the surface lattice and substantially diminish the surface vacancies of PQDs, improving the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. Consequently, Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells deliver an efficiency of up to 17.49&#8201;%, which is the highest value of Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells.

         <title>Terminal Fluorination Modulates Crystallinity and Aggregation of Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal fluorination enhances crystallinity and J&#8208;aggregate ratio of the non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptor TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, surpassing its chlorinated version. Thus, TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based organic photodetectors exhibit suppressed nonradiative energy loss and more ordered active layer morphology, leading to an ultralow dark current density of 7.30&#215;10&#8208;12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exceptional detectivity over 1013 Jones in 320&#8211;920&#8197;nm wavelength, along with excellent stability.







Abstract
High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, which features fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J&#8208;aggregation compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs with lower nonradiative energy loss, improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self&#8208;powered OPDs exhibit a 40&#8208;fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl&#8208;based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra&#8208;low Jd of 7.30&#215;10&#8208;12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320&#8211;920&#8197;nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#215;1014 Jones at 800&#8197;nm for the TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material&#8208;based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Reducing Dead Species by Electrochemically&#8208;Densified Cathode&#8208;Interface&#8208;Reaction Layer towards High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Endurable Zn||I&#8208;Br Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL) is electrochemically formed in Br&#8722;&#8208;concentrated electrolytes, which remarkably reduces the &#8220;dead species&#8221; phenomena usually present in diluted electrolytes, enabling Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries involving interhalogen conversion with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability.







Abstract
Interhalogen&#8208;involved aqueous Zn||halogen batteries (AZHBs) are latent high&#8208;energy systems for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet usually suffer from poor high&#8208;rate endurability caused by the formation of &#8220;dead species&#8221;. Herein, via an electrochemically&#8208;densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL), Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries involving interhalogen reactions between the I2 cathode and Br&#8722; from the electrolytes are initially achieved with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability. Different from that in diluted electrolytes, the CIRL formed in Br&#8722;&#8208;concentrated electrolyte is denser and water&#8208;lean, which enables halogen species conversion with a more rapid charge transfer and lower activation energy. More importantly, the CIRL robustly affords a decent I2 conservation by accelerated conversion kinetics and limited species diffusion, thereby endowing the Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries with an ultralong high&#8208;rate lifespan. The electrochemical mechanism is sufficiently verified by multiple spectral characterizations. Consequently, Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries in Br&#8722;&#8208;concentrated (20&#8197;m) electrolytes exhibit an overwhelming rate capability and lifespan to those in Br&#8722;&#8208;diluted (2&#8197;m) electrolytes. Typically, when cycled at a large current density of 10&#8197;A g&#8722;1, an ultralong lifespan of over 25,000 cycles is achieved with a high retention of 98.3&#8201;%. This study provides new insight into the CIRL&#8208;dictated active species conservation for high&#8208;rate endurable AZHBs, which could apply to other high&#8208;energy interhalogen batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption Kinetics and Capacity of a Stable CeF3@Ni3N Heterostructure for Methanol Electro&#8208;Reforming Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable CeF3@Ni3N heterostructure with abundant interfaces is fabricated, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and stability under industrial current density for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production. CeF3@Ni3N heterostructure can adjust electron distribution and modulate surface adsorption kinetics/capability of methanol and OH&#8722;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Alkaline methanol&#8208;water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro&#8208;reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy&#8208;consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)2 lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH&#8722;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43&#8197;V at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, along with high stability over 72&#8197;h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76&#8197;mV to achieve 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane&#8208;free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long&#8208;term stability and FEs at high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.

Furthermore, membrane-free CeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/CC||CeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability and FEs at high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Increasing the Donor Strength of Alkenylphosphines by Twisting the C=C Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent in the backbone (sNHOP) is reported, in which the olefin moiety is twisted to break the &#960;&#8208;interaction. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to an increased donor strength of the phosphines and thus in enhanced catalytic activities in gold(I) catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phosphines play a crucial role in transition metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysis. While alkyl groups have traditionally been employed to increase the phosphine donor strength, recent studies have shown that zwitterionic functional groups such as phosphorus ylides can result in a further enhancement. Herein we report the concept of twisting a C=C double bond to introduce a zwitterionic substituent by the synthesis and application of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent (sNHOP). This sulfonyl group enables the twisting of the olefin moiety due to steric and electronic stabilization of the carbanionic center. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to a significant increase of the donor strength of the sNHOP ligands compared to conventional NHOP systems with a planar N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin moiety. The potential of this new ligand platform for catalysis is demonstrated by its application in the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cyclo&#8208;isomerization of alkynes. Here, the ligands outperform the original NHOP ligands suggesting favorable properties for future catalysis applications.

         <title>Vertically Expanded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation into Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically expanded covalent organic frameworks are constructed via one&#8208;pot reaction to merge two&#8208;dimensional covalent polygonal skeletons with spatially expanded layers separated by molecular pillars. The resultant frameworks expose all sites in layers to catalysis, improve exciton dissociation, increase oxidation potential, and facilitate water delivery, achieving exceptional activities in photocatalytic water oxidation into oxygen.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks with unique &#960; architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form &#960;&#8208;stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot polymerization. The resultant frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is even 5.1&#8208;fold as high as that of the &#960;&#8208;stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized the stereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of bicyclobutanes via radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, which constitutes a practical method to assemble fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes. It is noteworthy that the covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy achieved diastereoselective radical&#8208;radical cross coupling, with dispersion and electrostatic interactions playing a crucial role in stereoinduction.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.

         <title>Energy Dissipation and Toughening of Covalent Networks via a Sacrificial Conformation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the concept of sacrificial conformation, demonstrating that &#946;&#8208;CD act as sacrificial conformation, enabling energy dissipation through force&#8208;induced conformational changes and resulting in a significant enhancement of mechanical performance. Furthermore, we elucidated the microscale force&#8208;responsive nature of &#946;&#8208;CD through CoGEF simulations and investigated their practical role in macroscopic materials using stress relaxation approach on a strain&#8208;controlled rotational rheometer.







Abstract
Covalent polymer networks find wide utility in diverse engineering applications owing to their desirable stiffness and resilience. However, the rigid covalent chemical structure between crosslinking points imposes limitations on enhancing their toughness. Although the incorporation of sacrificial chemical bonds has shown promise in improving toughness through energy dissipation, composite networks struggle to maintain both rapid recovery and stiffness. Consequently, a significant challenge persists in achieving a covalent network that combines high strength, stiffness, toughness, and fast recovery performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sacrificial structure termed &#8220;sacrificial conformation.&#8221; In this approach, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is covalently embedded into the network skeleton as the sacrificial conformation element. Compared to traditional covalent networks (LCN), well&#8208;designed cyclodextrin&#8208;embedded covalent network (CCN) exhibit a 100&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus and a 60&#8208;fold increase in toughness. Importantly, CCN maintains excellent elasticity, ensuring swift recovery after deformation. This sacrificial conformational strategy enables efficient energy dissipation without necessitating the rupture of chemical bonds, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. This advancement holds great promise for the design and fabrication of advanced elastomers and hydrogels with superior mechanical properties and dynamic behavior.

         <title>Localized Water Restriction in Ternary Eutectic Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hydrogen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a low&#8208;temperature eutectic electrolyte for hydrogen batteries. Using high DN co&#8208;solvents (DMSO) precisely controls hydrogen bonds and locally restricts free water, creating a new ternary eutectic electrolyte. This optimized electrolyte reduces water side effects and enables stable operation under extreme conditions, including high current density (25&#8201;&#176;C, 60&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low temperatures (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Proton batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage in extreme conditions due to the small ionic radius and efficient transport of protons. Hydrogen gas, with its low working potentials, fast kinetics, and stability, further enhances the performance of proton batteries but necessitates the development of novel electrolytes with low freezing points and reduced corrosion. This work introduces a localized water restriction strategy by incorporating a tertiary component with a high donor number, which forms strong bonds with water molecules. This approach restricts free water molecules and reduces the average hydrogen bond ratio and strength. As&#8208;prepared ternary eutectic electrolytes lowered the freezing point to &#8722;103&#8201;&#176;C, significantly lower than the traditional binary electrolyte (9.5&#8197;m H3PO4, &#8722;93&#8201;&#176;C). This electrolyte is highly compatible with the Cu0.79Co0.21[Fe(CN)6]0.64&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (CoCuHCF) cathode, reducing material dissolution and current collector corrosion. The H2||CoCuHCF battery using this electrolyte demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 23664.3&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, excellent performance at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C, and stable cyclability over 1000&#8197;cycles (&gt;30&#8197;days) at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. These findings provide a framework for proton electrolytes, highlighting the potential of hydrogen batteries in challenging environments.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activable Charge Transfer Agents for Synergistic Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanosystem (PBND NP) demonstrates strong intermolecular charge transfer effect, efficient NIR light absorption capability and enhanced intersystem crossing. As a result, PBND NP showcases a remarkable inhibition on both primary and distant tumors through photoimmunotherapy.







Abstract
The combination of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become an attractive tumor treatment modality, yet the facile design of photoimmunotheranostic agents with efficient near infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbing and immune&#8208;activating capabilities remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we developed a NIR&#8208;activable organic charge transfer complex (CTC), with perylene (PER) as the electron donor and 4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrabromoisochromeno [6,5,4&#8208;def]isochromene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraone (Br4NDI) as the electron acceptor. Through further supramolecular assembly, the PER&#8208;Br4NDI nanoparticle (PBND NP) for spatiotemporally controlled photoimmunotherapy was constructed. The PBND NP exhibits superb NIR absorption, robust intermolecular charge transfer, and enhanced intersystem crossing. Upon NIR photoirradiation, the PBND NP effectively exerts photothermal and photodynamic effects with a remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 63.5&#8201;% and a high reactive oxygen species generation capability, which not only directly ablates primary tumors, but also dramatically suppresses distant tumor growth via promoted immunogenic cell death. Moreover, programmed cell death protein 1 antibody acts synergistically to block immune evasion and ultimately enhances cancer treatment efficacy. This work therefore sheds light on the design of organic CTCs for synergistic photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Orderly Coating of Bilayer Polymer to Tailor Microenvironment for Efficient C&#8722;N Coupling Toward Highly Selective Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient C&#8722;N coupling toward highly selective urea electrosynthesis is achieved via orderly coating of bilayer polymer on the electrocatalyst surface, with upper polymer featuring hydrophobicity to achieve certain repulsion of electrolyte and effectively inhibit the HER, while underlying polymer serving as CO2 concentrator to facilitate the carbon source supply for C&#8722;N coupling.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of urea from co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate is a promising alternative to the industrial process. However, the overwhelming existence of proton and nitrate as well as the insufficient supply of CO2 at the reaction interface usually result in complex product distributions from individual nitrate reduction or hydrogen evolution, instead of C&#8722;N coupling. In this work, we systematically optimize this microenvironment through orderly coating of bilayer polymer to specifically tackle the above challenges. Polymer of intrinsic microporosity is chosen as the upper polymer to achieve physical sieving, realizing low water diffusivity for suppressing hydrogen evolution and high gas permeability for smooth mass transfer of CO2 at the same time. Polyaniline with abundant basic amino groups is capable of triggering chemical interaction with acidic CO2 molecules, so that is used as the underlying polymer to serve as CO2 concentrator and facilitate the carbon source supply for C&#8722;N coupling. Within this tailored microenvironment, a maximum urea generation yield rate of 1671.6&#8197;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of 75.3&#8201;% are delivered once coupled with efficient electrocatalyst with neighboring active sites, which is among the most efficient system of urea electrosynthesis.

A stable dicyclopenta[4,3,2,1&#8208;cde:4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8208;pqr]&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was successfully synthesized that shows global anti&#8208;aromaticity with small diradical character. The dication exhibits an open&#8208;shell diradical character and a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure, while the dianion is a closed&#8208;shell singlet in the ground state and displays a diatropic ring current on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated periphery.







Abstract
We report a robust strategy for tuning the electronic structure and chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs). By fusing two cyclopentadienyl rings in the peri&#8208;tetracene bay regions, we introduce antiaromatic character into the &#960;&#8208;system, leading to unique photophysical and electronic properties. A stable mesityl&#8208;substituted dicyclopenta&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was synthesized through stepwise formylation/intramolecular cyclization at the bay regions of the dihydro peri&#8208;tetracene precursor, followed by oxidative dehydrogenation. This compound features an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, global antiaromaticity, exceptional stability under ambient conditions, and amphoteric redox behavior with a small energy gap. Its dication also possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and its structure was identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, revealing a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure. In contrast, the dianion exhibits a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state. This work provides valuable insights for designing and synthesizing novel open&#8208;shell PHs with tunable electronic structures and remarkable stability.

         <title>Stable and Recyclable Copper Nanoclusters with Exposed Active Sites for Broad&#8208;Scope Protosilylation in Open Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of maleonitriledithiolate ligands allows for the straightforward synthesis of stable, atomically precise Cu6 nanoclusters with exposed copper active sites in gram scales. These recyclable cluster&#8208;based copper catalysts efficiently promote the protosilylation of C&#8722;C multiple bonds under ambient conditions, with a broad substrate scope and high turnover numbers, demonstrating their considerable promise for practical synthetic applications.







Abstract
Despite recent advances in cluster&#8208;based catalysis for organic synthesis, the substrate scope of reactions catalyzed by metal nanoclusters is typically not superior to previously established catalytic systems. Herein, we develop new atomically precise copper nanoclusters for protosilylation, with scope expanding to alkenes and simple enynes that were not suitable for prior synthetic methodologies with traditional copper complexes. The involvement of a second copper center in the metal kernel during the migratory insertion step is thought to be responsible for the expanded scope. In addition, the reaction is highly compatible with water and can be carried out in open air rather than under inert gas protection. Mechanistic studies suggest that the cluster&#8208;catalyzed protosilylation proceeds in the absence of silyl radicals. The current findings demonstrate the potential of using metal nanoclusters for practical and sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Dynamically Confined Active Silver Nanoclusters with Ultrawide Operating Temperature Window in CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO oxidation reaction environment including O2 and H2O can afford dynamic adsorbates on metal surface and OH sites at metal/support interface to stabilize Ag nanoclusters. Dynamic confinement enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit high activity over a wide temperature window of 25&#8208;500&#8201;&#176;C under dry condition and 200&#8208;800&#8201;&#176;C under wet condition for CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Supported metal nanoclusters are often highly active in many catalytic reactions but less stable particularly under harsh reaction conditions. Here, we demonstrate that this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off can be efficiently broken through rational design of surrounding microenvironment of the supported nanocatalyst including gas adsorbate overlayer and underneath support surface chemistry. Our studies reveal that chemisorbed oxygen species on Ag surface and surface hydroxyl groups on oxide support, which are dynamically consumed during reaction but sustained by reaction environment (O2 and H2O vapor), drive spontaneous redispersion of Ag particles and stabilization of highly active Ag nanoclusters. Such a dynamic confinement effect from gas&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support interaction enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit complete catalytic oxidation of CO over a wide temperature window of 25&#8208;500&#8201;&#176;C under dry conditions and 200&#8208;800&#8201;&#176;C under wet conditions as well as remarkable stability at 300&#8201;&#176;C over 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Chirality Transfer in the Superbundles of Sequence&#8208;defined Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The availability of well&#8208;defined discrete stereoisomers enables the exploration of the effect of stereochemical sequence on supramolecular chirality. The sequence&#8208;defined stereoisomers show different phenomena of activation and deactivation of chirality transfer.







Abstract
Discrete oligomers can be used to precisely evaluate the structure&#8211;property relationship and enable unique chiroptical activities, however, the role of stereochemical sequences on chirality transfer is still unclear. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a series of sequence&#8208;defined chiral azobenzene (Azo) oligomers via iterative stepwise chain growth strategy. Sequence&#8208;defined stereoisomers with one single chiral (L or D) stereocenter at the &#945;&#8208;position, &#969;&#8208;position and middle&#8208; (m&#8722;) position have completely different self&#8208;assembly dynamics. &#969;&#8208;positional stereocenter can effectively command all Azo building blocks to adopt a tilted &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking along the helical superbundles, exhibiting the activation of chirality transfer. However, discrete oligomers with the stereocenter at other positions can only self&#8208;assemble into non&#8208;helical nanowires, accompanied by the deactivation of chirality transfer.Cooperative supramolecular interactions, including the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between Azo units, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, are intrinsic driving forces for these differentiations.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Flexibility of Chiral Organic Crystals with Highly Efficient Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chiral flexible organic crystals that are mechanically flexible in two directions, at both 77 K and room temperature. Both the straight and bent region exhibit highly efficient second harmonic generation.







Abstract
Flexible crystals with unique mechanical properties have presented potential for applications in optoelectronics, soft robotics and sensors. However, there have been no reports of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant flexible crystals with second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties (NLO). Here, we report flexible chiral Schiff&#8208;base crystals capable of efficient second harmonic generation (SHG). Both enantiomers and the racemic form of these crystals are mechanically flexible in two directions at both room temperature and at 77 K, although their mechanical responses differ. The enantiomers display SHG with an intensity of up to 12 times that of potassium dihydrogenphosphate (KDP) when pumped at 980&#8197;nm, and they also have high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT). Even when bent, the crystals retain strong second harmonic generation, although with a different intensity distribution depending on the polarization, compared to when they are straight. This work describes the first instance of flexible organic single&#8208;crystalline material with NLO properties and lays the foundation for the development of mechanically flexible organic NLO materials.

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Based on a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer towards Amplified Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral co&#8208;assemblies responsive to acid and thermal stimuli were prepared based on R/S&#8208;5011 and polymer PFIQ containing iso&#8208;quinoline. The chiral co&#8208;assemblies showed tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with high |glum| values of up to 0.3. Furthermore, the chiral co&#8208;assemblies induced achiral emitters to generate full&#8208;color CPL signals through CPL energy transfer, with the corresponding |glum| values above 0.2.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have been attaching wide attention in the field of optical information storage and encryption, while still facing the challenge of the realization of high luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). This work presents a pair of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral co&#8208;assemblies P7R3 and P7S3 by combining polymer PFIQ containing iso&#8208;quinoline units with chiral inducers. The obtained chiral co&#8208;assemblies can reversibly undergo significant modification in CPL behavior under trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) fumigation and annealing treatment, with the |glum| values exhibiting a reversible shift between 0.2 and 0.3. Moreover, the chiral co&#8208;assemblies before TFA fumigating can effectively induce achiral emitters to generate intense full&#8208;color CPL signals through CPL energy transfer (CPL&#8208;ET), with the corresponding |glum| values larger than 0.2. Moreover, information encryption and decryption as well as a multi&#8208;level logic gates application are achieved by leveraging the reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL activity of the chiral co&#8208;assembly. This work provides a new perspective for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral luminescent materials with large |glum| values and the activation of CPL behavior in achiral emitters.

&lt;i&gt;|&lt;/i&gt; values exhibiting a reversible shift between 0.2 and 0.3. Moreover, the chiral co-assemblies before TFA fumigating can effectively induce achiral emitters to generate intense full-color CPL signals through CPL energy transfer (CPL-ET), with the corresponding |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| values larger than 0.2. Moreover, information encryption and decryption as well as a multi-level logic gates application are achieved by leveraging the reversible stimuli-responsive CPL activity of the chiral co-assembly. This work provides a new perspective for the construction of stimuli-responsive chiral luminescent materials with large |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| values and the activation of CPL behavior in achiral emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Weaving Towards Flexible Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a molecular weaving strategy to assembling hydroxyl polymers and 2D COF nanosheets into gas separation membranes. Electrostatic interactions drive hydroxyl chains into COF pores, enhancing flexibility, strength, and reducing pore size. This, combined with CO2 sorption sites, gives the PVA@TpPa&#8722;SO3H membrane exceptional H2 permeance (1267.3 GPU) and H2/CO2 selectivity (43). This strategy is promising for large&#8208;scale fabrication of COF&#8208;based membranes for small gas separations.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit considerable potential in gas separations owing to their remarkable stability and tunable pore structures. Nevertheless, their application as gas separation membranes is hindered by limited size&#8208;sieving capabilities and poor processability. In this study, we propose a novel molecular weaving strategy that combines hydroxyl polymers and 2D TpPa&#8722;SO3H COF nanosheets, achieving high gas separation efficiency. Driven by the strong electrostatic interactions, the hydroxyl chains thread through the COF pores, effectively weaving and assembling the composites to achieve exceptional flexibility and high mechanical strength. The penetrated chains also reduce the effective pore size of COFs, and combined with the &#8220;secondary confinement effect&#8221; stemming from abundant CO2 sorption sites in the channels, the PVA@TpPa&#8722;SO3H membrane demonstrates a remarkable H2 permeance of 1267.3 GPU and an H2/CO2 selectivity of 43, surpassing the 2008 Robson upper bound limit. This facile strategy holds promise for the manufacture of large&#8208;area COF&#8208;based membranes for small&#8208;sized gas separations.

         <title>Efficient Water Reforming of Biomass to H2 via Well&#8208;Organized Redox&#8208;Neutral Cleavage of C&#8722;C, O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Using the designed well&#8208;organized redox&#8208;neutral cleavage of C&#8722;C, O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds via photoelectrocatalysis, we develop efficient water reforming of biomass,including glucose, biomass derivatives, and raw biomass, to H2 at room temperature, with a yield up to 93&#8201;%. The clear insights into the kinetic pathway with oxidation of carbon radicals to carbon cations as the indicated rate&#8208;determining step are given by mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) is a clean and environmentally friendly energy carrier. The depletion of fossil fuels makes renewable H2 production highly desirable. Water reforming of renewable biomass to hydrogen, with a relay of natural photosynthesis to biomass, would be an indirect pathway to realize the ideal but extremely challenging photocatalytic overall water splitting to hydrogen, with favorable thermodynamics. Since the seminal work of water reforming of biomass in 1980, great endeavors have been made. Nevertheless, hitherto, the entire kinetic pathway has been elusive, which seriously limits the reforming processes. Using a designed well&#8208;organized redox&#8208;neutral cleavage of C&#8722;C, O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds enabled by photoelectrocatalysis, here, we show the efficient water reforming of biomass to hydrogen at room temperature, with a yield up to 93&#8201;%. The clear insights into the kinetic pathway with oxidation of carbon radicals to carbon cations as the indicated rate&#8208;determining step, would cast brightness for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production to accelerate the hydrogen economy.

         <title>Rational Design of an Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorogenic Platform for In Vivo Orthotopic Tumor Imaging and Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have proposed a general fluorescent platform for designing activatable probes, and the representative probe termed NBS&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE where 4&#8208;hydroxyl mandelic acid has three conjugating sites linked by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophore, a recognition moiety and a quencher. This probe could be well NIR light&#8208;activated and successfully guide the tumor resection, which may be extended to design other activatable probes for biomedical application.







Abstract
Rational and effective design of a universal near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbed platform employed to prepare diverse activatable NIR fluorogenic probes for in&#8197;vivo imaging and the imaging&#8208;guided tumor resection remains less exploited but highly meaningful. Herein, mandelic acid with a core structure of 4&#8208;hydroxylbenzyl alcohol to link recognition unit, a fluorophore and a quencher was employed to prepare activatable probes. We exemplified ester as carboxylesterase (CE)&#8208;recognized unit, ferrocene as quencher and phenothiazinium as NIR fluorophore to afford fluorogenic probes termed NBS&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE and NBS&#8208;C&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE. These probes enabled the conversion toward CE with significant fluorescence increases and successfully discriminate CE activity in cells. NIR light enhances the tumor penetration and enable imaging&#8208;guided orthotopic tumor resection. This specific case demonstrated that this platform can be effectively used to construct diverse NIR probes for imaging analytes in biological systems.

         <title>Amorphous Nanobelts for Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the hard&#8208;soft acids&#8208;bases theory, here we develop a general strategy for preparing 1D amorphous nanomaterials through the modulation of bond strength between metal ions and organic ligands for a moderated fastness. Even crystalline nanomaterials could also be amorphized by reducing the hardness of ions through redox reaction and weak the bond, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical nitrate reduction.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) amorphous nanomaterials combine the advantages of high active site concentration of amorphous structure, high specific surface area and efficient charge transfer of 1D materials, so they present promising opportunities for catalysis. However, how to achievie the balance between the high orientation of 1D morphology and the isotropy of amorphous structure is a significant challenge, which severely obstructs the controllable preparation of 1D amorphous materials. Guided by the hard&#8208;soft acids&#8208;bases theory, here we develop a general strategy for preparing 1D amorphous nanomaterials through the precise modulation of bond strength between metal ions and organic ligands for a moderated fastness. The soft base dodecanethiol (DT) is multifunctionally served as both structure&#8208;regulating agent and morphology&#8208;directing agent. Compared with the borderline acids (e.g. Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+) to construct amorphous structure, soft acid of Cu+ which produced crystalline nanobelts can still be amorphized by reducing the hardness of Cu ions through redox reaction to weak Cu&#8722;SR bond. Due to the combined advantages of amorphous structure and one&#8208;dimensional morphology, amorphous CuDT nanobelts exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical nitrate reduction, outperformed most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This work will effectively bridge the gap between traditional 1D crystalline nanomaterials synthesis and their amorphization preparation.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical Mediated Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger Oxidation over Covalent Triazine/Heptazine&#8208;Based Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine/heptazine&#8208;based frameworks were designed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation. Experimental data and theoretical calculations showed that heptazine/triazine units can decompose in situ produced H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). The in situ generated &#8901;OH on CHF&#8208;TB activates the cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in benzaldehyde and accelerates the formation rate of benzoyl radical intermediates. This approach eliminates the need for active metal catalysts previously reported, offering a mild, metal&#8208;free process with high caprolactone yield and selectivity.







Abstract
The Baeyer&#8211;Villiger (B&#8211;V) oxidation of ketones to the corresponding lactones/esters is a classic and essential reaction in the chemical industry. However, this oxidation process has not yet been achieved in ambient conditions with the aid of oxygen and heterogeneous photocatalysts. In this study, we developed an organic photocatalytic system using covalent triazine/heptazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTF&#8208;TB/CHF&#8208;TB) to enable the B&#8211;V oxidation reaction under mild conditions through a cascade reaction pathway. Experimental data and theoretical calculations showed that heptazine/triazine units can &#8220;chelate&#8221; and decompose the in situ generated H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Compared to conventional methods that primarily involve metal&#8208;activated benzaldehyde at elevated temperatures (e.g., 60&#8201;&#176;C), the &#8901;OH generated in our study can readily cleave the C&#8722;H bond of benzaldehyde, forming an active intermediate that drives subsequent sequential processes: O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Ph&#8208;CO&#8901;&#8594;Ph&#8208;COOO&#8901;. By employing this photocatalytic process, a yield of 91&#8201;% and a selectivity of over 99&#8201;% were obtained in the oxidation of cyclohexanone to caprolactone at room temperature. This performance is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, and our CHF&#8208;TB catalyst demonstrates impressive reusability, maintaining a high yield after 5 consecutive runs. This work presents a straightforward approach for C&#8722;H cleavage by organocatalysts to produce &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone in a mild manner by B&#8211;V oxidation.

         <title>Removal of Residual Additive Enabling Perfect Crystallization of Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron delocalization effect is innovatively utilized to optimize the interaction between additives and PbI2, ensuring the regulation of the crystallization process while effectively avoiding the negative effects caused by additive residual. This strategy further enhanced the device performance, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.95&#8201;%.







Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinges on the precise control of the perovskite film crystallization process, often improved by the inclusion of additives. While dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is traditionally used to manage this process, its removal from the films is problematic. In this work, methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO) was employed instead of DMSO to slow the crystallization rate, as MPSO is more easily removed from the perovskite structure. The electron delocalization associated with the benzene ring in MPSO decreases the electron density around the oxygen atom in the sulfoxide group, thus reducing its interaction with PbI2. This strategy not only sustains the formation of a crystallization&#8208;slowing intermediate phase but also simplifies the elimination of the additive. Consequently, the optimized PSCs achieved a leading power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95&#8201;% along with exceptional stability. This strategy provides a novel method for fine&#8208;tuning perovskite crystallization to enhance the overall performance of photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Highly Dispersed ZnO Sites in a ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst Promote Carbon Dioxide&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines how ZrO2 crystal phases influence CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over ZnO. ZnO on tetragonal zirconia (ZrO2&#8208;t) showed higher activity and selectivity for methanol than on monoclinic zirconia (ZrO2&#8208;m), due to higher ZnO dispersion and an extended ZnO/ZrO2 interface, which enhances HCOO* intermediate conversion into methanol.







Abstract
ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts have shown better activity in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol compared with single component counterparts, but the interaction between ZnO and ZrO2 is still poorly understood. In particular, the effect of the ZrO2 support phase (tetragonal vs. monoclinic) was not systematically explored. Here, we have synthesized ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;t) and monoclinic ZrO2 (ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;m), which resulted in the formation of different ZnOx species, consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer ZnO moieties and large&#8208;sized ZnO particles, respectively. ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;t exhibited a higher methanol selectivity (81 vs. 39&#8201;%) and methanol yield (1.25 vs. 0.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) compared with ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;m. The difference in performance was attributed to the redox state and degree of dispersion of Zn, based on spectroscopy and microscopy results. ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;t had a high density of ZnOx&#8208;ZrOy sites, which favored the formation of active HCOO* species and enhanced the yield and selectivity of methanol along the formate pathway. Such ZnO clusters were further dispersed on ZrO2&#8208;t during catalysis, while larger ZnO particles on ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;m remained stable throughout the reaction. This study shows that the phase of ZrO2 supports can be used to control the dispersion of ZnO and the catalyst surface chemistry, and lead to enhanced catalytic performance.

         <title>Achieving Controllable Thermochromic Fluorescence via Synergistic Intramolecular Charge Transfer and Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing molecular engineering strategies to synergistically control intramolecular charge transfer transitions and packing configurations of fluorophores, we developed thermochromic fluorescent materials with high quantum yield. These materials cover the deep red to near&#8208;infrared region and exhibit a broad peak shift range, showing significant potential for use in programmable multi&#8208;level information encryption devices.







Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) have attracted significant attention due to their unique fluorescent colorimetric response to temperature. However, existing TFMs still suffer from weak stimulus responsiveness, broad temperature response ranges, uncontrollable emission color changes, and low quantum yields. In this study, we address these issues by designing and synthesizing three diketone&#8208;boron complexes with distinct emission wavelengths (NWPU&#8208;(2&#8211;4)). Utilizing a molecular engineering strategy to manipulate intramolecular charge transfer transitions and molecular packing modes, our synthesized complexes exhibit efficient fluorescence emission in both solution and solid states. Moreover, their emission wavelengths are highly sensitive to environmental polarity. By incorporating these compounds into thermosensitive matrices of long&#8208;chain alkanes, we produced TFMs with varied fluorescence emission peak variation ranges. Notably, the TFM based on NWPU&#8208;4, owing to its strong charge transfer transitions and dense J&#8208;aggregate packing configuration, not only exhibits intense fluorescence emission spanning the deep red to near&#8208;infrared spectrum but also displays a remarkable 90&#8197;nm broad range of thermochromic properties. Ultimately, it was successfully applied to programmable, thermally controlled, multi&#8208;level information encryption.

         <title>Integrating Prelithiation and Interface Protection to Achieve High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

The coated Li5FeO4 (LFO) on the surface of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can serve both as a prelithiation agent to compensate for the rapid active Li depletion in the Li&#8208;free anode ASSB, and as a protective layer between NCM811 and Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) to suppress the structural degradation of NCM811 and the decomposition of LPSC.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), particularly those with Li&#8208;free anodes or even anode&#8208;free configurations, have attracted extensive attention due to high safety and energy density. However, chemical&#8208;mechanical degradation typically deteriorates the cycle life and energy of Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs with the absence of Li inventory. Here, the prelithiation agent Li5FeO4 (LFO) coated Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide is developed as the cathode for Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs. The coated LFO acts as an interfacial protective layer to prevent the highly oxidizing Ni&#8208;rich cathode from reacting with sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the structural degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and the decomposition of SSE, resulting in excellent cycle life. Beneficial from the coated LFO in the cathode of the Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs, the reversible capacity improves from 174.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 to 199.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the capacity retention is enhanced from 33.8&#8201;% to 84.8&#8201;% after 100 cycles. Additionally, an ultrahigh energy density of 440&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the mass of the composite cathode, Li&#8208;free anode, and SSE, is obtained in a Li&#8208;free anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell equipped with the LFO&#8208;coated cathode.

         <title>Revealing and Inhibiting the Facet&#8208;related Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first reveal the unknown relation between ion migration and crystal facet, in which the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to occur cationic migration than the (111) facet, and then control the (111)&#8208;orientation through an antisolvent strategy. The PSCs with (111)&#8208;dominated perovskite achieve a PCE of 26.0&#8201;% (25.4&#8201;% certification), and can maintain &gt;95&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 3500&#8208;hours operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination.







Abstract
Ion migration is a major issue hindering the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As an intrinsic characteristic of metal halide perovskite materials, ion migration is closely related to the atomic arrangement and coordination, which are the basic characteristic differences among various facets. Herein, we report the facet&#8208;related ion migration, and then achieve the inhibition of ion migration in perovskite through finely modulating the facet orientation. We show that the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to cationic migration than the (111) facet. The main reason for this difference in migration is that the cationic migration route in the (111) facet deviates from that in the (100) facet, which increases the active migration energy and weakens the contribution from the electric field during operation. We prepare a (111)&#8208;dominated perovskite film by incorporating a facile and green addition of water (H2O) into the antisolvent, further achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.0&#8201;% (25.4&#8201;% certification) on regular planar PSCs and 25.8&#8201;% on inverted PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3500&#8208;hours operation under simulated AM1.5 illumination at the maximum power point.

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on AuCu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Aerogels under Wide Potential Window</title>

AuCu single&#8208;atom alloy aerogels (AuCu SAAs) electrocatalyst toward NO3RR with high faradaic efficiency and active ammonia yield under a wide potential window.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is very attractive for nitrate removal and ammonia production in industrial processes. However, the nitrate reduction reaction is characterized by intense hydrogen competition at strong reduction potentials, which greatly limits the Faraday efficiency at strong reduction potentials. Herein, we reported an AuxCu single&#8208;atom alloy aerogels (AuxCu SAAs) with three&#8208;dimensional network structure with significant nitrate reduction performance of Faraday efficiency (FE) higher than 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range (0&#8201;~&#8201;&#8722;1&#8197;V RHE). The FE of the catalyst was close to 100&#8201;% at a high reduction potential of &#8722;0.8&#8197;VRHE, accompanying with NH3 yield reaching 6.21&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;M&#8722;&gt;1&#8201;cm&lt;M&#8722;&gt;2. More importantly, the catalyst maintained a long&#8208;term operation over 400&#8197;h at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;M&#8722;&gt;2 for the NO3RR using a continuous flow system in a H&#8208;cell. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the catalyst can lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation reaction of *NO2, leading to a rapid consumption of the generated *H, facilitate the hydrogenation process of NO3RR, and inhibit the competitive HER at high overpotentials, which efficiently promotes the nitrate reduction reaction, especially in industrial applications.

         <title>Linker&#8208;Mediated Delocalized Excited States in Dimeric Acceptors Enable Efficient Exciton Dissociation with Negligible Energy&#8208;Level Offsets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkage mediates the molecular conformations of dimeric acceptors, influencing molecular assembly and promoting the generation of the delocalized singlet exciton. This strategy enables exciton dissociation at a near&#8208;zero energy offset, achieving 18&#8201;% power conversion efficiency and retaining 85&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after over 1400&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Efficient exciton dissociation at low energy offsets is key to overcoming voltage losses in organic solar cells. In this work, we developed two dimeric acceptors, i&#8208;YT and o&#8208;YT, by precisely controlling the position of an asymmetric electron&#8208;donating linker. It induced the foldamer conformation of i&#8208;YT with a para linkage (relative to the dicyano groups), while retaining the unfold conformation for o&#8208;YT. This subtle structural modification influenced the molecular assembly properties, enabled near&#8208;zero energy offset exciton dissociation and power conversion efficiencies exceeding 18&#8201;% for i&#8208;YT based organic solar cells. Detailed excitonic dynamics further revealed that the linker position critically influences three processes: the formation of delocalized singlet excited states, ultrafast charge transfer (~5&#8197;ps) in solid blends, and the suppression of exciton recombination. Additionally, devices based on i&#8208;YT demonstrated outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 85&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,400&#8197;hours of continuous illumination. These findings introduce a new class of dimeric acceptors that combine high efficiency with exceptional stability, offering a promising pathway toward low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Asymmetric Modification of Carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Hybrid Strategy for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

An asymmetric 9H&#8208;thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole (TTID) core based on the hybrid strategy is constructed. With the hybrid thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene unit, the synthesized K1 and KF SAMs show favorable surface wettability, downshifted HOMO energy level, and good defect passivation capability. The fluorine substituent donates high dipole moment for the KF molecule and enhanced device stability. Solar cell with KF exhibits a certified PCE of 25.17&#8201;% and exceptional operational stability.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) are widely applied in inverted perovskite solar cells (iPSCs) due to their unique molecular properties. However, the symmetrical structure of the carbazole&#8208;based SAMs makes it difficult to finely regulate their performance, which impedes the further enhancement of the efficiency and stability of iPSCs. This work demonstrates that by constructing an asymmetric carbazole core, 9H&#8208;thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole) (TTID), the key properties of SAM molecules can be effectively regulated. It has been confirmed that the hybrid thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene unit of this asymmetric core governs the energy level, the surface wettability, and the defect passivation capability of the SAMs, while the substituent of core has a greater impact on the molecular dipole and device stability. The synergistic effects from thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene and fluorine lead to the KF&#8208;derived iPSC demonstrating a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.17&#8201;% and excellent operational stability. This hybrid design concept offers a promising approach for the further structural modification of SAMs in iPSCs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Barium Promoter Enormously Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor during the ammonia decomposition. The optimized Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 realizes the highest activity among all non&#8208;noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.







Abstract
As a well&#8208;established topic, single&#8208;atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single&#8208;atom form, the intrinsic roles of single&#8208;atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition. The optimized Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst achieves extremely high H2 production rate of 138.3 mmolH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 at very low temperature (500&#8201;&#176;C, GHSV=840,000&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Co&#8722;Ba/Y2O3 exhibits excellent durability during the 350&#8197;h test, which realizes the highest activity among all non&#8208;noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Both Y2O3 and Co demonstrate positive interactions with Ba, which significantly facilitates the dispersion of Ba species at high temperatures (&#8805;600&#8201;&#176;C). Ba single atoms significantly enhance the charge density of Co and form additionally active Co&#8722;O&#8722;Ba&#8722;Y2O3 interfacial sites, which alleviates hydrogen poisoning and decreases the reaction barrier of the N&#8722;H bond activation of *NH. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.

         <title>Chiral Polar Bifunctional Polyimide Enantiomers for Asymmetric Photo&#8208; and Piezo&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polar polyimide (PI) enantiomers are developed as novel bifunctional nano&#8208;catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The chiral PI catalysts exhibit the chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic H2O2 production, with tunable selectivity between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light in different bands, and also present remarkable chiral piezocatalytic preference, which achieves asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and chiral tyrosines conversion into dihydroxyphenylalanine and dityrosine under ultrasonic vibration.







Abstract
Chiral catalysts for asymmetric catalysis represent a crucial research focus in chemistry and materials science. However, a few cases about chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalysts primarily focus on plasmonic noble metals. Particularly, developing chiral nano&#8208;catalysts that can be driven by mechanical energy remains in the blank stage. Herein, organic polymer&#8208;based enantiomers, chiral polar polyimide (PI) microspheric nano&#8208;assembly are synthesized as novel bifunctional catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The PI catalyst enantiomers present enantioselectivity towards left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, demonstrating chiral&#8208;dependent H2O2 photoproduction. Interestingly, enantioselectivity of the catalyst reverses under irradiation of different bands, presenting tunability in the interaction between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light. For the first time, enantioselective piezocatalytic behavior is demonstrated by the chiral polar PI catalysts. They show remarkable chiral preference for asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and enantioselective conversion of tyrosine substrates under ultrasonic vibration. The findings provide a new perspective into exploring metal&#8208;free chiral catalysts and their asymmetric catalysis applications across multiple energy forms.

         <title>Zincophilic Sites Enriched Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework as Multifunctional Regulating Interfacial Layers for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with zincophilic sites as a multifunctional layer to regulate Zn anodes with controlled spatial ion flux and stable interfacial chemistry is fabricated. This artificial layer helps address the issues of dendritic growth and side reactions on Zn electrodes simultaneously and achieve stable zinc metal batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
To construct an efficient regulating layer for Zn anodes that can simultaneously address the issues of dendritic growth and side reactions is highly demanded for stable zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, we fabricate a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with zincophilic sites as a multifunctional layer to regulate Zn anodes with controlled spatial ion flux and stable interfacial chemistry (MA&#8208;BTA@Zn). The framework with abundant H&#8208;bonds helps capture H2O and remove the solvated shells on [Zn(H2O)6]2+, leading to suppressed side reactions. The HOF layer also helps form electrolyte&#8208;philic surfaces and expose Zn (002) crystal planes which benefit for rapid conduction and uniform deposition of Zn2+, and weakened sides reactions. Additionally, the electrochemically active zincophilic sites (C=O, &#8722;NH2 and triazine groups) favor the targeted guidance and penetration of Zn2+ and provide advantageous sites for uniform Zn deposition. High Young's modulus of the HOF layer further contributes to a high interfacial flexibility and stability against Zn plating&#8208;associated stress. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn symmetric cells thereby obtain a substantially extended battery life over 1000&#8197;h at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn||Cu half&#8208;cell demonstrates a highly reversible Zn stripping/plating process over 1500&#8197;cycles with impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Inhomogeneous Coordination in High&#8208;Entropy O3&#8208;Type Cathodes Enables Suppressed Slab Gliding and Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

In this work, we report a novel layered cathode material (NaNi0.29Cu0.1Mg0.05Li0.05Mn0.2Ti0.2Sn0.11O2) based on the &#8242;high&#8208;entropy&#8242; design. We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metals (TM), can enable enhanced gliding energy (&#8722;0.38 vs &#8722;0.58&#8197;eV) of TMO2 slabs upon (de)sodiation, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials. Thus, it displays a O&#8208;type to P&#8208;type phase transition with superior structure stability and superior electrochemical performance in half cell, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cell and pouch cell.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered oxides are highly promising cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), however they undergo complex phase transitions and exhibit high sensibility to air, leading to subpar cycling performance and commercial viability. In this work, we report a layered cathode material (NaNi0.29Cu0.1Mg0.05Li0.05Mn0.2Ti0.2Sn0.11O2) with a sate&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;entropy compositional design. We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metal (TM) elements, can enable enhanced gliding energy (&#8722;0.38 vs &#8722;0.58&#8197;eV) of TMO2 slabs upon desodiation both theoretically and experimentally, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials. As a consequence, the complex phase transitions (O3&#8722;O&#8242;3&#8722;P3&#8722;P&#8242;3&#8722;P3&#8242;&#8722;O3&#8242;) of conventional O3&#8208;type cathode have been eliminated, and the as&#8208;obtained material demonstrates exceptional structural robustness and integrity with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life in a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cell (maintaining 73.2&#8201;% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2&#8197;C). Moreover, the material presents satisfactory air stability, with minimal structural and electrochemical degradation when directly exposed to the air. An Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell based on the cathode material is constructed, demonstrating a capacity retention of 83.6&#8201;% after 500 cycles, signaling substantial promise for commercial applications.

         <title>Fe&#8722;N Co&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photoanode with Record Photocurrent for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N co&#8208;doped BiVO4 exhibited a high charge separation efficiency and rapid water oxidation kinetics due to the formation of shallow trapping states by N&#8208;coordinated Fe, and further loading FeNiOOH cocatalyst, a recorded photocurrent of 7.01&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be reached, which is very close to the BVO's theoretical value of 7.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Bismuth vanadate (BVO) ranks among the most promising photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Nonetheless, slow charge separation and transport, besides the sluggish water oxidation kinetics, are key barriers to its photoefficiency. Here, we present a co&#8208;doping strategy that significantly improves the charge separation performance of BVO photoanodes. We found that, under standard one sun illumination, the Fe&#8722;N co&#8208;doped BVO photoanode (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;BVO) by N&#8208;coordinated Fe precursor reaches a record photocurrent density of 7.01&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs RHE after modified a surface co&#8208;catalyst (FeNiOOH), and exhibits an outstanding stability. By contrast, much lower photocurrent density is obtained for the N&#8208;doped, Fe&#8208;doped and Fe/N&#8208;doped BVO photoanode with separated N and Fe precursors. The detailed experimental characterizations show that the high activity of the Fe&#8722;N co&#8208;doped BVO photoanode is attributed to the enhanced photo&#8208;induced bulk charge separation, as well as the accelerated surface water oxidation kinetics. XPS, EXAFS and DFT calculations clearly show that, instead of formation of deep trapping state in the individually doped BVO, the co&#8208;doping of Fe&#8722;N into BVO generates Fe&#8208;based electronic states just below the bottom of conduction band and N&#8208;derived states just above the top of valence band. Such modulations in electronic structure enable the efficient trap of the electrons and holes to enhance the separation of photo&#8208;induced carriers, but hinder the charge recombination originated from the deep trapping sites.

         <title>Unprecedented Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Covalent Triazine Frameworks Constructed from Fused Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two near&#8208;perfect coplanar covalent triazine frameworks using triazine rings as linkers and incorporating thiophene&#8208;containing fused ring compounds as building blocks. These fused CTFs demonstrate superior electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency compared to non&#8208;fused counterparts, leading to an extraordinary H2O2 production rate to 74956&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 10&#8201;% BA as a sacrificial agent, surpassing existing organic photocatalysts by nearly an order of magnitude.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered attention for their potential in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, their photocatalytic efficiency is impeded by insufficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. Constructing COFs with superior planarity is an effective way to enhance the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and facilitate electron&#8208;hole separation. Nonetheless, the conventional linear linkers of COFs inevitably introduce torsional strain that disrupts coplanarity. Herein, we address this issue by introducing inherently coplanar triazine rings as linkers and fused building blocks as monomers to create covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with superior coplanarity. Both experimental and theoretical calculations confirm that CTFs constructed from fused building blocks significantly enhance the electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency and improve the photocatalytic performance, compared to the CTFs constructed with non&#8208;fused building blocks. The frontier molecular orbitals and electrostatic potentials (ESP) revealed that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is preferentially facilitated by the triazine rings, with the water oxidation reaction (WOR) likely occurring at the thiophene&#8208;containing moiety. Remarkably, CTF&#8208;BTT achieved an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 74956&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 when employing 10&#8201;% benzyl alcohol (V/V) as a sacrificial agent in an O2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, surpassing existing photocatalysts by nearly an order of magnitude. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing highly coplanar polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts that enhance the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion process.

         <title>Antimony Component Schottky Nanoheterojunctions as Ultrasound&#8208;Heightened Pyroptosis Initiators for Sonocatalytic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schottky nanoheterojunctions containing Sb component (Sb2Se3@Pt) are designed and constructed via in situ growth of Pt on Sb2Se3 semiconductor with narrow band gaps, which are utilized as US&#8208;heightened pyroptosis initiators to boost SCT&#8208;immunotherapy. The biological effects of Sb2Se3@Pt nanoheterojunction itself combined with sonocatalytic amplification of oxidative stress significantly induce Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;dependent pyroptosis in cancer cells to trigger antitumor immune responses.







Abstract
Pyroptosis, an inflammatory modality of programmed cell death associated with the immune response, can be initiated by bioactive ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, bioactive ion&#8208;induced pyroptosis lacks specificity, and further exploration of other ions that can induce pyroptosis in cancer cells is needed. Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) holds promise due to its exceptional penetration depth; however, the rapid recombination of electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs and the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) impede its broader application. Herein, we discovered that antimony (Sb)&#8208;based nanomaterials induced pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, Schottky heterojunctions containing Sb component (Sb2Se3@Pt) were effectively designed and constructed via in situ growth of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) on Sb2Se3 semiconductor with narrow band gaps, which were utilized as US&#8208;heightened pyroptosis initiators to induce highly effective pyroptosis in cancer cells to boost SCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Under US irradiation, excited electrons were transferred from Sb2Se3 nanorods (NRs) to the co&#8208;catalyst Pt via Schottky junctions, and band bending effectively prevented electron backflow and achieved efficient ROS generation. Moreover, the pores oxidized and depleted the overexpressed GSH in the TME, potentially amplifying ROS generation. The biological effects of the Sb2Se3@Pt nanoheterojunction itself combined with the sonocatalytic amplification of oxidative stress significantly induced Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;dependent pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, SCT treatment with Sb2Se3@Pt not only effectively restrained tumor proliferation but also induced potent immune memory responses and suppressed tumor recurrence. Furthermore, the integration of this innovative strategy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment elicited a systemic immune response, effectively augmenting therapeutic effects and impeding the growth of abscopal tumors. Overall, this study provides further opportunities to explore pyroptosis&#8208;mediated SCT&#8208;immunotherapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis, an inflammatory modality of programmed cell death associated with the immune response, can be initiated by bioactive ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, bioactive ion-induced pyroptosis lacks specificity, and further exploration of other ions that can induce pyroptosis in cancer cells is needed. Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) holds promise due to its exceptional penetration depth; however, the rapid recombination of electron-hole (e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) pairs and the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) impede its broader application.

NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade leading to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles is presented. The nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates are intercepted with unactivated alkynes for the first time. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8722;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization manner.







Abstract
The umpolung of aldimines using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is less explored compared to the established polarity reversal of aldehydes. Described herein is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung /6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade, which leads to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles. For the first time, the nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates have been intercepted with unactivated alkynes. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8722;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner. DFT studies also support the regioselectivity preference for the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, leading to the exclusive formation of the indole products. Moreover, a comparison of Gibbs free energies provides insight into a thermodynamically preferred 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization over a competing oxa&#8208;Michael pathway. Further, this strategy is applied to the formal synthesis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor in a step&#8208;economical method.

         <title>A Tricyclic Framework with Integrated B&#8592;N and Cyano Dual Functionalization for Superior n&#8208;Type Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

A peripheral functionalization strategy is employed on the tricyclic framework anthracene by introducing dual N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 groups to develop two novel acceptors: DBNF and DBNCN, which exhibit an extended &#960;&#8208;backbone, enhanced molecular packing, and improved electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. The DBNF&#8208; and DBNCN&#8208;based copolymers, exhibit remarkable electron mobility of 3.04&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and maximum power factor of 147.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
n&#8208;Type conjugated polymers featuring low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, the synthesis of acceptors with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics presents a significant challenge. Herein, a peripheral functionalization strategy is employed on the tricyclic framework anthracene by introducing dual N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 groups to enhance its electron&#8208;withdrawing capability. This approach successfully navigates synthetic challenges, leading to the development of two novel acceptor building blocks: DBNF and DBNCN. Compared to the counterparts with a single N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 moiety, DBNF and DBNCN exhibit an extended &#960;&#8208;backbone, enhanced molecular packing, and improved electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Utilizing these innovative acceptor monomers, copolymers, PDBNF and PDBNCN, are synthesized, which exhibit considerably suppressed LUMO &#8776;&#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. The deep LUMO of PDBNF together with its favourable bimodal packing orientation leads to remarkable electron mobility of 3.04&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with improved stability in OTFTs. Importantly, efficient n&#8208;doping in OTEs is achieved with PDBNCN, exhibiting exceptional conductivity of 95.5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor of 147.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2&#8212;among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers. This work underscores the effectiveness of introducing dual B&#8592;N and cyano functionalities in attaining high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type plastic electronics.

         <title>Mn&#8722;Ce Symbiosis: Nanozymes with Multiple Active Sites Facilitate Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Based on Electron Transfer and Confinement Anchoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanozyme inspired by the mutual exchange of nutrients between nitrogen&#8208;fixing bacteria and leguminous plants as well as the confinement of rhizobia colonization within root cells was constructed by confinement anchoring of rhizobium&#8208;like CeOx nanoclusters on root&#8208;like Mn3O4 nanosupports, leading to lattice interlacing and electron transfer from Mn2+ to Ce4. CeOx/Mn3O4 showed enhanced ROS scavenging in chemical simulations and cellular environments.







Abstract
Regulating appropriate valence states of metal active centers, such as Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+, as well as surface vacancy defects, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of cerium&#8208;based and manganese&#8208;based nanozymes. Drawing inspiration from the efficient substance exchange in rhizobia&#8208;colonized root cells of legumes, we developed a symbiosis nanozyme system with rhizobia&#8208;like CeOx nanoclusters robustly anchored onto root&#8208;like Mn3O4 nanosupports (CeOx/Mn3O4). The process of &#8220;substance exchange&#8221; between Ce and Mn atoms&#8212;reminiscent of electron transfer&#8212;not only fine&#8208;tunes the metal active sites to achieve optimal Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios but also enhances the vacancy ratio through interface defect engineering. Additionally, the confinement anchoring of CeOx on Mn3O4 ensures efficient electron transfer in catalytic reactions. The final CeOx/Mn3O4 nanozyme demonstrates potent catalase&#8208;like (CAT&#8208;like) and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like (SOD&#8208;like) activities, excelling in both chemical settings and cellular environments with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This research not only unveils a novel material adept at effectively eliminating ROS but also presents an innovative approach for amplifying the efficacy of nanozymes.

The final CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme demonstrates potent catalase-like (CAT-like) and superoxide dismutase-like (SOD-like) activities, excelling in both chemical settings and cellular environments with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This research not only unveils a novel material adept at effectively eliminating ROS but also presents an innovative approach for amplifying the efficacy of nanozymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes with Emission up to 1010&#8197;nm: Synthesis, Structures, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of perylene&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (1&#8211;4) have been synthesized and characterized. This design extends the absorption and emission wavelengths of these helical materials into the near&#8208;infrared region, with emission maxima reaching up to 1010&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the helical NGs also show high fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized absorbing or emitting materials offer distinct advantages over their visible&#8208;light counterparts and have attracted considerable interest across various fields. Materials exhibiting NIR chiroptical properties with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are particularly rare. In this study, we report the synthesis of a series of helical nanographenes (1, 2, 3, and 4), where perylene is fused with one to four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (sub) units by a strategy involving Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition followed by a Scholl reaction. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed their structures, revealing helicene moieties integrated into a highly contorted framework. Benefiting from a similar distribution pattern of frontier molecular orbitals to perylene and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, compounds&#8197;1&#8211;4 demonstrate respectable &#934;F values of 31.9&#8201;%, 15.0&#8201;%, 13.7&#8201;%, and 6.5&#8201;%, respectively, with emission maxima reaching up to 1010&#8197;nm. Their enantiopure forms, isolated by preparative chiral HPLC, exhibit distinct circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence across a broad spectral range, extending from the ultraviolet to the NIR.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Precise Structure and Extremely Exposed Active Site for Efficient H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniform dispersion of single Ni center with well&#8208;defined structure was facilely achieved by anchoring nanosized NiPOM on graphene oxide (GO). The resulting NiPOM/GO was used to couple with CdS photoabsorber to achieve ultra&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution performance of 2753.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gPOM&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing a record value among all the POM&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts with precise structure and extremely high catalytic efficiency remain a fervent focus in the fields of materials chemistry and catalytic science. Herein, a nickel&#8208;substituted polyoxometalate (POM) {NiSb6O4(H2O)3[&#946;&#8208;Ni(hmta)SbW8O31]3}15&#8722; (NiPOM) with one extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3] was synthesized using the conventional aqueous method. The uniform dispersion of single nickel center with well&#8208;defined structure was facilely achieved by anchoring nanosized NiPOM on graphene oxide (GO). The resulting NiPOM/GO can couple with CdS photoabsorber for the construction of low&#8208;cost and ultra&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution system. The H2 yield can reach to 2753.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gPOM&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents a record value among all the POM&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Remarkablely, an extremely high hydrogen yield of 3647.28&#8197;mmol&#8201;gPOM&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved with simultaneous photooxidation of commercial waste plastic, representing the first POM&#8208;based photocatalytic system for H2 evolution and waste plastic conversion. This work highlights a straightforward strategy for constructing extremely exposed single&#8208;metal site with precise microenvironment by facilely manipulating nanosized molecular cluster to control individual atom.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered O&#8208;Heterocycles through Cross&#8208;[4+4] Cycloaddition of Quinone Methides</title>

         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloaddition reactions of vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) with either ortho&#8208; or para&#8208;quinone methides yielded inherently chiral eight&#8208;membered O&#8208;heterocycles in high yields with high to excellent stereoselectivity. These products display a unique combination of inherent, axial, and central chirality.







Abstract
Inherently chiral eight&#8208;membered rings embedded in tetraphenylene derivatives and hetero&#8208;analogues exhibit unique properties and allow diverse applications. A conceptually viable and straightforward approach to these frameworks is [4+4] cycloaddition, which still remains elusive. Herein, we describe the stereoselective cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloaddition of quinone methides (QMs), leading to the formation of oxa&#8208;analogues of tetraphenylene with exceptional chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The structures of these novel rigid eight&#8208;membered O&#8208;heterocycles were explored by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their stereochemical stability was elaborated through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermal racemization experiments. The developed methodology exhibited broad substrate scope and the resulting cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadducts could be readily transformed into valuable chiral building blocks. Our findings expand the library of inherently chiral medium&#8208;sized rings and also contribute to the advancement of asymmetric cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadditions of quinone methides.

         <title>Constructing Ag/Cu2O Interface for Efficient Neutral CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of Ag/Cu2O interface significantly enhanced the C2H4 partial current density from 250.9 (Cu2O) to 429.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the neutral electrocatalytic CO2RR, showing a great breakthrough in activity and selectivity toward single products. Analytical results reveal partially preserved Cu+ species and increased CO coverage at interface synergistically promote C&#8722;C coupling, which enhances the understanding of bimetallic interface functions.







Abstract
Neutral CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbons (C2+) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO2 and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Here, we reported an optimized Ag&#8208;Cu2O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6&#8201;% at 650&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FEC2H4 of 66.0&#8201;% with a partial current density of 429.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, making it stand out among the reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu2O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu+/Cu0 active sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated the enhanced CO formation and C&#8722;C coupling at the Ag/Cu2O interface. This work reported an unprecedented neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 performance and provided an in&#8208;depth comprehension of the role of the bimetallic interface.

&lt;p&gt;Construction of Ag/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O interface significantly enhanced the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; partial current density from 250.9 (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to 429.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the neutral electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, showing a great breakthrough in activity and selectivity toward single products. Analytical results reveal partially preserved Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species and increased CO coverage at interface synergistically promote C&#8722;C coupling, which enhances the understanding of bimetallic interface functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutral CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to multi-carbons (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial-relevant current densities (&amp;gt;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Here, we reported an optimized Ag-Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6&#8201;% at 650&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FE&lt;sub&gt;C2H4&lt;/sub&gt; of 66.0&#8201;% with a partial current density of 429.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, making it stand out among the reported Cu-based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; active sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated the enhanced CO formation and C&#8722;C coupling at the Ag/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O interface. This work reported an unprecedented neutral CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; performance and provided an in-depth comprehension of the role of the bimetallic interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cognitive diversity explores aspects beyond traditional lenses of culture, physical diversity, and merit and into variations in problem solving skills. Understanding aspects that need to be recognized in recruitment for various scientific enterprises will promote higher productivity, efficiency, diversity and heterogeneity in a team.







Abstract
Cognitively diverse teams outperform high intelligence (IQ) teams in problem solving, while businesses with at least one woman in their board of directors financially outperform ones with all men boards. These well&#8208;known facts are lost in most academic science enterprises. Herein, we make the case for looking at sources, approaches, and opportunities in expanding cognitive diversity of research teams for high productivity and efficiency.

         <title>Earth: An Oxidative Planet with Limited Atom Resources and Rich Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The depletion of natural resources and the extensive use of oxidative processes by humans violate a number of Earth's planetary boundaries, threatening our very existence. Chemistry is largely responsible for this situation, but it is also central to the solutions. Transitioning to a more &#8220;reductive&#8221; approach&#8212;especially using green hydrogen and sustainable chemistry within the framework of a circular economy&#8212;is one of the key solutions.







Abstract
Humanity faces an unprecedented survival challenge: climate change, driven by the depletion of natural resources, excessive waste generation, and deforestation. Six out of nine planetary boundaries have been exceeded, signaling that Earth is far from a safe operating space for humanity. In this Viewpoint Article we explore three critical &#8220;atomic&#8208;molecular&#8221; challenges: Earth's limited atomic resources, its oxidative nature, and very rich chemistry. Addressing these requires a transformation in how we produce and consume, emphasizing sustainable practices aligned with the United Nations&#8217; 17&#8197;goals. The advancement of science and technology has extended human life expectancy and improved quality of life. However, to ensure a sustainable future, we must move towards less oxidative chemical processes, incorporate CH4&#8722;CO2 redox chemistry into the circular economy, and transition from a linear, fossil fuel&#8208;dependent economy to a circular bioeconomy. Reforestation and the recovery of degraded lands are essential, alongside the shift towards green and sustainable chemistry. Earth's dynamic chemistry is governed by the principles of thermodynamics and kinetics, but science alone is insufficient. Achieving global sustainability requires coordinated economic, political, and social decisions that recognize Earth's limited resources and oxidative nature. Together, these efforts will position humanity to meet the challenges of climate change and secure a sustainable future.

Building functional fluorophores from a simple scaffold. In their Research Article (e202415627), Lei Zhang, Su Jing, Thorben Cordes, and co&#8208;workers use the Ugi&#8208;4&#8208;component reaction to assemble fluorogenic dye molecules that selectively localize to mitochondria or lysosomes. The multifunctional fluorophores are not only fluorogenic but also induce pyroptosis in living cancer cells. The study shows the potential of scaffold&#8208;based synthesis for creation of new functional fluorophores.

The discovery of four&#8208;state electrochromism in a covalent organic framework (COF) is presented by Kuo&#8208;Chuan Ho and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202416046). The picture visualizes the COF's hexagonal lattice, constructed from tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) and terephthalaldehyde (PDA). The colorful butterflies&#8212;orange, pear, green, and cyan&#8212;serve as metaphors for the four distinct electrochromic states arising from the redox activity within the TAPA&#8208;PDA&#8208;based COF.

         <title>Giant Polyketide Synthases Biosynthesize a Marine Polyether Biotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fallon, Shende, Moore, and co&#8208;workers have identified for the first time genes encoding giant type I polyketide synthases (PKZILLA&#8208;1 &amp; 2) in the &#8220;golden alga&#8221; Prymnesium parvum for the biosynthesis of the polyether toxin prymnesin&#8208;1, corroborating long&#8208;held biosynthetic postulates. The authors&#8217; approach may serve as a blueprint for the future discovery of the biosynthetic machineries underlying other polyether toxins.







Abstract
Prymnesin toxins were probably the direct cause of the environmental catastrophe in the Oder river in 2022. They belong to the so&#8208;called ladder polyethers, which are among the most toxic non&#8208;proteinogenic substances and have caused a whole series of food poisoning in humans and numerous other incidents of fish deaths. Despite massive efforts, the enzymatic machinery has remained enigmatic. In a recent study, researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California, San Diego, have uncovered the initial mechanisms by which algae produce these toxins. Crucial to the breakthrough was the methodological advance in sequencing and assembly that allowed the identification and analysis of the largest polyketide synthase (PKS) known to date, named PKZILLA&#8208;1 and PKZILLA&#8208;2, which enabled, among other things, the confirmation and elucidation of stereocenters. Thus, further investigations into the biosynthesis and other aspects of these highly toxic substances are made possible, which could perhaps make these &#8242;biblical plagues&#8242; predictable.

         <title>Confinement Effects and Manipulation Strategies of Nanocomposite Membranes towards Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomposite membranes with nanoscale channels are vital for molecular separation. This review categorizes these membranes into polymer&#8208;dominated and filler&#8208;dominated types, focusing on confinement effects at the polymer&#8208;filler interface and regulation of membrane channels. We highlight structure&#8208;mass transfer mechanisms, and recent progress in separation applications. Finally, the current challenges and future directions were summarized.







Abstract
Materials featuring well&#8208;defined nanoscale channels offer inherent advantages in the selective transport of gases, liquids, and ions, making them pivotal in applications such as molecular separation, catalysis and energy storage. A crucial challenge lies in assembling ordered nanochannel structures and translating these microscopic architectures into macroscopic regular distributions to enhance performance. Nanocomposites provide a promising solution by incorporating nanoscale material (e.g., filler) that significantly enhances macroscale properties of matrix (e.g., polymer). In this review, we spotlight nanocomposite membranes nanocomposite membranes that utilize confinement effects between filler and matrix to precisely control nanochannel apertures, surface properties, and channel distribution for efficient separation of target systems. We discussed the underlying design principles, channel architectures, and strategies for optimizing polymer&#8208;filler interfaces and nanochannel manipulation within functional membranes. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental mechanisms of mass transport, and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships within the nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation. This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these nanocomposite membranes can be further developed to meet the demands of industrial and environmental applications.

         <title>Aptamer and DNAzyme Based Colorimetric Biosensors for Pathogen Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathogen detection is crucial for preventing and managing health risks. This review consolidates the selection of functional nucleic acids (FNAs) for pathogen detection and the development of cost&#8208;effective, simple diagnostic applications. It focuses on integrating FNAs with gold nanoparticles, polydiacetylenes, protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes in colorimetric biosensors.







Abstract
The detection of pathogens is critical for preventing and controlling health hazards across clinical, environmental, and food safety sectors. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular tools for pathogen detection due to their high specificity and affinity. This review focuses on the in vitro selection of FNAs for pathogens, with emphasis on the selection of aptamers for specific biomarkers and intact pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the selection of DNAzymes for bacterial detection is discussed. The integration of these FNAs into colorimetric biosensors has enabled the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective diagnostic platforms. Both non&#8208;catalytic and catalytic colorimetric biosensors are explored, including those based on gold nanoparticles, polydiacetylenes, protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes. These biosensors offer visible detection through color changes, making them ideal for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future perspectives for advancing FNA&#8208;based colorimetric biosensing technologies for pathogen detection.

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Buried Interface for Efficient SAM&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the analysis of the buried interface instability mechanisms of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) in inverted perovskite solar cells, and highlights representative work to improve their stability. It also proposes potential strategies in material design and processing methods for achieving excellent stability in highly efficient SAM&#8208;based inverted devices.







Abstract
In recent years, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) anchored on metal oxides (MO) have greatly boosted the performance of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by serving as hole&#8208;selective contacts due to their distinct advantages in transparency, hole&#8208;selectivity, passivation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and processing efficiency. While the intrinsic monolayer nature of SAMs provides unique advantages, it also makes them highly sensitive to external pressure, posing a significant challenge for long&#8208;term device stability. At present, the stability issue of SAM&#8208;based PVSCs is gradually attracting attention. In this minireview, we discuss the fundamental stability issues arising from the structural characteristics, operating mechanisms, and roles of SAMs, and highlight representative works on improving their stability. We identify the buried interface stability concerns in three key aspects: 1) SAM/MO interface, 2) SAM inner layer, and 3) SAM/perovskite interface, corresponding to the anchoring group, linker group, and terminal group in the SAMs, respectively. Finally, we have proposed potential strategies for achieving excellent stability in SAM&#8208;based buried interfaces, particularly for large&#8208;scale and flexible applications. We believe this review will deepen understanding of the relationship between SAM structure and their device performance, thereby facilitating the design of novel SAMs and advancing their eventual commercialization in high&#8208;efficiency and stable inverted PVSCs.

         <title>Zipper&#8208;Like Dynamic Switching of Coordination Bonds Gives a Polar Bimetallic Halide Toward Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a zipper&#8208;like dynamic switching of coordination bonds to modulate polarization and physical properties in the bimetallic halide, which opens up a new pathway to design polar molecule&#8208;based materials based on bond&#8208;switching mechanism.







Abstract
Polar molecular crystals hold a promise for controlling bulk physical properties originated in their unique switchable polarity via structural transformation. However, the mechanisms for switching polarization are mainly limited to displacive and disorder&#8208;order phase transitions, which rarely involve the reconstruction of chemical bonds. Here, we have switched and tuned electric polarization in a bimetallic halide, (Neopentylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (1), as verified by light&#8208;excited pyroelectric effect. Most notably, its Ag&#8722;Br coordination bonds show a zipper&#8208;like dynamic switching behavior from the &#8216;locked&#8217; to &#8216;unlocked&#8217; state, namely, reconstruction of chemical bonds. Coupling with the dynamic ordering of organic cations, this bond&#8208;switching transition makes a contribution to switchable polarization of 1. As expected, its polarity creates pyroelectric effect for self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with high sensitivity (3.8&#215;103&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low limit of detection (4.8&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1). This work on the bond&#8208;switching mechanism provides an avenue to design polar molecular candidate for smart optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A General Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Olefins Enabled by Voltage&#8208;Gated Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the discovery and development of a regioselective hydrotrifluoromethylation of olefins under electrochemical conditions. Guided by mechanistic studies, a voltage&#8208;gated electrolysis was designed by integrating two redox processes operating within a narrow potential window. This strategy facilitates olefin hydrotrifluoromethylation (over dibromination) that showcases broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Here we present the first successful hydrotrifluoromethylation of unactivated olefins under electrochemical conditions. Commercially available trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt (TT+&#8722;CF3BF4&#8722;, Ep/2=&#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) undergoes electrochemical reduction to generate CF3 radicals which add to olefins with exclusive chemoselectivity. The resulting carbon centered radical undergoes a second cathodic reduction, instead of a classical HAT process, to generate a carbanion that can be terminated by protonation from solvent. The use of MgBr2 (+0.20&#8197;V onset oxidation potential) plays a key role as an enabling sacrificial reductant for the reaction to operate in an undivided cell. Guided by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies, fine&#8208;tuning the solvent system, trifluoromethylating reagent's counteranion and careful selection of redox processes, this work led to the development of a voltage&#8208;gated electrosynthesis by pairing two redox processes with a narrow potential difference (&#916;E&#8776;1.00&#8197;V) allowing the reaction to proceed with two important advances: (a) high reactivity and selectivity towards hydrotrifluoromethylation over undesired dibromination, and (b) an unprecedented functional group tolerance, including aniline, phenols, unprotected alcohol, epoxide, trialkyl amine, and several redox sensitive heterocycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Chiral 2&#8208;Azetines and Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Allenes Via Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective syntheses of fascinating stable chiral 2&#8208;azetines and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes were achieved through phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines.







Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2&#8208;azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2&#8208;azetines (70&#8211;98&#8201;% yields and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee) through chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines. These 2&#8208;azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et3SiH, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water at rt for 2&#8197;minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones and sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring&#8208;opening reaction through Et3SiH, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90&#8201;% yields and up to 91&#8201;%&#8197;ee).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral 2-azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2-azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2-azetines (70&#8211;98&#8201;% yields and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee) through chiral phosphine-catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne-enones with sulfamate-derived cyclic imines. These 2-azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH, BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and water at rt for 2&#8197;minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one-pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne-enones and sulfamate-derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring-opening reaction through Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH, BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90&#8201;% yields and up to 91&#8201;%&#8197;ee).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A direct catalytic asymmetric conjugate reaction between benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, promoted by a soft Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base cooperative catalysis was developed to access all four stereoisomers of a key intermediate for rocaglaol and its derivatives. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and ligand&#8208;controlled diastereodivergence.







Abstract
Rocaglaol, a representative flavagline, has attracted significant attention because of its unique chemical structure and biological activities. This paper reports a mild and scalable copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. This method allows for the concise synthesis of all possible stereoisomers of a key intermediate of rocaglaol and its derivatives in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective manner using different chiral phosphine ligands. Theoretical insights into the reaction mechanism and the origin of ligand&#8208;dependent diastereodivergence were obtained using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Supramolecular Reconstruction of Self&#8208;Assembling Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust metal&#8208;phenolic coating on the surface of self&#8208;assembled nanospheres has been shown to induce supramolecular reconstruction, enhancing the stability and photogenerated electron transfer during photocatalytic reactions. This synergistic hybrid system significantly boosts both hydrogen production and the sustainability of continuous reactions.







Abstract
Natural photosynthetic systems require spatiotemporal organization to optimize photosensitized reactions and maintain overall efficiency, involving the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of photosynthetic components and their stabilization through synergistic interactions. However, replicating this level of organization is challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently communicating supramolecular nano&#8208;assemblies with nanoparticles or biological architectures, owing to their dynamic instability. Herein, we demonstrate that the supramolecular reconstruction of self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic rhodamine B nanospheres (RN) through treatment with metal&#8208;phenolic coordination complexes results in the formation of a stable hybrid structure. This reconstructed structure enhances electron transfer efficiency, leading to improved photocatalytic performance. Due to the photoluminescence quenching property of RN and its electronic synergy with tannic acid (T) and zirconium (Z), the supramolecular complexes of hybrid nanospheres (RNTxZy) with Pt nanoparticles or a biological workhorse, Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, showed marked improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The supramolecular hybrid particles with a metal&#8208;phenolic coordination layer showed 5.6&#8208; and 4.0&#8208;fold increases, respectively, in the productivities of hydrogen evolution catalyzed by Pt (Pt/RNTxZy) and MR&#8208;1 (M/RNTxZy), respectively. These results highlight the potential for further advancements in the structural and photochemical control of supramolecular nanomaterials for energy harvesting and bio&#8208;hybrid systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Glycerol Oxidation Reaction</title>

Exploring 2D c&#8208;MOFs for Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation Reaction(GOR): This work introduces a novel class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), M2[NiPcS8] with various metal center based on octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8). Focusing on glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), theoretical and experimental analyses reveal the superior performance of the CoS4 site in Co2[NiPcS8] among the family of 2D c&#8208;MOFs M2(M'PcX8) (M/M&#8217;=Cu/Ni/Co, X=S/O/NH). The electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported by carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which contributes to excellent overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27&#8197;V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR.







Abstract
Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. In this study, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27&#8197;V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

         <title>Controlling the Polarity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present study, a series of polar functional group&#8208;grafted MOFs (polarized MOFs) were constructed using a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy, and their pore structures were then used to activate CO2 molecules under ECR conditions. We found that the ECR performance for the polarized MOFs significantly depended on the incorporated polar substituents. This phenomenon simultaneously stemmed from the charge redistribution and mass transfer of CO2 in the micropores of the polarized MOFs.







Abstract
The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs with polar&#160;functional groups to activate&#160;CO2&#160;has not been investigated&#160;in&#160;the context of&#160;CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we&#160;report&#160;a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy&#160;to&#160;incorporate&#160;various functional groups in the MOFs.&#160;We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased&#160;catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental&#160;and theoretical evidence&#160;indicates&#160;that&#160;the presence of&#160;polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution&#160;in the micropores of&#160;MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands&#160;reduces&#160;the energy barrier to generate *COOH,&#160;which&#160;is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2.

     alt="Controlling the Polarity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, a series of polar functional group-grafted MOFs (polarized MOFs) were constructed using a mixed-ligand strategy, and their pore structures were then used to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules under ECR conditions. We found that the ECR performance for the polarized MOFs significantly depended on the incorporated polar substituents. This phenomenon simultaneously stemmed from the charge redistribution and mass transfer of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the micropores of the polarized MOFs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the potential of MOFs with polar&#160;functional groups to activate&#160;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;has not been investigated&#160;in&#160;the context of&#160;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis. In this study, we&#160;report&#160;a mixed-ligand strategy&#160;to&#160;incorporate&#160;various functional groups in the MOFs.&#160;We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased&#160;catalytic performance of electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental&#160;and theoretical evidence&#160;indicates&#160;that&#160;the presence of&#160;polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution&#160;in the micropores of&#160;MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands&#160;reduces&#160;the energy barrier to generate *COOH,&#160;which&#160;is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our&#160;research&#160;offers an effective method of&#160;disrupting&#160;local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under electrochemical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol Based on a Molecule/Nanocarbon Hybrid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stable, homogeneous active sites offered by CoPc molecule own suitable binding strength to the reactant and key intermediates of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway. A hybrid photothermal catalyst, which features carbon nanotube anchored CoPc molecules, realizes a near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity due to the synergistic interaction between intrinsically&#8208;efficient CoPc active sites and CNT photothermal supports for affording an optimal reaction temperature.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion provides an intriguing route for both solar energy storage and CO2 mitigation. For scalable applications, near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity is highly desirable to reduce the energy and cost endowed by low&#8208;value byproducts and complex separation processes, but so far has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate a molecule/nanocarbon hybrid catalyst composed of carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/CNT), which synergistically integrates high photothermal conversion capability for affording an optimal reaction temperature with homogeneous and intrinsically&#8208;efficient active sites, to achieve a catalytic activity of 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of ~99&#8201;% in direct photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Both theoretical calculations and operando characterizations consistently confirm that the unique electronic structure of CoPc and appropriate reaction temperature cooperatively enable a thermodynamic favorable reaction pathway for highly selective methanol production. This work represents an important milestone towards the development of advanced photothermal catalysts for scalable and cost&#8208;effective CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Early Detection of High&#8208;Altitude Hypoxic Brain Injury by In Vivo Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a strategy based on in vivo electrochemistry for early detecting high&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI). The characteristic changes in the brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given that brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the risk of HHBI can be prognosed 3&#8197;days in advance according to the characteristics of brain oxygen change within initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;hours of high&#8208;altitude exposure.







Abstract
High&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI) is a kind of acute mountain sickness and the survival rate of patients with HHBI can be improved only if it is detected and treated at the early stage. However, limited by speediness and accuracy, it is still very difficult for most of current approaches to realize the early detection of HHBI. We propose herein a novel strategy for this goal based on spatiotemporal changes in the brain oxygen level. As revealed by in vivo electrochemistry, the characteristic changes of brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure are directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the degree of HHBI can be diagnosed by the variation of brain oxygen, making the early detection of HHBI feasible. In addition, the risk of HHBI for mouse exposed to high&#8208;altitude hypoxia environments can be also prognosed days in advance.

         <title>A Discrete Four&#8208;Stranded &#946;&#8208;Sheet through Catenation of M2L2 Metal&#8211;Peptide Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discrete four&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheet was precisely constructed by metal&#8208;induced folding and assembly of a short peptide. This was achieved by folding and assembly of Ag+ and the Ala&#8208;D3pa&#8208;Gly&#8208;3pa&#8208;Val (3pa: &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;alanine) pentapeptide, which was designed to form an interlocking Ag2(1)2 ring through metal cross&#8208;linking of the side chains. The structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and various NMR measurements.







Abstract
Methods for precisely constructing a &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly with number&#8208;defined strands in solution remains quite limited due to its intense aggregation property. Here, we report the precise construction of a four&#8208;stranded anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet by utilizing a non&#8208;covalent approach. This was achieved by folding and assembly of Ag+ and a pentapeptide (1) with the Ala&#8208;D3pa&#8208;Gly&#8208;3pa&#8208;Val (3pa: &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;alanine) sequence, which was designed to form an interlocking Ag2(1)2 ring through metal cross&#8208;linking of the side chains. NMR analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies characterized the structure of the discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly as well as the remarkable structural selectivity in terms of strands&#8217; number, orientation and the sheet type.

         <title>Biocatalytic Desymmetrization for the Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls Using an Engineered Imine Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine reductases were identified and engineered to construct axially chiral biaryl amines via desymmetrization. The methodology was applied to 24 structurally diverse substrates with high efficiency and atroposelectivity. Molecular dynamics simulation on the variants reveals the mechanisms for increased activity and atroposelectivity. This strategy enriches the toolbox for the biocatalytic synthesis of atropisomers.







Abstract
The enzymatic atroposelective synthesis of biaryl compounds is relatively rare, despite considerable attention received by biocatalysis in the academic and industrial sectors. Imine reductases (IREDs) are an important class of enzymes that have been applied in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amine building blocks. In this study, two IREDs (IR140 and IR189) were identified to catalyze the efficient desymmetrization of biaryls utilizing various amine donors. Further protein engineering enabled the identification of variants (IR189&#8197;M8&#8211;M9 and IR189&#8197;M13&#8211;M14) that are able to catalyze the formation of both (R) and (S) atropisomers in excellent yields and atroposelectivities (24 examples, up to 99&#8201;% ee and yield). The absolute configuration and rotational barriers were confirmed, and the reactions were readily scaled up to allow isolation of the atropisomeric product in 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield. The optically pure biaryl amines were further derivatized into various synthetically useful atropisomers. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed, offering plausible explanations for the improved atroposelectivity and enzymatic activity. The current strategy expands the scope of the IRED&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral biaryl amines, contributing significantly to the field of atroposelective biocatalysis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Lactamization and Iminolactonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization and iminolactonization reactions of aliphatic amides is reported, featuring the use of practical and inexpensive catalyst, oxidant, and protecting groups. The dual reaction pathways are switchable by altering reaction conditions. This protocol enables the synthesis of structurally diverse spiro&#8208;, fused&#8208;, or bridged&#8208;lactams and iminolactones from readily available carboxylic acids.







Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop &#947;&#8208;lactamization reactions for pyrrolidinone synthesis using either cyclometallation, C&#8722;H insertion, or radical C&#8722;H abstraction strategies, &#947;&#8208;lactamization reactions of aliphatic amides using practical catalysts and common protecting groups remain extremely rare. Herein we report copper&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization and iminolactonization of tosyl&#8208;protected aliphatic amides using inexpensive Selectfluor as the sole oxidant. A switchable selectivity of &#947;&#8208;lactams or &#947;&#8208;iminolactones can be obtained by using two different sets of reaction conditions. Notably, structurally diverse spiro&#8208;, fused&#8208;, and bridged&#8208;lactams and iminolactones, as well as isoindolinones are accessible by this method. Further derivatization of the &#947;&#8208;lactam products enables the synthesis of a range of biologically important motifs, including &#947;&#8208;amino acids, &#948;&#8208;amino alcohols, and pyrrolidines.

         <title>Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reactivity with Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides for the Synthesis of Heteroaryl Sulfondiimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis acid activation promotes the addition of nucleophilic heterocycles to sulfondiimidoyl fluorides to provide a broad range of heteroaryl sulfondiimines. This new SuFEx reactivity capitalizes on mild reaction conditions to achieve high functional group tolerance. The imidic N&#8208;substituents are shown to modulate reactivity at the sulfur&#8208;center.







Abstract
Sulfur functional groups are ubiquitous in molecules used in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and within these collections sulfones hold a prominent position. The double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfones, sulfondiimines, offer significant potential in discovery chemistry but to date their applications have been limited by the lack of convenient synthetic routes. The existing methods mainly rely on imination of low&#8208;valent&#8208;sulfur intermediates, or the combination of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents and electrophilic S(VI)&#8208;functionalities. Herein, we describe a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides with (hetero)aryls. This new SuFEx reactivity benefits from broad functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and does not require the use of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents. The efficient use of unprotected indoles and pyrroles, as well as furan, thiophene and carbocyclic aromatics, further demonstrates the advantages of these reactions. We show that the reactivity of the sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be tuned by switching the N&#8208;substituents, allowing an expansion of the range of coupling partners. The utility of the transformation is exemplified by the synthesis of the sulfondiimine analogue of the HIV&#8208;I reverse transcriptase&#8208;inhibitor L&#8208;737,126.

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Fused Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through Lewis Acid Catalyzed Highly Selective C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange Reaction between Bicyclobutanes and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described is a selective &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines. A chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was also developed to promote an enantioselective version of this reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98&#8201;% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee).

         <title>Harnessing Free Sulfate Groups in Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical nature of sodium sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions was studied. The findings enabled us to develop alternative synthesis routes for sulfated oligosaccharides. Experiments and calculations suggested that the sodium cation acts as a protecting group in glycosylation reactions.







Abstract
General strategies for synthesizing sulfated oligosaccharides employ the protection of sulfate groups for glycosylation or post&#8208;sulfation after the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, the chemical behavior of free sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions has not been thoroughly studied. We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6&#8208;sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2&#8208;NTroc group or 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group using an ortho&#8208;hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;&#8208;glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2&#8208;NHTroc and 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at the 6&#8208;position. Ab initio calculations supported the formation of acyloxonium&#8208;cation via 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation. Additionally, glycosylation reactions under various counter cations of the sulfate group, such as Na+, Li+, K+, Ba2+, and pyridinium were examined. Results showed that sodium and lithium salt donors yielded the products in good yield. These results were also supported by ab initio calculations. Practical glycosylation reactions between disaccharide donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with free sulfate groups successfully yielded the sulfated tetrasaccharides. This study also discusses how a sodium salt acts as a protecting group during glycosylation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal gene cluster consisting of two genes, encoding a class I&#8208;type diterpene cyclase and a cytochrome P450, was identified for the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;vinigrol. As compared to total synthesis routes, the natural pathway for the complete synthesis of this complex and challenging molecule is more concise and efficient, involving three steps, thus highlighting the elegance of the natural synthetic pathways for complex multiring&#8208;system terpenes.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Vinigrol is one of the most complex and challenging molecules in total synthesis; however, the parallel biosynthetic strategy employed by nature for the synthesis of this compound has not yet been identified. In this study, we identified a minimal gene cluster encoding a diterpene cyclase (VniA) and a cytochrome P450 (VniB) which enables the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;vinigrol through three steps. VniA first cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to generate an unusual vinigrol&#8208;type diterpene skeleton, and then VniB catalyzes the allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H iterative oxidation. Further genome mining investigation provides new fungal sources for this rare and valuable vinigrol&#8208;type diterpene skeleton.

         <title>High&#8208;Potential and Stable Organic Cathode for Rechargeable Batteries with Fast&#8208;Charging and Wide&#8208;Temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>

A novel bipolar polymer featuring an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure was well designed by grafting high&#8208;potential p&#8208;type TPA onto high&#8208;capacity n&#8208;type AQ, which effectively addressed the dissolution issue of AQ and improved the average potential. Benefiting from the successful molecular design, the polymer exhibited high stability, excellent fast&#8208;charging capability within 17&#8197;s and superior wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to +80&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Organic carbonyl compounds have been recognized as promising electrodes due to multiple active sites, abundant element resources and flexible structural designability, while their practical applications are still hindered by the easy solubility and low discharge potential. Herein, a novel bipolar polymer composite (TAC) was well&#8208;designed by grafting p&#8208;type triphenylamine units onto n&#8208;type anthraquinone to form an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and in situ growing on carbon nanotubes, which was proved not only with higher discharge potential but also effectively suppress the dissolution issues. Moreover, TAC combined the advantages of different active sites and behaved a dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. Benefitting from the in situ polymerization process, TAC with tube&#8208;type core&#8211;shell structure exhibited enhanced electron transport and improved utilization of active sites, resulting in high capacity (193&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate performance (fast charging within 17&#8197;s), long&#8208;term stability (a high capacity retention of 87&#8201;% after 1000 cycles) and high mass loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, TAC can well adapt to the temperature change, outputting a capacity of 72&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and 165&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Such versatile polymer structure inspires the design of high performance organic materials for rechargeable batteries to satisfy high stability and wide temperature operations.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Synthesis Enabled by Fast and Living Anionic Monoaddition of Vinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;flow living anionic monoaddition of alkyllithium initiators to vinyl monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates has been achieved in a selective manner. This method has been successfully applied to the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multiple vinyl monomers (six&#8208;component addition at maximum).







Abstract
The selective monoaddition of polymerizable vinyl monomers like styrenes and methacrylates in a living manner has been achieved for the flash&#8208;flow preparation of molecules in a defined sequence with high selectivity. We demonstrated the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multifunctional molecules using an initiator, functionalized styrenes, diarylethylenes, various methacrylates, and an electrophilic trapping reagent at the living terminus (six&#8208;component sequential connection at maximum) without any intermediate purification steps. The anionic living terminus of the vinyl monomers in the flow system described herein is active for polymerization, such that the styrene or methacrylate sequence can be expanded to afford highly dispersed oligomers without affecting other single units, which means that the unequivocal sequences were successfully inserted into the internal or terminal positions. The methodology described herein provides an adaptable method for the construction of new molecular spaces based on unimolecular sequence control and pinpoint functionalization.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Configuration Assignment of (+)&#8208;Myxoquaterine&#8208;450</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, modular synthesis of the structurally novel natural product myxoquaterine&#8208;450 (1) has been accomplished. Four building blocks were assembled by cross&#8208;coupling reactions to establish the all&#8208;(E)&#8208;configured hexaene core. The C25,C26&#8208;diastereoisomer of 1 was prepared to clarify the absolute configuration of the yet unassigned stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Myxoquaterines represent a recently discovered class of natural products with intriguing biological properties. They were isolated from Pendulasporacea albinea MSr 11954 and display a unique structure combining heterocyclic (pyrrole, oxazoline), hexaene, and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol subunits. We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine&#8208;450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l&#8208;serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy towards Michael Addition Reactions of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical strategy for organic&#8208;base&#8208;catalyzed Michael addition to cyclopropenes generated in situ is disclosed. In this metal&#8208;free approach, a diverse range of nitrogen nucleophiles, including drugs and bioactive molecules, are well tolerated to provide the triple substituted cyclopropanes, which have been used to access cyclopropane carboxylic acids&#8212;a new class of promising FABP&#8208;4 inhibitors.







Abstract
The development of Michael addition reactions to conjugated cyclopropenes is a challenge in organic synthesis due to the fleeting and reactive nature of such strained Michael acceptor systems. Herein, the development of a photochemical approach towards such conjugated cyclopropenes is reported that serves as a strategic entry point to densely functionalized cyclopropanes in a diastereoselective fashion. The process involves the light&#8208;mediated generation of transient cyclopropenyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters from vinyl diazo esters, followed by an organic base catalyzed nucleophilic addition of N&#8208;heterocycles to directly access &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic cyclopropanoic esters. With this synergistic approach, various trisubstituted cyclopropanes bearing N&#8208;heteroaryl and N&#8208;heterocyclic rings such as indole, pyrrole, benzimidazole, isatin, pyridinone, and quinolinone were accessed efficiently in good yield and decent to good diastereoselectivities. Further, &#946;&#8208;indolyl cyclopropanoic acids have been synthesized and were successfully evaluated as FABP&#8208;4 inhibitors. Theoretical calculations have been performed to elucidate the mechanism, which was further supported by experimental findings.

         <title>Rapid yet Controlled Synthesis of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanocapsules as High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined synthesis of imine&#8208;based 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) could be proceeded at the interface of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsion droplets. Uniform nanocapsules (NCs) could thus be prepared without adding extra catalysts at room temperature in just 4.5 h at a relatively high yields.







Abstract
Synthesis and assembly of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymeric materials present a tricky trade&#8208;off between the high reaction rate and precise morphology control. Here we report a nanoconfined synthesis of imine&#8208;based 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at the interface of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsion droplets stabilized by cationic surfactants. Highly uniform nanocapsules (NCs) could be prepared without adding extra catalysts at room temperature in just 4.5&#8197;h at a yield of 86&#8201;%. The NCs have tunable average diameters of 114&#8211;565&#8197;nm and shell thicknesses of 12&#8211;63&#8197;nm, depending on the monomer and surfactant types/concentrations. Their BET&#8208;specific surface areas are up to 139.0&#8197;m2/g, mainly contributed by narrowly&#8208;distributed mesopores at ~5.0&#8197;nm and micropores at 1.4&#8197;nm at a volume ratio (V1.4/V5.0) of 1.68. The surfactant plays the role of a catalyst during the reaction and interestingly, it also regulates the formation of mesopores and their sizes. Both theoretical and experimental studies confirm that the reaction has been accelerated by two orders of magnitude at the microdroplet interface, compared to that without emulsification. The resulting NCs could be well dispersed in water for at least six weeks with little size&#8208;distribution change, and they have been demonstrated to be highly efficient nanocatalysts in application of water&#8208;based hydrogen evolution, reaching a stable hydrogen production rate at 10.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 6&#8197;hours. Such microdroplet interface&#8208;confined synthesis may facilitate the future development of 2D polymeric materials for more advanced applications.

         <title>C&#8722;H Alkylation of Heterocycles via Light&#8208;Mediated Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoexcitation of palladium catalysts enables the C&#8722;H functionalization of aromatic heterocycles with alkyl halides via a radical strategy. By integrating experimental and computational approaches, we develop a predictive substrate scope and outline generalized synthetic applications.







Abstract
Methods enabling direct C&#8722;H alkylation of heterocycles are of fundamental importance in the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products, bioactive molecules, and medicinally relevant compounds. However, there is a scarcity of a general strategy for the direct C&#8722;H alkylation of a variety of heterocycles using commercially available alkyl surrogates. We report an operationally simple palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H alkylation of heterocycles using alkyl halides under the visible light irradiation with good scalability and functional group tolerance. Our studies suggest that the photoinduced alkylation proceeds through a cascade of events comprising, site&#8208;selective alkyl radical addition, base&#8208;assisted deprotonation, and oxidation. A combination of experiments and computations was employed for the generalization of this strategy, which was successfully translated towards the modification of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Pyrolytic Carbon: An Inexpensive, Robust, and Versatile Electrode for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic organic electrochemistry is a highly useful redox method, enabling diverse transformations. This study explores pyrolytic carbon electrodes in powerful rAP processes and C&#8722;C as well as C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon offers a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional amorphous carbon materials (glassy carbon, GC, or reticulated vitreous carbon, RVC), which are often expensive or unsuitable for large&#8208;scale flow reactions.







Abstract
Synthetic organic electrochemistry is recognized as one of the most sustainable forms of redox chemistry that can enable a wide variety of useful transformations. In this study, readily prepared pyrolytic carbon electrodes are explored in several powerful rAP transformations as well as C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon provides an alternative to classic amorphous carbon&#8208;based materials that are either expensive or ill&#8208;suited to large&#8208;scale flow reactions.

         <title>A Poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) with peri&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Edges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New connecting positions of anthracene have been developed to construct an unprecedented poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) with peri&#8208;fused porphyrin edges via the AA&#8208;type Yamamoto coupling followed by the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Its reactivity towards the full cyclodehydrogenation was investigated by solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted conditions. The peri&#8208;fusion endows a narrow band gap and near&#8208;infrared absorption with the title polymer.







Abstract
Anthracene has served as an important building block of conjugated polymers with the connecting positions playing a crucial role for the electronic structures. Herein, anthracene units have been coupled through their 2,7&#8208;carbons to develop an unprecedented, conjugated polymer, namely, poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) featuring additional peri&#8208;fused porphyrin edges. The synthesis starts from a 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;nickel(II) porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene as the pivotal precursor. Polymerization is achieved by an AA&#8208;type Yamamoto coupling, followed by a polymer&#8208;analogous oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to obtain a peri&#8208;fusion between porphyrin and anthracene moieties. Although further cyclodehydrogenation between the repeating units cannot be achieved in solution, the thermal treatment of the precursor polymer derived from 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene on a metal surface realizes the full cyclodehydrogenation. The difference between solution and on&#8208;surface reactivity can be rationalized by the larger dihedral angle between repeat units in solution, which is reduced under the pronounced interaction with the metal surface. The peri&#8208;fusion in the title polymer gives rise to a narrow electronic band gap optical absorptions extending far into the near&#8208;infrared region. Oligomeric models are synthesized as well to support the analyses of the electronic and photophysical properties.

         <title>Novel Silicate Platform as Weakly&#8208;Coordinating Anions for Diverse Organometallic and Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weakly&#8208;coordinating anions based on Si are reported. These anions support a variety of cations relevant to organometallic and catalytic applications. The methyl&#8208;substituted anion has a wide electrochemical window and supports reversible Mg electrochemistry.







Abstract
Weakly&#8208;coordinating anions (WCAs) are employed in a wide range of applications, but limitations remain, including high reactivity, limited redox window, complicated synthesis, high cost, low solublity, and low structural tunabililty. Herein, we report a new class of WCA based on alkyl or aryl (R) substituted silicates bearing fluorinated pinacolate ligands, &#8220;[RSiF24]&#8722;&#8221;. Anions bearing a variety of R groups were prepared, enabling facile tuning of sterics and solubility.

&lt;p&gt;Weakly-coordinating anions based on Si are reported. These anions support a variety of cations relevant to organometallic and catalytic applications. The methyl-substituted anion has a wide electrochemical window and supports reversible Mg electrochemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakly-coordinating anions (WCAs) are employed in a wide range of applications, but limitations remain, including high reactivity, limited redox window, complicated synthesis, high cost, low solublity, and low structural tunabililty. Herein, we report a new class of WCA based on alkyl or aryl (&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;) substituted &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;si&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;licates bearing &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;luorinated pinacolate ligands, &lt;b&gt;&#8220;[&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Si&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8221;&lt;/b&gt;. Anions bearing a variety of R groups were prepared, enabling facile tuning of sterics and solubility. A range of cations employed in chemical reactivity has been supported by these anions, including ether-free alkali cations, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(COD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. [Pd(dppe)(NCMe)Me]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been generated by salt metathesis or protonation of a metal-alkyl bond, showcasing the ability of the [&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;Si&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Induced by Mercury Ions through Binaphthyl Dopants&#8242; Conjugation Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inversion of the direction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitted by cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) could be achieved by modulating the conjugation degree of the chiral binaphthyl dopant. Hg ion induced CPL sign inversion was achieved by using the thioacetal binaphthyl as a mercury&#8208;responsive chiral dopant in CLCs.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials based on cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms show great promise for applications in information encryption and anticounterfeiting. In this study, we constructed a mercury ion&#8208;responsive CPL system in CLCs by controlling the conjugation degree of axially chiral binaphthyl derivatives. Two chiral binaphthyl derivatives (R/S&#8208;1 and R/S&#8208;2) were initially used as chiral dopants to demonstrate that CPL inversion (glum values from 0.5/&#8208;0.44 to &#8722;0.53/0.48) in CLCs could be achieved by modulating the conjugation degree of the chiral binaphthyls. Based on this concept, the thioacetal binaphthyl R&#8208;2S was developed and used as a mercury&#8208;responsive chiral dopant in CLCs. Under Hg ion treatment, the CPL sign inverted (glum value changed from 0.22 to &#8722;0.29) due to the transformation of the thioacetal into an aldehyde group. Additionally, the mercury ion&#8208;responsive CPL material was applied in information encryption.

         <title>Stabilization of Ethane&#8208;Like Dianionic Diborane(6) in Monometallic Titanium Complexes and its Subsequent B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp3) Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethane&#8208;like classical dianionic diborane(6) species stabilized by mononuclear Cp*Ti have been isolated and structurally characterized. Treatment of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] (M=Mo or W) led to the cleavage of electron&#8208;precise B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp3) bonds that yielded &#312;3&#8208;hydridoborato complexes (see picture).







Abstract
Treatment of [Cp*TiCl3] with [LiBH4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] followed by thermolysis with [Ph2E2] (E=S or Se) resulted in the formation of classical diborane(6) complexes, [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL&#8242;)] (L=C6H4E; L&#8242;=C6H5E; 1&#8201;a: E=S, 1&#8201;b: E=Se), stabilized at titanium template. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first examples of mono&#8208;metallic classical diborane(6) complexes. The bonding analysis and theoretical studies suggest that the stabilization of these diborane(6) species is due to the presence of four bridging ligands in &#312;4&#8208;fashion, where two of them are phenyl thiolates/selenolates that provide more electrons to the electron&#8208;deficient titanium center. Reactions of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] (M=Mo, W) led to the cleavage of the electron&#8208;precise B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp3) bond that yielded &#312;3&#8208;hydridoborato complexes [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;EPh)2{M(CO)4}] (2&#8201;a&#8211;c: R=H, 3&#8201;a&#8211;c: R=Ph). In an attempt to isolate the Te&#8208;analogue of 1&#8201;a&#8211;b, a similar reaction was performed; however, the complex was too unstable to be isolated. Interestingly, the treatment of this unstable intermediate with [W(CO)5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] yielded [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;TePh)2{W(CO)4}] (2&#8201;d: R=H, 3&#8201;d: R=Ph) that are analogues of 2&#8201;a&#8211;c and 3&#8201;a&#8211;c, respectively. Formation of these species provide indirect evidence for the existence of unstable [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL&#8242;)] (L=C6H4Te; L&#8242;=C6H5Te; 1&#8201;c).

         <title>Upconversion/Downshifting Circularly Polarized Luminescence over 1200&#8197;nm in a Single Nanoparticle for Optical Anticounterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, has been realized within a single nanoparticle. This approach enables cutting&#8208;edge encryption applications, including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption.







Abstract
Multimodal upconversion and downshifting circularly polarized luminescent materials hold significant potential for optical anticounterfeiting applications due to their exceptional chiroptical properties. However, constructing these materials within a single emitter remains challenging. In this study, a conceptual model of multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized within a single nanoparticle. A new type of nanoparticles with multilayer core&#8211;shell architecture is fabricated, capable of delivering upconversion/downshifting luminescence, when excited by a 980&#8197;nm laser. Utilizing a co&#8208;assembly strategy, multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL emission, covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, can be realized at the supramolecular level. These chiroptical properties closely follow the chirality of host matrix and are strongly dependent on the distribution mode of nanoparticles within the matrix films. The multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL behavior enabled cutting&#8208;edge encryption applications including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption. This work introduces a novel approach to designing multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL materials and opens new avenues for the development of chiroptical functional materials.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Cucurbalsaminones B and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biosynthesis of cucurbalsaminones, we accomplished the first synthesis of cucurbalsaminones B and C in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to adjust the oxidation state of the sterically hindered C11 position.







Abstract
Cucurbalsaminones B (1) and C (2) are two abeo&#8208;cucurbitane triterpenoids with a unique 5/6/3/6/5&#8208;fused ring system and exhibit potent multidrug resistance (MDR)&#8208;reversing activity. Herein, we report the first synthesis of these two natural products, both of them were accomplished in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to realize the challenging oxidation state adjustment of the sterically hindered C11 position.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Catalysis on Carbon Nanotubes in Electromicrofluidic Reactors: Monoterpene Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies on the cyclization of monoterpenes on carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic devices support that electric&#8208;field catalysis under scalable bulk conditions can stabilize both anionic and cationic transition states, can provide access to reactions general Br&#248;nsted acid, Lewis acid, anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; catalysts do not to really catalyze, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products.







Abstract
The control over the movement of electrons during chemical reactions with oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) has been predicted to offer a general approach to catalysis. Recently, we suggested that many problems to realize electric&#8208;field catalysis in practice under scalable bulk conditions could possibly be solved on multiwalled carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic reactors. Here, we selected monoterpene cyclizations to assess the scope of our system in organic synthesis. We report that electric&#8208;field catalysis can function by stabilizing both anionic and cationic transition states, depending on the orientation of the applied field. Moreover, electric&#8208;field catalysis can promote reactions which are barely accessible by general Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids and field&#8208;free anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products without the need for pyrene interfacers attached to the substrate to prolong binding to the carbon nanotubes. Finally, interfacing with chiral organocatalysts is explored and evidence against contributions from redox chemistry is provided.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Secretome Profiling Enabled by Selective Enrichment and NanoLC&#8208;MS/MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for comprehensive single&#8208;cell secretome profiling (SCSP) by integrating metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins, click chemistry&#8208;based enrichment in an alkyne micro&#8208;reactor, in situ digestion, and nanoLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. SCSP enables an unprecedented depth of the secretome identification, providing a new avenue for studying secretion heterogeneity at the single&#8208;cell level.







Abstract
Recent advances in single&#8208;cell proteomics enable the direct profiling of thousands of proteins from a single mammalian cell. However, due to the bottlenecks in detecting low&#8208;abundance secreted proteins and extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins (collectively referred to as the secretome) against a background of high&#8208;abundance proteins in serum&#8208;containing culture medium, the comprehensive investigation of the secretome at the single&#8208;cell level using nanoLC&#8208;MS/MS still remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel single&#8208;cell secretome profiling (SCSP) method by integrating the metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins, click chemistry&#8208;based enrichment, and in situ digestion of the labeled secretome in an alkyne&#8208;functionalized capillary micro&#8208;reactor, followed by nanoLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. By this method, an average of 389 protein groups were quantified from the secretome of single HeLa cells (n=17), with a total of 752 protein groups confidently identified in the single&#8208;cell secretome, which is a significant increase compared to the previously reported targeted analysis limited to dozens of secreted proteins by antibody recognition. These results indicated that our developed SCSP method would provide a powerful tool to gain insights into secretion heterogeneity and intercellular communication at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Generation of Bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron Enolates from Alkynes and Their Catalyst&#8208;Free Alkyne Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct comprising tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] and 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide reacts with alkynes to generate bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates. The strong Lewis acidity of these boron enolates facilitates the coupling reaction with various unactivated alkynes, resulting in the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in one pot.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions are powerful synthetic tools for constructing organic molecular frameworks. In this study, strongly Lewis acidic bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates were generated from alkynes through oxygen transfer from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide using tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. Boron enolates were highly reactive owing to the strong Lewis acidity of the boron centers, and thus immediately coupled with alkynes. N&#8208;Ethynylphthalimide reacted as an alkyne with 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide and B(C6F5)3 to form a semi&#8208;stable bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolate through the coordination of the carbonyl group to the boron center. This enolate underwent coupling with another alkyne.

         <title>Four&#8208;State Electrochromism in Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208; terephthalaldehyde&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
While several electrochromic COFs (denoted as ecCOFs) have been reported to date, a closer survey suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three&#8208;state electrochromism [Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606&#8211;1261]. Herein, we report four&#8208;state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism in tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208;terephthalaldehyde&#8208;based COF constructed through the metal&#8208;catalyst free Schiff base approach.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of massive interest due to their potential application spanning diverse fields such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, drug delivery systems, sensing, and organic electronics. In view of their application&#8208;oriented quest, the field of electrochromism marked a significant stride with the reporting of the first electrochromic COF in 2019 [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 19831&#8211;19838]. Since then, new and novel COF structures with electrochromic features (denoted as ecCOFs) have been searched continuously. Yet, only a handful of ecCOFs have been constructed to date. A closer look at these reports suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three&#8208;state electrochromism [Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606&#8211;1261]. Herein, we report four&#8208;state electrochromism in tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208;terephthalaldehyde (TAPA&#8208;PDA)&#8208;based COF constructed through the metal&#8208;catalyst free Schiff base approach. The four&#8208;state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism demonstrated by the TAPA&#8208;PDA ecCOF opens several futuristic avenues for ecCOF&#8242;s end use in flip&#8208;flop logic gates, intelligent windows, decorative displays, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

&lt;p&gt;While several electrochromic COFs (denoted as &lt;sup&gt;ec&lt;/sup&gt;COFs) have been reported to date, a closer survey suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three-state electrochromism [&lt;i&gt;Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606&#8211;1261&lt;/i&gt;]. Herein, we report four-state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism in tris(4-aminophenyl)amine-terephthalaldehyde-based COF constructed through the metal-catalyst free Schiff base approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of massive interest due to their potential application spanning diverse fields such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, drug delivery systems, sensing, and organic electronics. In view of their application-oriented quest, the field of electrochromism marked a significant stride with the reporting of the first electrochromic COF in 2019 [&lt;i&gt;J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 19831&#8211;19838&lt;/i&gt;]. Since then, new and novel COF structures with electrochromic features (denoted as &lt;sup&gt;ec&lt;/sup&gt;COFs) have been searched continuously. Yet, only a handful of &lt;sup&gt;ec&lt;/sup&gt;COFs have been constructed to date. A closer look at these reports suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three-state electrochromism [&lt;i&gt;Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606&#8211;1261&lt;/i&gt;]. Herein, we report four-state electrochromism in tris(4-aminophenyl)amine-terephthalaldehyde (TAPA-PDA)-based COF constructed through the metal-catalyst free Schiff base approach. The four-state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism demonstrated by the TAPA-PDA &lt;sup&gt;ec&lt;/sup&gt;COF opens several futuristic avenues for &lt;sup&gt;ec&lt;/sup&gt;COF&#8242;s end use in flip-flop logic gates, intelligent windows, decorative displays, and energy-saving devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing the Reactivity of Nitroarene Radical Anions to Create Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides by Electrochemical Reductive Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic reduction of 2&#8208;cinnamyl&#8208;substituted nitroarenes under constant current electrolysis affords a broad array of substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides through a mechanism involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom abstraction.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;substituted nitroarenes using a simple, undivided electrochemical cell with non&#8208;precious electrodes to generate nitroarene radical anions was developed. The nitroarene radical anion intermediates participate in 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer reactions to construct quinoline N&#8208;oxides bearing aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, alkenyl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, sulfonyl&#8208;, or carboxyl groups.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone A and Preaustinoid A through Epoxypolyene Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the highly oxidized berkeleyone A and preaustinoid A is reported. Key features include a bioinspired Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed epoxypolyene cyclization of epoxyallylsilane, which effectively constructs a 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic framework containing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core and stereoselectively controlling five chiral centers. Additionally, a tandem alpha&#8208;methenylation and neopentyl alcohol protection is accomplished using Eschenmoser's reagent.







Abstract
A bioinspired Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed epoxypolyene cyclization was developed to construct the tetracyclic framework containing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core and seven chiral centers. The usage of this approach for assembling these natural products of 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic skeleton with bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core is demonstrated by the total synthesis of highly oxidized berkeleyone A and preaustinoid A.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence Nanocrystals with 1710&#8197;nm Excitation for in vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the anti&#8208;Stokes shift luminescence nanocrystals LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Tm@LiErF4@LiYF4, featuring both excitation (1710&#8197;nm) and emission (1532&#8197;nm) wavelengths within the NIR&#8208;II&#8722;L (1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window. The proposed nanocrystals had the potential for in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging, which could be applied for revealing varying metabolic rates of mouse liver and intestines under different physiological conditions.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;Stokes luminescence (ASL) based on lanthanide nanocrystals holds immense promise for in vivo optical imaging and bio&#8208;detection, which benefits from filtered autofluorescence. However, the current longest emission and excitation wavelengths of lanthanide ASL system were shorter than 1200&#8197;nm and 1532&#8197;nm, respectively, which limited tissue penetration depth and caused low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of in vivo imaging due to tissue scattering and water absorption. In this work, we extended the excitation wavelength to 1710&#8197;nm with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) emission up to 1650&#8197;nm through a novel ASL nanocrystal LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%Tm@LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;70&#8201;%Er@LiYF4. Compared with 1532&#8197;nm excited ASL nanoprobes, the 1710&#8197;nm excited nanocrystals could improve in vivo imaging SNR by 12.72&#8197;folds. Based on this excellent imaging performance of the proposed ASL nanoprobes, three&#8208;channel in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging was achieved, which quantitatively revealed metabolic rates of intestinal dynamics and liver enrichment under anesthetized and awake states. This innovative ASL nanoprobes and dynamic multiplexed imaging technology would be conducive to optimizing dosing regimen and treatment plans across various physiological conditions.

         <title>[18F]Trifluoroiodomethane &#8211; Enabling Photoredox&#8208;mediated Radical [18F]Trifluoromethylation for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 4, January 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radiosynthesis of [18F]trifluoroiodomethane is described. CF218FI serves as building block for radical [18F]trifluoromethylation reactions in high molar activity, as exemplified by the Ru&#8208; and photoredox&#8208;mediated synthesis of a range of 18F&#8208;labeled &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl ketones and trifluoromethyl sulfides. This opens new opportunities for the synthesis of [18F]CF3&#8208;containing tracers for positron emission tomography.







Abstract
The development of new tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) is highly dependent on the available synthetic tools for their radiosynthesis. Herein, we present the radiosynthesis and application of [18F]trifluoroiodomethane &#8211; the first reagent for broad scope radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry in high molar activity. CF218FI can be prepared from [18F]fluoroform with 67&#177;5&#8201;% AY and &gt;99&#8201;% RCP. Its synthetic utility is demonstrated by the radiosynthesis of previously unprecedented 18F&#8208;labeled &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl ketones and 18F&#8208;labeled trifluoromethyl sulfides, important motifs that are present in a range of bioactive compounds. Both protocols are Ru&#8208; and photo&#8208;mediated and proceed under mild reaction conditions. They show good functional group tolerance evidenced by the respective reaction scopes and make use of easily obtainable starting materials. The products can be isolated in 8.3&#8211;11.1 GBq/&#956;mol (starting from ca. 5&#160;GBq [18F]fluoride). The applicability to PET tracer synthesis is shown by the radiolabeling of bioactive compounds, such as derivatives of probenecid and febuxostat. In a broader context, this work opens the door to the utilization of radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry for the radiolabeling of PET tracers in high molar activity.

The products can be isolated in 8.3&#8211;11.1 GBq/&#956;mol (starting from ca. 5&#160;GBq [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoride). The applicability to PET tracer synthesis is shown by the radiolabeling of bioactive compounds, such as derivatives of probenecid and febuxostat. In a broader context, this work opens the door to the utilization of radical [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]trifluoromethylation chemistry for the radiolabeling of PET tracers in high molar activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monomer Design Enables Mechanistic Mapping of Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Aromatic Thionolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradable chalcogenide polyesters, e.g., polythioesters (PTEs), typically exhibit improved thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thionolactones, an intrinsically promising yet underexplored approach to accessing PTEs, however, is still limited by: intolerance of metal catalysts, inadequate control over chain growth, and the absence of aromatic system. Monomer design&#8208;boosted mechanistic studies may address the above challenges. Here, we present a new and highly reactive thionolactone synthesized from 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL). Our investigations into polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics have underscored the importance of rapid initiation, eventually leading to the discovery of tetrabutylammonium 2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;thiocarboxylate as a distinctive initiator that enables genuinely controlled and living polymerization of thionolactones. Ultimately, the atropisomerism inherent in BINOL has resulted in the creation of axially chiral PTE materials with tailored molecular weights, enantiomeric compositions, and topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Photosensitizers: Cyanine&#8208;Carborane Salts for Superior Photodynamic Therapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising targeted treatment for cancer. However, current PDT is limited by low tissue penetration, insufficient phototoxicity (toxicity with light irradiation), and undesirable cytotoxicity (toxicity without light irradiation). Here, we report the discovery of cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers (PSs) that harness the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing [cyanine+] with the inertness of [carborane&#8208;]. The implementation of [cyanine+] [carborane&#8208;] salts dramatically enhance the cancer targeting of the PSs and decrease cytotoxicity. We characterize the cellular uptake of the cyanine&#8208;carborane PSs, organelle localization, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the ability to cogenerate multiple ROS species, suppression of pro&#8208;metastatic pathways, and activation of apoptotic pathways. We further demonstrate the ability of optimized PSs to eliminate tumors in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. These newly developed  [cyanine+] [carborane&#8208;] salt PSs introduce a potent therapeutic approach against aggressive breast cancer while decreasing side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Disturbance&#8208;Triggered Instant Crystallization Activating Bioinspired Emissive Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many marine organisms feature sensitive sensory&#8208;perceptual systems to sense the surrounding environment and respond to disturbance with intense bioluminescence. However, it remains a great challenge to develop artificial materials that can sense external disturbance and simultaneously activate intense luminescence, although such materials are attractive for visual sensing and intelligent displays. Herein, we present a new class of bioinspired smart gels constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and fluorophores containing heterogenic atoms. Upon external disturbance, the composite gels undergo an instant and reversible soft&#8208;rigid state transition, simultaneously turning on intense fluorescence and activating ultralong afterglow emission with a maximum lifetime of 877.15 ms. The experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the disturbance&#8208;induced luminescence mainly results from the geometrical confinement of aggregated fluorophores and enhanced molecular interactions to immensely suppress the non&#8208;radiative dissipation. Given their versatile and sensitive disturbance&#8208;responsiveness, dynamic interactive painting and 3D smart optical displays are demonstrated. This study paves a new avenue to achieve disturbance&#8208;sensing soft materials and promotes the development of smart visual sensors and interactive optical displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Based on Host&#8208;guest Strategy and Different Viologen Derivatives for Organic Amines Sensing and Information Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The encapsulation of viologen derivatives in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct host&#8208;guest materials has been widely discussed owing to their distinctive spatial arrangement and physical/chemical properties. Herein, three new photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8208;3) have been successfully synthesized by 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) ligand as well as three different viologen derivatives based on host&#8208;guest strategy. Remarkably, NWM&#8208;1&#8208;3 exhibit a notable reversible photochromism change from yellow to green under 365 nm UV irradiation. The distance between the electron&#8208;deficient N atom in the viologens and the electron&#8208;rich carboxylate oxygens satisfies the electron transfer pathway, and thus electron transfer (ET) occurs upon irradiation, producing intermolecular viologen radicals. NWM&#8208;1 is able to produce colored responses to different volatile amines by ET and can be recognizable to the naked eye. Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) analysis and comparative experiments have demonstrated that the host&#8208;guest strategy significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of viologens, thereby achieving superior amine sensing performance. NWM&#8208;2 and 3 have been realized by multiple methods, such as inkjet printing, fingerprint, and QR codes for anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides new host&#8208;guest strategy for designing highly sensitive photochromic materials and color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials, advancing the development of assembled photochromic materials closer to commercialization.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron has been successfully developed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. The incorporation of Fe effectively lowered the center of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of the lattice oxygen within the nanocrystals, significantly attenuating the interaction between lattice oxygen and *CH3 intermediate.







Abstract
An inevitable overoxidation process is considered as one of the most challenging problems in the direct conversion of methane (CH4) to methanol (CH3OH), which is limited by the uncontrollable cracking of key intermediates. Herein, we have successfully constructed a photocatalyst, the Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron (Fe/ZnOHP), for the highly selective photoconversion of CH4 to CH3OH under mild conditions. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the introduction of Fe was able to decrease the energy level of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of lattice oxygen in ZnO nanocrystals. This passivation effect greatly weakened the interaction between *CH3 and lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the conversion of *CH3O to *CH3 intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *CH3O. As a result, Fe/ZnOHP exhibited excellent CH3OH generation rate (ca. 1009&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (ca. 96&#8201;%) in the photocatalytic conversion of CH4 at room temperature and low pressure.

         <title>Leveraging Iron in the Electrolyte to Improve Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled introduction of iron ions into the electrolyte, coupled with a suitable host material to facilitate in situ iron deposition, opens new strategies for creating highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces to continuously catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction at a steady rate, thereby breaking the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and material stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high&#8208;performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non&#8208;acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fen+ species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fen+ deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long&#8208;term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe(aq.) incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fen+ at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.

         <title>Observation of the Smallest Three&#8208;Dimensional Neutral Boron Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoionization efficiency spectrum of B9 was measured by using VUV free electron laser. B9 was characterized to be the smallest 3D neutral boron cluster with a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of B9&#8208;. A single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond between the capping atoms is found to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9.







Abstract
Despite major progress in the investigation of boron cluster anions, direct experimental study of neutral boron clusters remains a significant challenge because of the difficulty in size selection. Here we report a size&#8208;specific study of the neutral B9 cluster using threshold photoionization with a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser. The ionization potential of B9 is measured to be 8.45&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and it is found to have a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of the B9&#8208; anionic cluster. Chemical bonding analyses reveal superior stability of the bipyramidal structure arising from delocalized &#963; and &#960; bonding interactions within the B7 ring and between the B7 ring and the capping atoms. Photoionization of B9 breaks the single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms, which undergo off&#8208;axis distortion to enhance interactions with the B7 ring in the singlet ground state of B9+. The single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms appears to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9. This work opens avenues for direct size&#8208;dependent experimental studies of a large variety of neutral boron clusters to explore the stepwise development of network structures.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway in Dual Dynamic Covalent Polymeric Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;One monomer for two materials&#8221;: Dual dynamic covalent chemistries diversify the pathway of molecular self&#8208;assembly and produce distinct polymeric materials as a function of evaporation rate.







Abstract
Kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly is garnering increasing interest in the field of supramolecular polymers and materials, yet examples involving dynamic covalent exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here we report an unexpected dynamic covalent polymeric system whose aqueous self&#8208;assembly pathway is strongly influenced by the kinetics of evaporation of water. The key design is to integrate dual dynamic covalent bonds&#8212;including disulfide bonds and boroxine/borate&#8212;into a dynamic equilibrium system of monomers, polymers, and materials. This dual dynamic covalent design allows polymer growth and crosslinking to occur with the same spatiotemporal characteristics, governed solely by solvent evaporation. We found that a single building block can assemble into two distinct types of polymeric materials, each characterized by unique crosslinking topologies, orders, solubility, and macroscopic properties. The dual dynamic nature of the materials imparts them with intrinsic reconfigurability, such as interfacial repairability and close&#8208;loop chemical recyclability.

         <title>Interfacial Water Orientation in Neutral Oxygen Catalysis for Reversible Ampere&#8208;Scale Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant breakthrough in neutral oxygen catalysis was achieved by altering the orientation of water molecules from conventional O&#8208;down to unexpected H&#8208;down in the hydrogen bond network.







Abstract
The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H&#8208;down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record&#8208;breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10&#8197;mA = 0.85/1.65&#8201;V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500&#8197;h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere&#8208;scale zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0&#8201;A and 1.0&#8201;Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Defluorinative C&#8722;O Coupling between Trifluoromethylarenes and Alcohols via Copper Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CF2O&#8208;compounds are prepared via photoinduced, Cu&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative coupling between readily available trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. A molecule displaying liquid crystal property was synthesized through this convergent and step&#8208;economical method. Mechanistic studies suggested that a homoleptic Cu&#8208;bisphosphine complex serves as the photocatalyst, and the two salt additives are crucial in orchestrating this dual&#8208;cycle system.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8722;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF2OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate difluorobenzyliodide (ArCF2I) products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine&#8208;bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF2I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF2&#8901; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8722;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8722;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated. This dual&#8208;role copper catalyst demonstrates the power of base metal photoredox catalysis in achieving both substrate activation and chemical bond formation via a single catalytic system.

         <title>Proximal Oblique&#8208;Packing of Heptamethine Cyanines through Spiro&#8208;Connection Boosts Triplet State Generation in Near&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped packing) of heptamethine cyanine dimer can induce multi&#8208;channel ultrafast triplet state generation with the rate constants up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, leading a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet dyes are the cornerstones of cutting&#8208;edge biomedical and material applications. The difficulty in rational development of triplet dyes increases exponentially as the absorption wavelength shifts deeper into the NIR range. Although classical H&#8208;/J&#8208;typed packing of NIR dyes has the potential to enhance intersystem crossing (ISC) compared with that in single&#8208;chromophore dyes, the triplet state quantum yields remain limited in such strategy. Herein, proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped) heptamethine cyanines (SZ780) through spiro&#8208;connection were achieved. Multi&#8208;channel ultrafast ISC were direct observed in SZ780 and a record high ISC rate constant (up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) is registered among all the reported NIR triplet dyes. SZ780 exhibits a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%) and nearly threefold increase compared to that of the H&#8208;packed dimer (SC780) (6.7&#8201;%). Moreover, SZ780 efficiently generates singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, inducing cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. These findings demonstrate that constructing V&#8208;aggregated dyes system by spiro&#8208;connection offers a powerful approach for the design of high&#8208;performance NIR triplet sensitizers.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Drug for the Self&#8208;Checking of Mitophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a innovative &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy, exemplified by the mitophagy self&#8208;check drug. This strategy integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting into a single small&#8208;molecule drug, effectively addressing the challenges associated with conventional marker interference in drug evaluation.







Abstract
Mitophagy, particularly in the context of drugs that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), represents a critical focus in pharmacology. However, the discovery and evaluation of MMP&#8208;disrupting drugs are often hampered using commercially available marker molecules that target similar or identical zones. These markers can significantly interfere with, obscure, or amplify the functional effects of MMP&#8208;targeting drugs, frequently leading to clinical failures. In response to this challenge, we propose a &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy that integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting within a single small&#8208;molecule drug. We have developed a novel proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept mitophagy self&#8208;check drug (MitoSC) that exhibits dual&#8208;color and dual&#8208;localization properties. The functional component of this system is a variable MitoSC that disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) homeostasis, thereby inducing mitophagy. Upon activation, this component transforms into a blue&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;fun) specifically within the mitochondrial target zone. Concurrently, the biological reporting component is represented by a red&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;rep) that localizes to lysosomes, the non&#8208;target zone. As mitophagy progresses, the fluorescent signals from MitoSC&#8208;rep (lysosomes) and MitoSC&#8208;fun (mitochondria) converge, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the mitophagic process. This strategy combines potent drug functionality with robust biological reporting, thereby minimizing interference and eliminating the complexities associated with external detection. Our findings underscore the potential of a single&#8208;molecule drug to exert target&#8208;zone specific actions while simultaneously providing non&#8208;target zone self&#8208;checking, offering a new perspective for drug design.

         <title>A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy to Simultaneously Boost the Site Density and Turnover Frequency of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with NH4I vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process leads to the simultaneous improvements in the turnover frequency via the I&#8208;doping induced electronic structure tuning and site density via the etching of carbon substrate by the in&#8197;situ generated NH3, resulting in superior oxygen reduction activity in both acidic and alkaline media.







Abstract
Site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) are the two fundamental kinetic descriptors that determine the oxygen reduction activity of iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts that represent the most promising alternatives to precious and scarce platinum. However, it remains a grand challenge to simultaneously optimize these two parameters in a single Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Here we show that treating a typical Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with ammonium iodine (NH4I) vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process not only increases the surface area and porosity of the catalyst (and thus enhanced exposure of active sites) via the etching effect of the in&#8197;situ released NH3, but also regulates the electronic structure of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C moieties by the iodine dopants incorporated into the carbon matrix. As a result, the NH4I&#8208;treated Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst possesses both high values in the SD of 2.15&#215;1019 sites g&#8722;1 (&#215;2 enhancement compared to the untreated counterpart) and TOF of 3.71 electrons site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (&#215;3 enhancement) that correspond to a high mass activity of 12.78 A g&#8722;1, as determined by in&#8197;situ nitrite stripping technique. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits an excellent oxygen reduction activity in base with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.924&#8201;V and acceptable activity in acid with E1/2 =0.795&#8201;V, and superior power density of 249.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Showing an Ion&#8208;Triggered Chiroptical Switching Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight phenyl groups were fused into carbazole to give a novel &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicene. Boron incorporation furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene showing an ion&#8208;triggered chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species with the change in the color and glum values.







Abstract
Intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)carbazole provided a bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole, while that of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;diphenylcarbazole afforded a bis(quaterphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole. Borylation of the latter furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene binding a fluoride anion via a structural change from the three&#8208;coordinate boron to the four&#8208;coordinate boron. The anionic charge derived from the fluoride anion is stabilized over the expanded &#960;&#8208;framework, which leads to the high binding constant (Ka) of 1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The four&#8208;coordinate boron species was converted back to the parent three&#8208;coordinate boron species with Ag+, and the chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species has been achieved via the ion recognition with the change in the color and glum values.

         <title>Fluorescent Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a comprehensive summary of the synthesis, properties, and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes (FMAs) composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons that have emerged in the past decade. The FMAs are categorized on the basis of the different building blocks incorporated.







Abstract
Fluorescent macrocyclic arenes have attracted increasing interest in macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry due to their exceptional photophysical properties and versatile applications. Classical macrocyclic arenes modified with fluorescent groups at the upper or bottom rims have long provided valuable platforms across various fields. Recently, a large number of novel fluorescent macrocyclic arenes directly composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic building blocks including naphthalene, anthracene, tetraphenylethene, pyrene, fluorene, carbazole, acridan, phenothiazine, coumarin, triphenylamine, benzothiadiazole and so on, have been reported, and they have shown specific fluorescent property, and also exhibited broad applications in molecular recognition, sensing, bioimaging and functional materials. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes containing polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons emerged in the past decade. By categorizing these fluorescent macrocyclic arenes based on the different building blocks, this review provides a comprehensive summary of their synthesis, properties and applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Water Purification by Template&#8208;Free Nanoconfined Catalysts Derived from Municipal Sludge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free approach transforms municipal sludge into high&#8208;performance nanoconfined catalysts by leveraging selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion to manipulate micro&#8208;mesoporous structures. Atomically dispersed Fe centers are confined, resulting in a shift of reaction mechanism and achieving a impressive 261&#8208;fold increase in catalytic pollutant degradation. This scalable method not only tackles waste management but also offers a sustainable route for manufacturing advanced catalysts, contributing to water purification and global waste upcycling efforts.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement at the interface of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysts offers promising avenues for advancing oxidation processes in water purification. Herein, we introduce a template&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing nanoconfined catalysts from municipal sludge (S&#8208;NCCs), specifically engineered to optimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and utilization for rapid pollutant degradation. Using selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion, we create an architecture that confines atomically dispersed Fe centers within a micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon matrix in situ. This method maximizes the utilization of silicon and aluminum content from sludge, prevents metal agglomeration, and precisely regulates the chemical environment of Fe active sites. As a result, the S&#8208;NCCs promote a transition from nonradical to hybrid radical/nonradical reaction mechanisms, significantly enhancing ROS efficiency, stability, and pollutant degradation rates. These catalysts demonstrate exceptional pollutant removal performance, achieving a 261&#8208;fold increase in degradation efficiency for compounds such as phenol and sulfamethoxazole compared to unconfined analogs, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of nanoconfined catalysis in environmental applications, providing an effective and scalable solution for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Tailored Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Bilayer SEI with Proton Holder Feature for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer/P&#8722;F SEI with proton holder feature is designed to stabilize Zn anode at high current densities and areal capacities. The inner ZnF2 has high stiffness and strength, effectively suppressing Zn dendrites. The outer polyaniline (PANI) regulates current distribution across the Zn surface and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Meanwhile, the =N&#8722; group in PANI serves as a reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER.







Abstract
Conventional solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries mainly acts as a physical barrier to prevent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while such SEI is prone to structural deterioration stemming from uneven Zn deposition at high current densities. Herein, we propose an in situ structural design of polymer&#8208;inorganic bilayer SEI with a proton holder feature by aniline&#8208;modulated electrolytes. The Zn(OTF)2 exhibits a lower LUMO energy level in comparison to aniline, resulting in the formation of a bilayer structure characterized by an inner ZnF2 layer and an outer polyaniline (PANI) layer. The ZnF2 with high stiffness and strength effectively suppresses Zn dendrites. Meanwhile, the PANI regulates the current distribution, minimizing the concentration gradient, and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Furthermore, the =N&#8722; in PANI is capable of reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER. With this bilayer SEI, the Zn anode achieves an impressive cycle life of 126&#8197;h under 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 &amp; 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (depth of discharge, DOD=70.8&#8201;%), solving the bottleneck of single&#8208;layer inorganic SEI that could not be cycled under these conditions. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;NaVO pouch battery with bilayer SEI exhibits a high capacity of 1.2&#8197;Ah and a cycle life of 350&#8197;h with 78&#8201;% capacity retention. At &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the same battery delivers a capacity of 335&#8197;mAh and a cycle life of 507&#8197;h with 72&#8201;% capacity retention, attributed to the modulation mechanism of the hydrogen bonding in the electrolyte. Our findings offer profound insights into the design of SEI with tailored structure and functionality, paving the way for the next generation of advanced high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>An sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fusing Lipid Droplets and Engineered Macrophage Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages, promoting their antitumor activation. The mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induces lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. The intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited CT26 tumor progression.







Abstract
Engineered immune cell therapy has proven to be a transformative cancer treatment despite the challenges of its prohibitive costs and manufacturing complexity. In this study, we propose a concise &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages. Because of the integration of hydrophobic alkyl chains and &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, the mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induced lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, thus promoting their antitumor classical activation. Intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited tumor progression. These results represent the first report of room&#8208;temperature synthesis of sp2C&#8208;conjugated COFs for engineered immune cell therapy, providing a new perspective for the development of therapeutic immune cells via organelle manipulation.

The mildly synthesized sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C-conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) &lt;b&gt;UM-101&lt;/b&gt; induces lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineered immune cell therapy has proven to be a transformative cancer treatment despite the challenges of its prohibitive costs and manufacturing complexity. In this study, we propose a concise &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages. Because of the integration of hydrophobic alkyl chains and &#960;-conjugated structures, the mildly synthesized sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C-conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) &lt;b&gt;UM-101&lt;/b&gt; induced lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, thus promoting their antitumor classical activation. Intravenous injection of &lt;b&gt;UM-101&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited tumor progression. These results represent the first report of room-temperature synthesis of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C-conjugated COFs for engineered immune cell therapy, providing a new perspective for the development of therapeutic immune cells via organelle manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Spiropyran Coacervates as Dual&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Switchable Reactive Oxygen Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical reactions of the spiropyran coacervates in aqueous solution, in cells, and in animals enable dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;switchable ROS generation and cancer treatment.







Abstract
Low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds of certain structural features may form coacervates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates can enter mammalian cells and affect cellular physiology. Controlling the properties of the coacervates inside cells, however, is a challenge. Here, we report photochemical reactions of spiropyran (SP)&#8208;based coacervates with two wavelengths of light, in vitro, in the cell, and in animals, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photo&#8208;controlled cell killing. We identify an SP&#8208;containing compound, SP&#8208;PEG8&#8208;SP, that forms coacervates (SP&#8208;C) in the aqueous solution. Photo illumination by a UV light triggers the isomerization of SP to merocyanine (MC), switching SP&#8208;C to the fluorescent coacervates MC&#8208;C. A visible light converts MC&#8208;C back to SP&#8208;C and induces ROS generation. Notably, coacervate formation increases the compound's ROS generation efficiency. The SP&#8208;C/MC&#8208;C coacervate system (collectively called spiropyran coacervates) can spontaneously enter cells, and a dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;controlled reversible on/off switch and spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved ROS production is realized within the cytoplasm. Light&#8208;induced ROS generation leads to cytotoxicity to cancer cells, tumor organoids, and tumors in vivo, supporting spiropyran coacervates&#8217; potential use as coacervate photosensitizers in photodynamic therapies.

         <title>Contrasting Mechanochromic Luminescence of Enantiopure and Racemic Pyrenylprolinamides: Elucidating Solid&#8208;State Excimer Orientation by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) has been observed for enantiopure and racemic crystals of pyrenylprolinamides with different substituents. Enantiopure crystals exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and mechanochromic CPL was achieved due to the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded excimers in the amorphous state. For the first time, the amorphous&#8208;state CPL was elucidated based on the excimer chirality rule.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) have independently made substantial progress in recent years. However, the exploration of MCL in solid&#8208;state CPL materials, which holds practical significance, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the MCL properties of readily accessible chiral pyrenylprolinamides bearing tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 2,2,2&#8208;trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc) groups. Enantiopure crystals of the Boc derivative display a greater MCL wavelength shift than racemic crystals, while the Troc derivative exhibit the opposite trend. Most notably, the enantiopure crystals show mechanochromic CPL. Unlike in previous examples, where CPL is quenched upon amorphization, robust CPL spectra were observed even in the amorphous states. By applying the excimer chirality rule, we have, for the first time, acquired insights into the excited&#8208;state structures within mechanically generated amorphous states. These findings offer a novel design strategy for developing mechanochromic CPL materials, paving the way for the future advancements in this emerging field.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse geometries has captivated considerable interest due to their manifestation of novel and extraordinary properties. While much progress has been made in shaping regular polyhedral single&#8208;crystal MOFs, the creation of more complex, topologically intricate nanostructures remains a largely unexplored frontier. Here, we present a refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach to fabricate a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods. Our method involves the selective growth of six mSiO2 nanoplates on the {100} facets of ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes, forming the cubic&#8208;shaped ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids, with the concurrent etching of the {110} facets of initial ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes. By fine&#8208;tuning this balance between the growth and etching, we achieved precise morphological control, transforming cubic nanohybrids into intricate hexapods nanohybrids. Additionally, secondary epitaxial growth of homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;MOFs on these hybrids led to ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2&amp;MOF composites with six mSiO2 inlays. Finally, selective alkaline etching of the mSiO2 compartments result in single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles with unprecedented and sophisticated morphologies, such as hexapods, nested nanocages, octopods.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Allosteric Regulation of Catalysis by Effector Switching in a Pt2L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexity of allosteric enzymatic regulation continues to inspire synthetic chemists seeking to emulate interconnected biological systems. In this work, a Pt2L4&#160;cage capable of catalyzing the cyclization reaction of an alkynoic tosyl amide is orthogonally coupled to a diacid&#8208;catalyzed carbodiimide&#8208;hydration cycle. This new Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction is demonstrated to exhibit electronic regulation by inclusion of different guest effectors. The orthogonal diacid&#8208;catalyzed carbodiimide hydration cycle produces transiently diverse guests that influence the rate of the Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction to different extents. Further complexity can be introduced to the system through displacing the transiently&#8208;formed, weakly bound anhydride guest with the stronger binding fumaronitrile, affecting the catalytic rate to a larger extent for the duration of the orthogonal reaction cycle. The modulation of a Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction can thus be regulated transiently over the course of the reaction&#8212;either up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulating the turnover frequency (TOF)&#8212;via coupling with a temporally controllable orthogonal process. This study demonstrates that principles of allosteric enzymatic regulation can also be applied to simple artificial systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Catalytic Vertex Wall Chemistry in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) because of their unique structural properties and notable stability. To enhance both catalytic activity and selectivity, a variety of linkers and linkages have been investigated in efforts to precisely engineer COFs. However, the impact of vertex structures within COFs on ORR catalysis remains largely underexplored. Here, to modulate COF catalytic performance, we introduce tunable catalytic vertex wall chemistry by introducing diverse triazine and thiophene units. The catalytic vertex wall approach allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic surface states, leading to improved intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerated ORR activity. Remarkably, the engineered COF achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V, surpassing COFs modified by linker or linkage strategies. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhanced activity arises from the strong binding affinity of OOH* intermediates to carbon atoms adjacent to the thiophene vertex, facilitating OOH* reduction to a O2 molecule, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the ORR. These findings reveal the pivotal role of vertex wall engineering in conjugated COF frameworks, and offer critical insights to advance COFs design toward superior ORR performance.</dc:description>

Insert text for Table of Contents here. Two&#8208; and threefold&#8208;fused bipolar dyes based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide and various electron&#8208;rich motifs were synthesized by a facile and efficient cascade process with cesium carbonate. These polyaromatic systems could not be obtained by transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
The development of straightforward synthetic methods for photoactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that avoid Pd&#8208;catalyzed or radical&#8208;based processes remains a challenge. Such methods are essential to reducing the cost and environmental impact of organic photodevices. In this work, we present a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for creating novel bipolar PAHs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which are not accessible via conventional Pd&#8208;catalyzed routes. Our cascade process operates exclusively under basic conditions, utilizing cesium carbonate and molecular sieves to facilitate the coupling of electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;fluoronaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide with halogenated electron&#8208;rich moieties. This results in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective formation of new 6&#8208; and/or 5&#8208;membered conjugated rings via consecutive SNAr reactions, as confirmed through experimental and computational studies. The resulting PAHs exhibit strong emissive properties, with quantum yields ranging from 34&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. This work provides a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for producing novel semiconducting materials, offering a new framework for designing bipolar PAHs with distinct optical characteristics.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Metal&#8208;Organic Layer on Polyoxometalate&#8208;etching Cu2O to Boost CO2 Reduction with High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POM&#8208;etching for in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic layer can simultaneously incorporate electron sponge and protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites exhibit exceptional robustness and achieve efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH with a yield 55 times higher than that of binary Cu2O@HKUST.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM=PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt;x&#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60&#8197;h without noticeable activity loss.

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H&#8208;bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).







Abstract
The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr&#8208;CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs) with different positively charged groups were fabricated. The strong confinement effect affords ultrahigh H3PO4 retention capability under hydration condition, and the suitable H&#8208;bond length between H3PO4 and highly interconnected H&#8208;bond network enables ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport.







Abstract
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8722;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7&#8201;&#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2 Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at Ampere&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use DFT calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni&#8208;RuO2 is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO2 to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface with a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.







Abstract
Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over a 1000&#8208;hour period.

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the chemical activity of isolated metal atoms confined in graphene on Ni(111), using carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. At room temperature, CO stably adsorbs on Co but not on Ni. Electronic descriptors clarify this behavior, offering valuable insights for designing graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorescence Behavior of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes from the Perspective of Excited State Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes has been synthesized. The doped PMMA films demonstrate a light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence phenomenon. Our research reveals that these complexes exhibit a long phosphorescence lifetime, a high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate, and significant phosphorescence intensity. These three characteristics enable the phosphorescence of the CMA complex&#8208;doped films to be activated by light, allowing for a change in the emission color of the films.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have diverse applications in luminescence, imaging and sensing. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of CMA complexes, which were subsequently doped into a PMMA host. These materials demonstrate light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence, attributed to their long intrinsic triplet state lifetime (&#964;P,int, in the &#956;s&#8208;ms scale), high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant (kISC, up to 107&#8197;s&#8722;1), and bright phosphorescence. The extended &#964;P,int, and elevated kISC facilitate efficient sensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is rapidly consumed by the host material, creating a localized anaerobic environment conducive to bright phosphorescence emission. The Sn&#8208;T1 process exhibits a large spin&#8208;orbital coupling matrix element (SOCME) value, while the SOCME value between T1 and S0 is comparatively smaller, resulting in a large kISC and long &#964;P,int, Computational results indicate that the hole&#8208;electron configuration in the lowest triplet state exhibits low contributions from gold. Based on the dynamic phosphorescence properties, an encryption material capable of achieving a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; effect was developed. This work illustrates that those phosphorescent emitters with minimal heavy atom contribution can produce dynamic phosphorescent phenomena, providing a novel strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive phosphorescent materials.

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>

Thermoplastic elastomers: Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene, ethylene butadiene rubber and highly crystalline polyethylene segments are prepared using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization. They display low&#8208;viscosity above the melting point of PE and high elastic performances upon crystallization of PE segments.







Abstract
Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt;150&#8201;&#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes catalyse amide formation in an environmentally friendly manner. This study advances the application of ABS by integrating these enzymes with other compatible biocatalysts, creating enantioselective and scalable cascade reactions to produce valuable amide products from abundant nitrile precursors. Furthermore, two innovative methods for C&#8722;H bond amidation of aromatic compounds are introduced.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.

         <title>Isolation and Structure Elucidation of the Heterocumulene Anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; (L=CO, CS, N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cumulated 5&#8208;atomic cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and thioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722; were synthesized from the metalated ylide and ketenyl anion, respectively. Both anions exhibit unexpected stability, but with notable structural differences. While the cyanodiazomethanide features a distinctly bent geometry, the thioketenyl anion was found to be linear, which can be explained by to the stronger &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the CS ligand.







Abstract
Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8722; anion was sufficiently stable at 0&#8201;&#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Blue Narrowband OLED Devices with External Quantum Efficiency Beyond 35&#8201;% through Horizontal Dipole Orientation Induced by Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host (8CzTPS) with a strong positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and a dendritic emitter (D2&#8208;DBN) with multiple negative ESP sites was used to induce a high horizontal dipole orientation of 83.0&#8201;% for the emitter in solution&#8208;processed films. The resulting blue narrowband device realizes an external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) device has drawn great attention due to their outstanding efficiency and color purity. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed MR&#8208;TADF devices is still far behind their vacuum&#8208;deposited counterparts, due to the uncontrollable horizontal emitting dipole orientation for emitters during solution process, resulting in low light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy namely electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host with high positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and dendritic emitter with multiple negative ESP sites, which could induce high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;||) up to 83.0&#8201;% in solution&#8208;processed films. For this couple, the largest plane of dendritic host tends to anchor on the substrate, and thus the strong positive electrostatic site mainly lies at the exposed tetraphenylsilicon, which could electrostatically attract the multiple negative electrostatic sites of the dendritic emitter, realizing horizontal dipole orientation. Moreover, the highly twisted structure of dendritic host and dendron encapsulation of emitter could effectively suppress aggregation, leading a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.6&#8201;%. As a result, the solution&#8208;processed blue MR&#8208;TADF devices exhibit a record&#8208;break external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;%, as well as narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.176).

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides Directed by a Removable, Backbone&#8208;Inserted Amidoxime Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides has been developed, directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. The backbone&#8208;installed directing group facilitates site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides, including at internal residues. Removal of the amidoxime ether generates the parent amide enabling a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted considerable attention as a pathway to late&#8208;stage modification of peptides. Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including unprecedented functionalization of internal residues of native peptides. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers Incorporating Shape&#8208;Persistent Cyclobenzoin Macrocycles for Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic porous organic polymer has been synthesized for the efficient separation of organic solvents. The resulting polymer exhibits high uptake capacities for small solvents, correlating with their kinetic diameters, and effectively differentiates between xylene isomers. These findings highlight the potential of porous organic polymers in advanced solvent separation technologies.







Abstract
The recovery and separation of organic solvents is highly important for the chemical industry and environmental protection. In this context, porous organic polymers (POPs) have significant potential owing to the possibility of integrating shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units with high guest selectivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a macrocyclic porous organic polymer (np&#8208;POP) and the corresponding model compound by reacting the cyclotetrabenzil naphthalene octaketone macrocycle with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene and 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene, respectively, under solvothermal conditions. Co&#8208;crystallization of the macrocycle and the model compound with various solvent molecules revealed their size&#8208;selective inclusion within the macrocycle. Building on this finding, the np&#8208;POP with a hierarchical pore structure and a surface area of 579&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 showed solvent uptake strongly correlated with their kinetic diameters. Solvents with kinetic diameters below 0.6&#8197;nm &#8211; such as acetonitrile and dichloromethane &#8211; showed high uptake capacities exceeding 7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Xylene separation tests revealed a high overall uptake (~34&#8197;wt&#8201;%), with o&#8208;xylene displaying a significantly lower uptake (~10&#8197;wt&#8201;% less than other isomers), demonstrating the possibility of size and shape selective separation of organic solvents.

         <title>Tunable Organic&#8208;Inorganic p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d Electron Conjugation Triggers d&#8208;&#960; Hybridization in Quinonized MnO2 Superlattice toward Ultrastable and High&#8208;Rate Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The tunable organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d electron conjugation of quinonized superlattice, inducing more dxy orbitals occupancy, more polarons near Fermi level, the downshift of O p band center, and reinforced Mn&#8722;O &#960;&#8208;type orbitals hybrid, which successively contributes to the significant improvement of electrochemical activity, diffusion kinetics of Zn2+ and structure stability.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with two&#8208;electron transfer harvest high energy density, high working voltage, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Zn2+ as the dominant charge carriers suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the strong Zn2+&#8722;MnO2 coulombic interaction, which is also the origin of pestilent MnO2 lattice deformation and performance degradation. Current studies particularly involve H+ insertion&#8208;dominating chemistry, where the long&#8208;term cycle stability remains challenging due to the accumulative Zn2+ insertion and structural collapse. Herein, a simultaneously enhanced and stabilized Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry is proposed by the quinone&#8208;hybridized MnO2 superlattice, a first&#8208;of&#8208;this&#8208;kind structure with a distinctive organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d conjugation, which enables a tunable interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization. Theoretical and experimental results substantiate that the interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization triggers the enhancement of polarons occupancy near Fermi level, the downward shift of O p&#8208;band center, the elevated Mn t2g occupation and thus improved [MnO6] stability upon unprecedentedly high Zn2+ contribution. The notable d&#8208;&#960; hybridization endows MnO2 superlattice an ultrahigh specific capacity (435.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) with substantially enhanced rate performance. Our findings enlighten a new paradigm in the adjustment of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry towards high&#8208;performance rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol APR for Sustainable PE Hydrogenolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerizing plastic waste through hydrogen&#8208;based processes, such as hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, presents a promising solution for converting plastics into liquid fuels. However, conventional hydrogen production methods rely heavily on fossil fuels, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste hydrogenolysis that utilizes in situ hydrogen generated via the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol, a biomass&#8208;derived chemical offering a more sustainable alternative. Our results show that a bimetallic Ru&#8208;Pt/TiO2 catalyst achieved high conversion (85.1%) and selectivity (81.0%) towards liquid fuels and lubricant oils in a tandem process combining polyethylene (PE) hydrogenolysis and methanol APR. By tuning the metal loading, we identified that Pt enhances hydrogen production through methanol APR, while Ru drives C&#8211;C bond cleavage, which is crucial for PE hydrogenolysis. Isotope labeling analysis confirmed that hydrogen generated from methanol APR is effectively utilized in the PE hydrogenolysis reaction. This method was also successfully applied to post&#8208;consumer polyolefin waste, with selectivity toward valuable products ranging from 75.0% to 88.9%. This study highlights an innovative strategy to reduce reliance on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen in plastic waste depolymerization, promoting both sustainability and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Actinide Oxo&#8208;Bond Manipulation in Actinyl Thiacalix[4]arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An = U, Np, Pu).  The thioether calixarene TC4A (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to [AnO2]n+ (An = U, Np) forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans&#8208;oxo groups. The &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, [A]2[UO2(TC4A)] (A = [Li(DME)2], HNEt3) and [HNEt3]2[NpO2(TC4A)], enable selective oxo chemistry. Silylation of the UVI oxo groups by bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrazine occurs first at only the unencapsulated exo oxo and only one silylation is needed to enable migration of the endo oxo out of the cone, whereupon a second silylation affords the stable UIV cis&#8208;bis(siloxide) [A]2[U(OSiMe3)2(TC4A)]. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate&#160;oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8208; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically, at only 23 kcal.mol&#8208;1 in energy above the classical trans dioxo. The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as&#8208;yet unseen uranyl geometry, with further bonding in the TC4A U&#8208;OAr groups stabilizing the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of a calculated cis[UO2(TC4A)]2&#8208; in this ligand framework.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An = U, Np, Pu).  The thioether calixarene TC4A (4-tert-butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to [AnO2]n+ (An = U, Np) forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans-oxo groups.

         <title>Aluminadichalcogeniranes and Aluminatrichalcogenetanes: Heavier Analogs of Dioxiranes and Trioxetanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dioxiranes and their heavier chalcogen analogs have long been recognized as pivotal reagents and intermediates in synthetic chemistry, while trioxetanes have largely remained theoretical constructs. In this work, we present the synthesis of neutral, isoelectronic aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, specifically aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and a mixed Se/Te analog of aluminatrichalcogenetane. These compounds, featuring strained AlCh2 and AlCh3 ring (Ch = Se, Te), exhibit significant polarization between the aluminum and chalcogen components. Reactivity studies have revealed that both aluminadiselenirane and aluminaditellurirane show pronounced ambiphilic behavior when interacting with proximal substrates, undergoing facile ring&#8208;opening (cyclo)additions. Additionally, the coordination chemistry of aluminatriselenetane with a Lewis acid has been documented. These investigations not only broaden the repertoire of unique main group species but also provide access to heterocyclic structures that present synthetic challenges through conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Stepwise Reduction of Aliphatic Carboxylic Esters to Aldehydes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes and alcohols is a fundamental functional group transformation in chemistry. However, the inertness of carbonyl group and the instability of ketyl radical anion intermediate impede the reduction of carboxylic esters via photochemical strategy. Herein, we described the reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters with synergistic dual photocatalysis via phenolate&#8208;catalyzed single electron transfer process and thiol&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer process. The competitive back electron transfer process was effectively inhibited by protonation of the ketyl&#8208;type radical anion. This protocol enabled the efficient reduction of carboxylic esters to alcohols under mild conditions. By interruption of the reduction with prolinol, the step&#8208;controlled reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes was accomplished. The developed process was also successfully applied to the preparation of deuterated alcohols and aldehydes from esters with D2O as the deuterium source.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs), a novel class of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron&#8208;rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high&#8208;mobility semiconducting c&#8208;CPs. Currently,&#160;c&#8208;CPs incorporating selenium&#8208;substituted ligands remain scarce. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraseleno&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;Se coordination polymer, Ag4TSHQ. Ag4TSHQ exhibits room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6 S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag4TTHQ (TTHQ = tetrathiol&#8208;hydroxyquinone), enabling precise bandgap modulation from 0.6 eV to 1.5 eV via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. Time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag4TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350 cm2/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag4TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340 F/g&#8212;significantly outperforming Ag4TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294 F/g. These findings underscore the potential of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs for optoelectronic applications and energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Olympic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catenated networks exclusively composed of intertwining rings were first envisioned as "Olympic gels"&#160;by Pierre&#8208;Gilles de Gennes four decades ago but have not been successfully prepared in artificial materials yet due to the challenge in synthesis. Herein, we present a bio&#8208;inspired, evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy to address this issue. In our design, the evaporation of liquid catalysts that induce ring&#8208;chain equilibrium of polymer systems drives macrocycles to encounter and assists their catenation through reversible cyclization. Complete removal of liquid catalysts stabilizes the resulting ring&#8208;interlocked networks by deactivating the catenation&#8208;decatenation process. The strategy is demonstrated by the system of hydroxyethyl lipoate (LpHE) and dimethyl formamide (DMF). The results indicate that DMF evaporation leads to the formation of global LpHE polycatenane networks. This evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy displays versatility in several tested cyclic monomers, highlighting its potential as a general approach to fabricate ring&#8208;interlocked elastomers and topologically intricate materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Super Strong Bonding at the interface between ETL and Perovskite for Robust Flexible Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated great potential for flexible optoelectronic devices due to their superior optoelectronic properties and structural flexibility. However, mechanical deformation&#8208;induced cracks at the buried interface and delamination from the substrate severely constrain the optoelectronic performance and device lifespan. Here, we design a two&#8208;site bonding strategy aiming to reinforce the mechanical stability of the SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite layer using a multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH). This approach significantly enhances the bonding at the buried interface between the electronic transport layer and perovskite layer, which is demonstrated by TPH&#8208;modified SnO2/perovskite interface remaining intact after 10,000 bending cycles. Meanwhile, TPH mitigates void formation, enhances perovskite crystallinity at the buried interface, and inhibits ion migration inside the devices. Furthermore, incorporating TPH in perovskite bulk decreases the nucleation activation energy and accelerates nucleation, leading to high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.64% and 23.61% are achieved for target flexible and rigid perovskite solar cells, respectively. The target flexible device retained 92.3% of its initial PCE after 25,000 bending cycles. This approach provides a robust solution for enhancing the mechanical durability of flexible perovskite optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Converting Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalyst to a new FeNxSey cluster catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising alternative to platinum catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however its high performance cannot be maintained for a long enough time in device. The construction of a new Fe coordination environment that is different from the square&#8208;planar Fe&#8211;N 4&#160;configuration in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is expected to break current stability limits, which however remains unexplored. Here, we report the conversion of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C to a new FeNxSey catalyst, where the Fe sites are three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) co&#8208;coordinated by N and Se atoms. The FeNxSey&#160;catalyst exhibits much better 4e&#8211;&#160;ORR activity and selectivity than the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst. Specifically, the yields of H2O2 and &#183;OH radicals on FeNxSey&#160;are only one&#8208;quarter and one&#8208;third of that on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, respectively. Therefore, the FeNxSey&#160;catalyst exhibits outstanding stability, losing only 10 mV in E1/2&#160;after 10,000 cycles, much smaller than that of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst (56 mV), representing the most stable Pt&#8208;free catalysts ever reported. Moreover, the 3D co&#8208;coordination structure&#160;inhibits the Fe demetallization in the presence of H2O2. As a result, the FeNxSey&#160;based PEMFC shows excellent durability, with the current density attenuation significantly lower than that of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C based device after accelerated durability testing.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol has attracted significant interest because ethanol offers ease of transport and substantial value in chemical synthesis. Here, we present a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol achieved by precisely depositing single&#8208;atom Ir species on P cluster islands situated on the In2O3 nanosheets. The Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst achieves an impressive ethanol yield of 3.33 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 914 h&#8208;1 under 1.0 MPa (H2/CO2 = 3:1) at 180 &#176;C, nearly 8 times higher than that of the unmodified Ir1/In2O3 catalyst. Additionally, at a more industrially relevant pressure of 5.0 MPa, the TOF of the Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst can reach up to 2108 h&#8208;1, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Combined in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogenation process is significantly enhanced by the Ir1&#8208;Px entities. Specifically, the Ir atom facilitates CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling, while the surrounding P island exhibits exceptional H2 dissociation ability. These three steps have been found crucial for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This discovery opens new opportunities for the regulation of the microenvironment of current catalysts by providing essential chemical functionalities that enhance intricate and complex reaction processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;functionalized&#160;Triazolate&#8208;based&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Diluted CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient CO2 capture at concentrations between 400&#8208;2000 ppm is essential for maintaining air quality in a habitable environment and advancing carbon capture technologies. This study introduces NICS&#8208;24 (National Institute of Chemistry Structures No. 24), a Zn&#8208;oxalate 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate framework with two distinct square&#8208;shaped channels, designed to enhance CO2 capture at indoor&#8208;relevant concentrations. NICS&#8208;24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7 mmol/g at 2 mbar and 25 &#176;C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn&#8208;oxalate 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate &#8208; CALF&#8208;20 (0.17 mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino&#8208;functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS&#8208;24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85 % reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real&#8208;world conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;enhanced Ion Recognition of Triazine Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise and rapid extraction of lithium from salt&#8208;lake brines is critical to meeting the global demand for lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design ion&#8208;transport membranes with accurate recognition and fast transport path for the target ion. Here, we report a triazine covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with high resolution for Li+ and Mg2+ that enables fast Li+ transport while almost completely inhibiting Mg2+ permeation. The remarkably high rejection of Mg2+ by the COF membrane is achieved via imposed ion dehydration and the construction of the energy well. The proper hydrophilic environment of the COF channel promotes the dissociation of Li+ from the negatively charged functional groups, allowing Li+ for hopping transport supported by the sulfonate side&#8208;chains to shorten the diffusion path of Li+. Under high&#8208;salinity electrodialysis conditions, the COF membrane demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance (No Mg2+ were detected in the collected solution), achieving efficient lithium recovery and high product purity (Li2CO3: 99.3%). This membrane design strategy enables high energy efficiency and powerful lithium extraction in the electrodialysis lithium extraction process, and can be generalized to other energy and separation related membranes.</dc:description>

The as&#8208;synthesized sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; has 11.3% (313 &#197;3) of its unit cell volume in closed pores occupied by methanol (MeOH).

         <title>Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of Pd2L4 cage leads to formation two distinct Pd4L8 species with different interlocking degree: the classical quadruply interlocked double cage and a novel triply interlocked double cage, representing a previously unreported topology for Pd4L8 complexes. The degree of interlocking and equilibrium in the double cage system can be controlled thermally and through anion exchange.







Abstract
Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd4L8 catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of D4 symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of C2h symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.

     alt="Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dimerization of Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cage leads to formation two distinct Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; species with different interlocking degree: the classical quadruply interlocked double cage and a novel triply interlocked double cage, representing a previously unreported topology for Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complexes. The degree of interlocking and equilibrium in the double cage system can be controlled thermally and through anion exchange.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern-shaped Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X-ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage-to-cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Localization Transfer Regulation in 3D COFs Enhances Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [8+4] 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were developed and applied to photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation for the first time, which expanded the scope of application of 3D COFs and provided new insight into the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts.







Abstract
In this work, a series of new crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on [8+4] construction was designed and successfully realized efficient photocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4). By regulating the hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer effect in these 3D COFs, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;H containing cobalt glyoximate active centers exhibited excellent C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 performance, with an average C2H4 yield of 1755.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure C2H2, also showed near 100&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 in 1&#8201;% C2H2 contained crude C2H4 mixtures (industry&#8208;relevant conditions), and finally obtain polymer grade C2H4. In contrast, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;BF2 only showed one fifth activity due to lack of hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer. The density functional theory (DFT), projected density of states (PDOS) and molecular dynamics &#8220;slow&#8208;growth&#8221; kinetic calculations based on precise 3D COF structures confirmed that the rapid hydrogen species transfer, enhanced water dissociation and suitable C2H2 adsorption in COFs jointly contributed efficient photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH). This work provides new opportunity towards rational design and development of crystalline photocatalysts for C2H2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of a New Class of Minor Immunosuppressive Plant Sesterterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gracilisoids, a new family of plant sesterterpenoids with highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons (named neo&#8208;eurysolanes), were discovered from Eurysolen gracilis. The collective total synthesis of nine gracilisoid members has been accomplished by employing a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization and late&#8208;stage photo&#8208;oxidation as key steps. Immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was also found.







Abstract
Plant sesterterpenoids are an extremely rare family of natural products that generally possess novel chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented group of minor plant sesterterpenoids, gracilisoids B&#8722;E (2&#8211;5), which feature two types of highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons, along with their biogenetically related precursor gracilisoid A (1), from a Lamiaceae ethnomedicinal plant, Eurysolen gracilis. To confirm their structures and obtain adequate materials for biological research, the asymmetric total syntheses of gracilisoids A&#8722;E (1&#8211;5) and four new biogenetically&#8208;related congeners gracilisoids F&#8722;I (6&#8211;9) were achieved from commercially available (&#8722;)&#8208;citronellal by a bioinspired approach that involves a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization/&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone rearrangement tandem reaction and a late&#8208;stage biomimetic photooxidation as key steps. Biological investigations revealed that gracilisoids A&#8722;I (1&#8211;9) significantly inhibited IFN&#8208;&#947; production and/or T cell proliferation probably through inhibition of the STAT pathway. The findings herald the potential of these gracilisoids as novel immunosuppressive agents, and efficient synthetic approaches will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of their value in future drug development.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Guanylation Reaction for Removing MACl Residual and In&#8208;Situ Forming 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) was added into perovskite precursor to solve the issues of methylammonium chloride (MACl) residual and in situ form two&#8208;dimensional perovskite by guanylation reaction between MCH and MACl, thus yielding high quality three&#8208;dimensional perovskite. The MCH&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells realized a 26.81&#8201;%&#8208;efficiency (certified 26.02&#8201;%) with excellent device stability.







Abstract
The thermodynamical deprotonation of methylammonium chloride (MACl) has several detrimental influences on the quality of formamidinium (FA+)&#8208;based perovskite, which limits both efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, a new additive strategy was developed by introducing methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) into perovskite precursor, where guanylation reaction occurred between MCH and MACl to form a new intermediate of methyl&#8208;substituted guanidine (MSG). MSG could then bond with undercoordinated Pb2+ to in situ form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite, which would promote the growth and crystallization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite with higher crystallinity, lower defect&#8208;states density and superior stability. Finally, the MCH&#8208;treated IPSC with a small area (0.09&#8197;cm2) achieved an impressive power conversation efficiency (PCE) of 26.81&#8201;% (certified as 26.02&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs reported to date. The large area MCH&#8208;treated device (1.00&#8197;cm2) also obtained a high PCE of 24.36&#8201;%. Moreover, the unencapsulated and MCH&#8208;treated device exhibited excellent operational stability, maintaining 91.95&#8201;% and 97.06&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after aging in air and a nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h. The encapsulated MCH&#8208;treated devices retained 94.25&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point for 1200&#8197;h in air.

         <title>Boosting One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence of Interpenetrated Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (TPE&#8208;MOFs) by Linker Installation</title>

The optimization of one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence through linker installation in an interpenetrated TPE&#8208;MOF. Both the crystal packing density and ligand conformations can be modulated by linker installation.







Abstract
Immobilizing organic chromophores within the rigid framework of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) augments fluorescence by effectively curtailing molecular motions. Yet, the substantial interspaces and free volumes inherent to MOFs can undermine photoluminescence efficiency, as they partially constrain intramolecular dynamics. In this study, we achieved optimization of both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence by incorporating linkers into an interpenetrated tetraphenylethene&#8208;based MOF (TPE&#8208;MOF). This linker installation strategy enables fine&#8208;tuning of both crystal packing density and ligand conformations. Strikingly, the desolvated MOFs exhibit remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections, reaching an impressive 8801&#8197;GM. Consequently, these materials demonstrate exceptional performance in one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited cellular imaging of HepG2 cells. Our work introduces an innovative approach to enhancing two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and broadens the scope of research into one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (1/2 PEF).

     alt="Boosting One- and Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence of Interpenetrated Tetraphenylethene-Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (TPE-MOFs) by Linker Installation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimization of one/two-photon excited fluorescence through linker installation in an interpenetrated TPE-MOF. Both the crystal packing density and ligand conformations can be modulated by linker installation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immobilizing organic chromophores within the rigid framework of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) augments fluorescence by effectively curtailing molecular motions. Yet, the substantial interspaces and free volumes inherent to MOFs can undermine photoluminescence efficiency, as they partially constrain intramolecular dynamics. In this study, we achieved optimization of both one- and two-photon excited fluorescence by incorporating linkers into an interpenetrated tetraphenylethene-based MOF (TPE-MOF). This linker installation strategy enables fine-tuning of both crystal packing density and ligand conformations. Strikingly, the desolvated MOFs exhibit remarkable two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections, reaching an impressive 8801&#8197;GM. Consequently, these materials demonstrate exceptional performance in one- and two-photon excited cellular imaging of HepG2 cells. Our work introduces an innovative approach to enhancing two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and broadens the scope of research into one- and two-photon excited fluorescence (1/2 PEF).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A photosynthesis&#8208;derived bionic system for sustainable biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process, a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module was proposed for supply of NADPH and ATP in cell factory. The proposed new strategy enables facilitating both CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing and opens the possibility of manufacturing industry revolution driven by sustainable solar energy.







Abstract
&#8220;Cell factory&#8221; strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide /nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H and adenosine triphosphate ATP. However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NAD(P)H and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic disorder. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NAD(P)H and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light&#8208;driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NAD(P)H and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light&#8208;driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission mitigation and high&#8208;value chemical biomanufacturing.

         <title>Interstitial Doping in Ultrafine Nanocrystals for Efficient and Durable Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy is proposed for preparing heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon. The interstitial C and N atoms regulate the electronic structure of metal sites to promote the adsorption/dissociation process of HER intermediates, and accelerate the formation of high OER activity hydroxyl oxides on the surface.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre&#8208;deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9&#8197;nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption&#8208;dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62&#8197;mV and 237&#8197;mV for the HER and OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <title>Vesicle&#8208;Encapsulated Chemosensing Ensembles Allow Monitoring of Transmembrane Uptake Coupled with Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have encapsulated a host&#8211;guest reporter pair together with three enzymes within vesicles to monitor a two&#8208;compartment cascade reaction which includes transmembrane transport of peptide substrates and their subsequent enzymatic conversion inside the vesicles. Our &#8220;protocell&#8221; system mimics a simplistic cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism cycle. To reflect the various mechanisms of nutrient uptake by cells, we studied the uptake of different analytes by means of pore&#8208;forming proteins, amphiphilic transmembrane carriers, and direct bilayer permeation.







Abstract
Compartmentalized models with coupled catalytic networks are considered as &#8220;protocells&#8221; in the context of research related to the origin of life. To model the kinetics of a simple cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism process, we use a compartmentalized protocell system that combines liposome&#8208;encapsulated intravesicular reporter pairs with co&#8208;encapsulated enzymes to monitor the membrane transport of a substrate (analyte uptake) and its subsequent enzymatic reaction inside the vesicles (metabolism to the product). The intravesicular chemosensing ensembles consist of the macrocycles cucurbit[7]uril or p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene and matching fluorescent dyes to set up suitable reporter pairs. When these macrocycle/dye reporter pairs are co&#8208;encapsulated with enzymes (trypsin, protein kinase A, or butyrylcholinesterase), it is possible to monitor first the transport of different substrates (polylysine, protamine, H&#8208;LRRWSLG&#8208;OH, or butyrylcholine) through added pores (outer membrane proteins F and C), with synthetic carriers (amphiphilic calixarenes), or by direct permeation (only for butyrylcholine). The subsequent enzymatic conversions of the substrates after they have entered the corresponding protocells can be monitored as consecutive reactions. The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Imines and Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes is reported for the first time. Tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted chiral allylamines were synthesized in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies show that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst drives oxidative cyclization. Zinc acts as an electron source and a transmetallating agent for catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Chiral allylamines are important structural components in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes to synthesize chiral allylamines. The reaction is catalyzed by a cobalt complex derived from commercially available bisphosphine ligand utilizing zinc as the electron donor. The substrate scope is extensive. Symmetric and unsymmetric alkyl and aryl alkynes have been successfully coupled with various imines derived from aryl and alkyl aldehydes. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl amines were isolated in high yields, with enantiomeric excess surpassing &gt;99.9&#8201;% and regioselectivities exceeding &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1. These chiral allyl amines can serve as versatile platforms for subsequent transformations while preserving their stereochemical integrity. Extensive experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism. These investigations have indicated that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst enables the oxidative cyclization of alkynes and imines, and a spin crossover occurs during the enantio&#8208;determining step. Zinc plays a pivotal role in facilitating the transmetallation of the resulting azacobaltacycle. The observed enantioselectivity was interpreted by the stabilization of the transition state through higher stabilizing interaction energy from high negative polarization, dispersion, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

This work presents a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. This system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
Optogenetic systems using photosensitive proteins and chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) approaches enabled by chemical dimerizers (also termed molecular glues), are powerful tools to elucidate the dynamics of biological systems and to dissect complex biological regulatory networks. Here, we report a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular, photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that can undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally design the sMGs and further expand their scope by incorporating different photoswitches, resulting in sMGs with customizable properties. We demonstrate that this system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision. This system enables sophisticated optical manipulation of cellular processes and thus opens up a new avenue for chemo&#8208;optogenetics.

         <title>Retrieving the Stability and Practical Performance of Activation&#8208;Unstable Mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Calibrating Acidity Sensing</title>

Stabilize and improve! Mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker&#8208;installation both retrieved the activation&#8208;unstable framework of mesoporous NKM&#8208;809 and produced stabilized MOF derivatives. They established enhanced pyridyl&#8208;site density and mass transfer, and capable in self&#8208;calibrating pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Extra quenching of emission&#8208;noise further distinguished NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, integrating quality&#8208;self&#8208;monitoring for practical usage.







Abstract
The practical applications of activation&#8208;unstable mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often constrained by their structural instability. However, enhancing their stability could unlock valuable functionalities. Herein, we stabilized the otherwise unstable, post&#8208;activated structure of a novel mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF, NKM&#8208;809, which constructed from a pyridine&#8208;containing amphiprotic linker (PPTB). We applied two strategies: mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker installation. In the mixed&#8208;linker approach, we incorporated an auxiliary linker, TPTB, which resembles PPTB, during synthesis to improve the framework's stability. In the linker installation approach, we introduced a ditopic carboxylate linker (BPDC) into the coordination&#8208;unsaturated sites of NKM&#8208;809. These strategies produced stabilized derivatives, named NKM&#8208;808.X (X=&#967;PPTB) and NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, which exhibit pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence at distinct emission wavelengths. Remarkably, these emissions shift oppositely upon protonation and dissociation, distinguishing them as highly sensitive, self&#8208;calibrating acidity sensors. In NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, an additional quenching of the linker&#8208;emission (419&#8197;nm) minimizes inherent interference, enabling integrated quality and lifespan self&#8208;monitoring. Theoretical calculations identified transitions between (n, &#960;*) and (&#960;, &#960;*) emission states during the sensing process and highlighted the role of a stable mesoporous network in achieving stronger protonation response. These findings showcase the potential of stabilized mesoporous MOFs for practical applications, alongside valuable insights into strategies for optimizing such materials.

         <title>Accurate Molecular Sensing based on a Modular and Customizable CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we establish a universal nanopore sensing strategy named CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes of distinctive nanopore signals. The detection thus can be easily customized into various application scenes with all advantages of high accuracy, high resolution, high simplicity and multi&#8208;assay available.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanopore is a promising single molecular detection technique, but is largely limited by relatively low resolution to small&#8208;size targets and laborious design of signaling probes. Here we establish a universal, CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes via a &#8220;Signal&#8208;ON&#8221; mode. Target recognition activates the cleavage activity of a Cas12a/crRNA system and then completely digest the blocker of an initiator. The unblocked initiator then triggers downstream DNA assembly reaction and generate a large&#8208;size structure easy for nanopore detection. Such integration of Cas12a/crRNA with DNA assembly establishes an accurate correspondence among the input targets, output DNA structures, and the ultimate nanopore signals. We demonstrated dsDNA, long RNA (i.e., Flu virus gene), short microRNA (i.e., let&#8208;7d) and non&#8208;nucleic acids (i.e., Pb2+) as input paradigms. Various structural assembly reactions, such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR), G&#8208;HCR and duplex polymerization strategy (DPS), are adapted as outputs for nanopore signaling. Simultaneous assay is also verified via transferring FluA and FluB genes into HCR and G&#8208;HCR, respectively. CANON is thus a modular sensing platform holding multiple advantages such as high accuracy, high resolution and high universality, which can be easily customized into various application scenes.

         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;stabilized rhodium borylene, generated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperative dehydrogenation of H2BMes (Mes=mesityl), regioselectively adds a series of alkynes (R=Ph, Me, H, CO2Et) across boron and the carbon atom of a CO ligand.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Framework as a Highly Porous Photosensitizer for Environmental Remediation and Pollutants Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with hbc topology. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications ranging from dual&#8208;mode fluorescence sensing to pollutants removal from aqueous solutions and detoxification of a mustard gas simulant via photosensitization.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF, which crystallizes in AA&#8208;stacking mode with hcb topology.

&lt;p&gt;Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework &lt;b&gt;BDP-TFP-COF&lt;/b&gt; which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with &lt;b&gt;hbc&lt;/b&gt; topology.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Organonitrogen Compounds via Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated cascade reaction combines the electrochemical synthesis of hydroxylamine and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient pathway. The system alleviates the environmental crisis caused by the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle and reduces the waste of resources in the transport and purification process.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is a key intermediate in the formation of numerous high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds. The traditional synthesis of NH2OH requires the use of precious metals under high temperature conditions, which leads to high cost, high energy consumption, and environmental pollution. The NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction integrates the electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient alternative. This review presents the recent advances on electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds by NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. We present key concepts and the transformation process of different N&#8208;species to NH2OH, discuss suitable substrates and electrocatalysts, and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in generating compounds such as amino acids, cyclohexanone oxime, urea, amine, etc.. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in this emerging field to encourage further research effort and the development of NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Preparation of High&#8208;Crystalline Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy is developed to achieve rapid and kilogram&#8208;scale preparation of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. The obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and micropollutant removal efficiency as well as superior solution processability.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has been extensively applied to the preparation of various porous organic polymers because of its simple operation and abundant building blocks. However, due to its poor reversibility and excessive random reactive sites, the synthesis of crystalline organic polymers/frameworks by Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has never been realized so far. Herein, we develop a molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy to achieve rapid preparation (within only 30 minutes) of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. Theoretical calculations and detailed experiments revealed the critical role of carboxyl groups in aromatic benzene monomer during the CTFs crystallization, which can not only effectively cause a suitable activation barrier for the electrophilic attack of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine through their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, but also introduce anchoring effects (molecular confinement effects) to facilitate the ordered polymerization at specific sites in 2D planar direction. Benefiting from the convenient synthetic route and low&#8208;cost raw materials, we could unprecedentedly realize the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized high&#8208;crystalline CTFs. Moreover, thanks to the hydrophilic and ionizable properties of carboxyl groups, the obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and superior solution processability.

         <title>Mastering the Copolymerization Behavior of Ethyl Cyanoacrylate as Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;metal Battery Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a facile approach to achieve efficient and controllable copolymerization behaviour of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, affording mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolytes for high voltage and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano&#8208;containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual&#8208;lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high&#8208;ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA&#8208;based copolymers. The mechanically robust polymer network made by the ECA copolymer enables LMBs with both LFP cathodes and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes (4.5&#8197;V) operatable at different temperatures with ultra&#8208;long cycle life at 1&#8197;C (capacity retention of 81.1&#8201;% and 83.8&#8201;%, respectively, over 1000 cycles).

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Opening Control Strategy via Nitrate&#8211;Chloride Anion Exchange for Enhanced Hydrogen Isotope Separation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;opening control via anion exchange in JCM&#8208;1 enables enhanced hydrogen isotope separation through precise tuning of pore aperture and diffusion barriers. The dynamic interplay between structural flexibility and adsorption energetics maximizes D2/H2 selectivity, establishing a robust platform for cryogenic gas separation applications.







Abstract
Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes, especially deuterium (D2), is pivotal for advancing industries such as nuclear fusion, semiconductor processing, and metabolic imaging. Current technologies, including cryogenic distillation and Girdler sulfide processes, suffer from significant limitations in selectivity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we introduce a novel approach utilizing an imidazolium&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), JCM&#8208;1, designed to enhance D2/H2 separation through temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;opening controlled by ion exchange. By substituting NO3&#8722; ions in JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) with Cl&#8722; ions to form JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;), we precisely modulate the gate&#8208;opening threshold, achieving a significant enhancement in isotope selectivity. JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) exhibited a D2/H2 selectivity (SD2/H2) of 14.4 at 30&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, while JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50&#8197;K and 1&#8197;mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate&#8208;opening temperature resulting from the Cl&#8722; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D2. Our findings reveal that JCM&#8208;1 frameworks, with their finely tunable gate&#8208;opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion&#8208;exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibited a D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (S&lt;sub&gt;D2/H2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 14.4 at 30&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, while JCM-1(Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50&#8197;K and 1&#8197;mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate-opening temperature resulting from the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings reveal that JCM-1 frameworks, with their finely tunable gate-opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion-exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regularly Arranged Heterogeneous Pores in Gas Separation Membranes Constructed by Cocrystallization of Porous Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating heterogeneous pore membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. The co&#8208;crystal membranes, featuring alternating small pore&#8208;large pore structure, exhibited good H2/CO2 gas separation performance by overcoming the selectivity&#8208;permeability trade&#8208;off.







Abstract
Integrating two or more materials to construct membranes with heterogeneous pore structures is an effective strategy for enhancing separation performance. Regularly arranging these heterogeneous pores can significantly optimize the combined effect of the introduced components. Porous Organic Cages (POCs), an emerging subclass of porous materials composed of discrete molecules, assemble to form interconnected pores and exhibit permanent porosity in the solid state. A unique feature of POCs is their modularity, enabling a &#8220;mix and match&#8221; approach to create co&#8208;crystal structures driven by the intermolecular interactions. Herein, we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating gas separation membranes. We prepared membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. By optimizing the cocrystalization conditions, we successfully fabricated continuous, defect&#8208;free gas membranes, benefiting from chiral recognition interactions. By introducing regularly alternating small and large pores, we addressed challenges such as the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in gas separation membrane. Moreover, the cocrystallization strategy has been proven effective for other molecular systems besides POCs, such as macrocycles, for the preparation of co&#8208;crystal membranes. This method broadens the scope for fabricating high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes with ordered heterogeneous pores.

         <title>A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Radical Emission System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems have been built by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. The ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer and ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer effects between metal compounds and organic radicals endow these systems&#8217; multi&#8208;band and multiple stimulus&#8208;response emissions. In addition, such materials have been used to detect radioactive metal ions.







Abstract
Developing new organic radical emission systems and regulating their luminescence properties presents a significant challenge. Herein, we build dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. After the assembling, dual&#8208;band, and excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission was observed upon ultraviolet light irradiation, one emission band originates from carbonyl radical after light irradiation, the other band from the ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which benefits from the charge transfer from the radicals to the metal salts. The dual emission centers also introduce excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties for the molecules. In addition, three&#8208;band emission covering the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions can be shown when two or three kinds of metal ions are simultaneously doped into the radical system driven by the ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Interestingly, visible light can quickly quench the radical emission of systems, thus realizing a dynamic luminescence. The LMMCT effect and strong supramolecular interactions significantly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by up to 67.2&#8201;%. Moreover, such materials can be successfully used for detecting radioactive metal ions and information encryption. This study develops a platform for manufacturing various metal&#8208;organic radical emission systems with diverse properties.

         <title>Phosphorescent Liquid Crystalline Polymer&#8208;based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides for Enhanced Photonic Signal Processing and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized phosphorescent optical waveguides with high efficiency have been designed and synthesized using liquid crystalline polymers. These waveguides exhibit low optical loss and emit circularly polarized phosphorescence, making them promising candidates for applications in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguides have significant potential for advancing photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the development of CPL optical waveguides materials (OWMs) with low optical loss coefficient remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this, we design and synthesize CPL OWMs based on room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Experimental results demonstrate that these LCPs exhibit a nematic liquid crystal phase and a phosphorescence lifetime of approximately 0.145&#8197;ms. By introducing a chiral dopant, we induce a chiral arrangement in the LCPs, followed by crosslinking via photo&#8208;cycloaddition and removal of the chiral dopants through solvent soaking. The resulting polymers exhibit stable solvent resistance and highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) properties, with dissymmetric factors (gRTP) in the range of 0.16 to 0.17. Notably, the CPP&#8208;active OWMs exhibit efficient circularly polarized photonic signal waveguiding, with an optical loss coefficient of approximately 0.175 dB/mm. Ultimately, these CPP&#8208;active OWMs are sucessfully applied in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching, paving the way for advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Accessing Azetidines through Magnesium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Group Transfer from Iminoiodinane to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a magnesium&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. This protocol operates under mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and showcases excellent chemoselectivity, along with broad functional group tolerance. We report for the first time that challenging alkyl donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes can undergo ring expansion leading to aliphatic azetidines without relying on external oxidants or precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium (Mg)&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.

         <title>Exploiting Lattice Carbon&#8208;Induced Modulation Effect in Nickel towards Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the content of lattice carbon (LC), the electronic structure and adsorption properties of nickel are changed, and the volcanic relationship between the lattice carbon content and the alkaline HOR activity is revealed.







Abstract
Doping with non&#8208;metallic heteroatom is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structure of Ni for enhancing its alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalytic performance. However, the modulation of HOR activity of Ni by lattice carbon (LC) atoms has rarely been reported, especially to reveal the rule between the doping effect and activity caused by the content of LC atoms. Here, hydrogen is proposed as a scavenger for LC atoms in the pyrolytic reduction process to finely control the content of LC atoms in Ni. With the removal of LC atoms in Ni lattice, the electronic structure changes from Ni3C&#8208;like electronic structure to quasi&#8208;Ni structure. Furthermore, a volcanic relationship between the LC content and HOR activity of Ni is established for the first time. The Cless&#8208;Ni (LC0.44&#8208;Ni) with optimized LC content shows the best activity owing to the weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and optimal hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE). This work provides an inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts by tailoring the electronic structure of the metal via LC atoms doping.

With the removal of LC atoms in Ni lattice, the electronic structure changes from Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C-like electronic structure to quasi-Ni structure. Furthermore, a volcanic relationship between the LC content and HOR activity of Ni is established for the first time. The C&lt;sub&gt;less&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni (LC&lt;sub&gt;0.44&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni) with optimized LC content shows the best activity owing to the weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and optimal hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE). This work provides an inspiration for the design of high-performance catalysts by tailoring the electronic structure of the metal via LC atoms doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Symmetry Copper Benzenehexathiol Coordination Polymer with In&#8208;Plane Electrical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrically conductive coordination polymer, Cu5BHT, featuring a low&#8208;symmetry structure, is synthesized on the water surface. We demonstrate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal directions.







Abstract
Electrically conductive coordination polymers (ECCPs), particularly those incorporating benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligands, are emerging as a distinctive class of electronic materials with tunable semiconducting and metallic properties. However, the exploration of novel ECCPs with low&#8208;symmetry structures and electrical anisotropy remains under development. Here, we report the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of a novel ECCP, namely Cu5BHT, which exhibits a low&#8208;symmetry structure and unique in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy that differs from the well&#8208;known Cu3BHT phase. Utilizing imaging and diffraction techniques, we elucidate the unit cell and crystal structure of Cu5BHT, revealing an asymmetric arrangement of the kagome resembling lattice connected by two different secondary building units: square planar CuS4 and non&#8208;planar Cu2S4. Theoretical studies indicate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal direction. Single&#8208;crystal electrical measurements confirm a metallic character characterized by the increase of conductance upon cooling. Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the ab plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low&#8208;symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy.

         <title>Design of an Ultrafast and Controlled Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter RAFT Polymerization for Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel xanthate molecule was designed to facilitate highly controlled photoiniferter RAFT polymerization at fast rates under visible light. This approach was applied in aqueous photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (photo&#8208;PISA). The rapid photolysis and extended absorption of this xanthate enable ultrafast and scalable fabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with various well&#8208;defined morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.







Abstract
In this contribution, we designed a new xanthate RAFT agent by introducing (5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxy (TNO) as the Z group, namely 2&#8208;[(((5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxycarbonothioyl)thio)ethyl propanoate] (TNXEP). Due to the presence of the TNO group, TNXEP enabled highly controlled and ultrafast photoiniferter RAFT polymerization under violet (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) and blue (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) light. This approach was effectively extended to aqueous media for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), facilitating the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles. Leveraging the rapid photolysis and extended absorption of TNXEP, we demonstrated the first photoiniferter PISA system realizing ultrafast polymerization (&gt;90&#8201;% monomer conversion in minutes) under visible light irradiation. Enhanced visible light penetration improved photopolymerization uniformity, enabling rapid and scalable production of polymeric nanoparticles at a 30&#8197;g scale in just 10 minutes, with tunable morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.

         <title>Comprehensive Passivation of Surface and Bulk Defects in Perovskite for High Efficiency Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive strategy combining &#8220;wet film treatment&#8221; and &#8220;dry film treatment&#8221; was proposed to passivate surface and bulk defects of CsPbI3 films. The high diffusivity of choline in the intermediate phase film made the LD perovskite permeate through the grain boundaries of the bulk film. Benefiting from this strategy, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have the advantages of high stability and low cost, but their mean efficiency has become an obstacle to commercialization. Defects, which are widely distributed on the surface and bulk of films, are an important factor in C&#8208;PSCs for low efficiency. The conventional post&#8208;treatment method through forming a low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskite layer usually fails in manipulating the bulk defects. Herein, we propose a strategy of combining wet film (uncrystallized) treatment with dry film treatment to in situ form LD perovskite throughout the grain boundaries inside of the film and on the surface of the film, thereby simultaneously passivating the bulk and surface defects in the CsPbI3 film. As a result, the photoluminescence lifetime is significantly improved from 22.5&#8197;ns to 92.1&#8197;ns. The assembled CsPbI3 C&#8208;PSCs based on the above strategy deliver a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Anion Transport by Bambusuril&#8208;Bile Acid Conjugates: Drastic Effect of the Cholesterol Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bambusuril macrocycles were functionalized with bile acids of different polarities and studied as anion transporters. The bambusuril with the most polar bile acids was demonstrated to form a unimolecular anion channel. Furthermore, increasing the cholesterol content in the membrane of liposomes drastically decreased the ion transport activity, likely squeezing the bile acid arms together to close the channel.







Abstract
Artificial anion transporters offer a potential way to treat deficiencies in cellular anion transport of genetic origins. In contrast to the large variety of mobile anion carriers and self&#8208;assembled anion channels reported, unimolecular anion channels are less investigated. Herein, we present a unique example of a unimolecular anion channel based on a bambusuril (BU) macrocycle, a well&#8208;established anion receptor. The BU structure was expanded by appending various bile acid residues allowing a single molecule to span the membrane. Chloride transport mediated by BUs through lipid bilayers was investigated in liposomes and these studies revealed a surprisingly high dependence of the anion transport activity on the cholesterol content in the liposomal membrane.

         <title>Iridium(III) Blue Phosphors with Heteroleptic Carbene Cyclometalates: Isomerization, Emission Tuning, and OLED Fabrications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ir(III) complexes are particularly noted for their excellent photophysical properties in giving blue OLED phosphors. In this study, two distinctive carbene pro&#8208;chelates LAH2+ and LBH2+ (or LCH2+) were employed in preparation of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, to which LAH2+ bears a cyano substituted benzoimidazolium along with N&#8208;mesityl appendage, while LBH2+ (or LCH2+) carries the symmetrical benzoimidazolium entity. Notably, the reversible equilibration at high temperature was observed for m, f&#8208;ct14 and m, f&#8208;ct15 with a single LA chelate. In contrast, only the mer&#8208;substituted m&#8208;ct16 was obtained upon employing two LA chelates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ir(III) complexes are particularly noted for their excellent photophysical properties in giving blue OLED phosphors. In this study, two distinctive carbene pro-chelates LAH2+ and LBH2+ (or LCH2+) were employed in preparation of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, to which LAH2+ bears a cyano substituted benzoimidazolium along with N-mesityl appendage, while LBH2+ (or LCH2+) carries the symmetrical benzoimidazolium entity. Notably, the reversible equilibration at high temperature was observed for m, f-ct14 and m, f-ct15 with a single LA chelate. In contrast, only the mer-substituted m-ct16 was obtained upon employing two LA chelates. All Ir(III) complexes exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#934;PL &#8805; 78%) with short radiative lifetimes (&#964;rad &#8804; 1.05 &#181;s) in solution. The Ph OLED device with m-ct16 afforded an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% at 5000 cd m&#8210;2. Moreover, the hyper-OLED based on m-ct16 and v-DABNA exhibited EQE1000 of 32.1% (EQE recorded at 1000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2) and J90 of 15.0 mA cm&#8210;2 (current density at 90% of max. EQE).

         <title>Controlled Introduction of sp3&#160;Quantum Defects in Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over low&#8208;dimensional materials holds an immense potential for their applications in sensing, imaging and information processing. The controlled introduction of sp3 quantum defects (color centers) can be used to tailor the optoelectronic properties of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the tissue transparency (&gt;&#160;800&#160;nm) and the telecommunication window. However, an uncontrolled functionalization of SWCNTs with defects leads to a loss of the NIR fluorescence. Here, we use mechanochemistry with aryldiazonium salts to create quantum defects in SWCNTs. The reaction proceeds within 5&#160;min without solvents or illumination and can be controlled by a varied mechanochemical energy impact. By working in the solid&#8208;state, this method presents an alternative synthetic route and marks a crucial step for tailoring photophysics of SWCNTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Tuned Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Synergistic Covalent Adaptable Networks: Towards Recycled Elastomers with Excellent Creep&#8208;Resistant Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer innovative solutions for the reprocessing and recycling of thermoset polymers. However, achieving a balance between easy reprocessing and creep resistance remains a challenge. This study focuses on designing and synthesizing polyurethane (PU) materials with tailored properties by manipulating the stereochemistry of diamine chain extenders. By employing cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;configurations of diamine extenders, we developed a series of PU materials with varying mechanical properties and creep resistance. The trans&#8208;configured materials (R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU or S,S&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited superior creep resistance and mechanical strength due to dense hydrogen bonding networks. The cis&#8208;configured materials (Cis&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited enhanced processability and elasticity. Under 0.1 MPa stress, R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU showed a mere 3.5% strain change at 170 &#176;C over 60 minutes, highlighting its superior creep resistance. Both configurations can be recycled via urea bond exchange reactions using hot pressing or solvothermal methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the (R,R&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)&#8322; and (S,S&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)&#8322; segments form six hydrogen bonds with shorter bond lengths, leading to stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Conversely, the (Cis&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)&#8322; segment forms four hydrogen bonds with longer bond lengths, resulting in weaker interactions. This work highlights the critical role of stereochemistry in designing high&#8208;performance, recyclable polymer materials with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Unprecedent Layered Perovskite&#8208;type Heterostructure Ferroelectric via Chemical Molecular Scissor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise stacking of distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rigid slabs to build heterostructures has renewed the portfolio of 2D materials, e.g., magic&#8208;angle graphene, due to the emergence of exotic physical properties. Recently, single&#8208;crystal heterostructures of layered perovskites have emerged as an exciting branch, while it remains scarce to achieve strong ferroelectricity in this new heterostructure family. Here, we present the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal, (EA3Pb2Br7)EA4Pb3Br10 (1, EA = ethylamine), by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. It has notable ferroelectricity of large spontaneous polarization (Ps ~ 5.0 &#956;C/cm&#178;) and high Curie temperature (Tc ~ 375 K). Structurally, its inorganic framework adopts a unique 2D heterostructure that contains two different rigid slabs of {EA3Pb2Br7}n and {EA4Pb3Br10}n. This motif is self&#8208;assembled by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer clipping of rigid prototype sheets, using extra neopentylamine as a molecular chemical scissor. Unlike epitaxial growth, such a molecule&#8208;level stacking facilitates the growth of heterostructure single crystals. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device of 1 exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode, being the highest level of 2D perovskite ferroelectric family. Our work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Germanium Iodide Perovskite Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of ferroelectricity in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors has opened a new and exciting chapter in next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics due to their lattice&#8208;dimensionality&#8208;induced unique behaviors and fascinating functionalities brought by spontaneous polarization. The emerging layered halide perovskites with 2D lattices provide a great platform for generating reduced symmetry and low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectricity. Herein, inspired by the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality, a series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors A2CsGe2I7 [where A = PA (propylammonium), BA (butylammonium) and AA (amylammonium)] was firstly developed, which demonstrates remarkable semiconducting features including narrow direct bandgap (~1.8 eV) and high conductivity over 32.23 nS/cm. Emphatically, these layered germanium iodide perovskites manifest large in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization over ~10.0 &#956;C/cm2, mainly attributed to the large off&#8208;centering ion displacement induced by stereo&#8208;active lone&#8208;pairs of Ge2+ . More specifically, in contrast to three&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric CsGeI3, the representative 2D layered BA2CsGe2I7 manifests a superior polarization&#8208;sensitive bulk photovoltaic effect with a polarization ratio of 1.68 and high short circuit current density up to 81.25 &#956;A/cm2, superior to those of reported layered halide perovskite ferroelectrics. This work provides an exciting pathway for the development of 2D ferroelectric semiconductorsand sheds light on their further applications in photoelectronic fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Hydrogen Bonding between Ligand and Substrate Accelerates C&#8211;H Bond Activation and Enables Switchable Site Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed selective and efficient activation of an inert C&#8211;H bond in an organic substrate is of importance for the development of streamlined synthetic methodologies. An attractive approach is the design of a metal catalyst capable of recognizing an organic substrate through noncovalent interactions to control reactivity and selectivity. We report here a spirobipyridine ligand that bears a hydroxy group that recognizes pyridine and quinoline substrates through hydrogen bonding, and in combination with an iridium catalyst enables site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H borylation. The site selectivity can be switched by simply changing the position of the hydroxy group on the ligand. The catalyst also accelerates the reactions, overrides steric bias, and selectively recognizes a pyridine substrate in the presence of other hydrogen bond acceptors. These features are reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis and suggest that judicious design of the recognition group on the ligand can become a general strategy to selectively and efficiently functionalize organic substrates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer a vibrant, eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional toxic pigments and dyes, providing vivid structural colors with significantly reduced environmental impact. Scaling up the synthesis of these polymers for practical applications has been challenging with conventional batch methods, which suffer from slow mass and heat transfer, inadequate mixing, and issues with reproducibility. Precise control over molecular weight and dispersity remains a significant challenge for achieving finely tuned color appearances. Here, we present an alternative strategy to overcome the challenges by integrating a rapid continuous flow technique with an in&#8208;line self&#8208;assembly procedure. This strategy enables the rapid, stable and large&#8208;scale synthesis of narrow&#8208;dispersed BBCPs, exceeding 2 kg/day, a significant improvement over conventional gram&#8208;scale methods. Furthermore, precise control over the degree of polymerization is achieved with an unprecedented interval accuracy of four repeat units. This level of precision enables refined color calibration in the resulting photonic pigments, effectively eliminating the need for labor&#8208;intensive and costly multiple batch syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Switching of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation for Orchestrating Enzyme Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and associated assembly and disassembly of biomolecular condensates play crucial roles in cellular organization and metabolic networks. These processes are often regulated by supramolecular interactions. However, the complex and disordered structures of IDPs, coupled with their rapid conformational fluctuations, pose significant challenges for reconstructing supramolecularly&#8208;regulated dynamic LLPS systems and quantitatively illustrating variations in molecular interactions. Inspired by the structural feature of IDPs that facilitates LLPS, we designed a simplified phase&#8208;separating molecule, Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap, consisting of two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative. This compound exhibits LLPS under physiological conditions, forming coacervate microdroplets that undergo multiple cycles of disassembly and reassembly upon stoichiometric addition of Cucurbit[7]uril and Adamantane, respectively, based upon competitive host&#8208;guest interactions. Importantly, such reversible control offers a unique route to quantify entropically dominant nature (&#916;S= 14.0 cal&#8729;mol&#8208;1&#8729;K&#8208;1) within the LLPS process, in which the binding affinity of host&#8208;guest interactions (&#916;G= &#8722;14.9 kcal&#8729;mol&#8208;1) surpass that of the LLPS of Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap (&#916;G= &#8722;2.1 kcal&#8729;mol&#8208;1), enabling the supramolecular regulation process. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, provides a promising platform for either boosting or retarding enzymatic reactions, thereby orchestrating biological enzyme kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Tolerance and Phase Selection in the Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation and Electrocatalytic OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks are coordination&#8208;driven assemblies, the structural prediction and design using metal&#8208;ligand interactions can be unreliable due to other competing interactions. Leveraging non&#8208;coordination interactions to develop porous assemblies could enable new materials and applications. Here, we use a multi&#8208;module MOF system to explore important and pervasive impact of ligand&#8208;ligand interactions on metal&#8208;ligand as well as ligand&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly process. It is found that ligand&#8208;ligand interactions play critical roles on the scope or breakdown of isoreticular chemistry. With cooperative di&#8208; and tri&#8208;topic ligands, a family of Ni&#8208;MOFs has been synthesized in various structure types including partitioned MIL&#8208;88&#8208;acs (pacs), interrupted pacs (i&#8208;pacs), and UMCM&#8208;1&#8208;muo. A new type of isoreticular chemistry on the muo platform is established between two drastically different chemical systems. The gas sorption and electrocatalytic studies were performed that reveal excellent performance such as high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 21.8 and high C2H2 uptake capacity of 114.5 cm3/g at 298 K and 1 bar.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystal&#8208;Engineered Polydimethylsiloxane: Enhancing Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity through High Grafting Density of Mesogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing power and integration of electronic devices have intensified serious heat accumulation, driving the demand for higher intrinsic thermal conductivity in thermal interface materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Grafting mesogens onto PDMS can enhance its intrinsic thermal conductivity. However, the high stability of the PDMS chain limits the grafting density of mesogens, restricting the improvement in thermal conductivity. This work proposes a new strategy to efficiently introduce mesogens onto PDMS through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of liquid crystal cyclosiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, enhancing the grafting density. The relationship between the grafting density and intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane (LC&#8208;PDMS) is investigated by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Based on the simulation results, LC&#8208;PDMS with enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity is synthesized. When the grafting density of mesogens reaches 77.4%, its intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) increases to 0.56 W/(m&#183;K), showing a 180.0% improvement over ordinary PDMS (0.20 W/(m&#183;K)). The LC&#8208;PDMS also exhibits the low dielectric constant (&#949;, 2.69), low dielectric loss tangent (tan&#948;, 0.0027), high insulation performance (volume resistivity, 3.51&#215;1013 &#937;&#183;cm), excellent thermal stability (heat resistance index, 217.8&#8451;) and excellent hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 137.4&#176;), fulfilling the comprehensive requirements of advanced thermal interface materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced G&#8208;quartets: Robust Supramolecular Polymers Exhibiting Heating&#8208;Induced Aqueous Phase Transitions into Gel or Precipitate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Certain proteins and synthetic covalent polymers experience aqueous phase transitions, driving functional self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we unveil the ability of supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by G4.Cu+ to undergo heating&#8208;induced unexpected aqueous phase transitions. For the first time, guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) formed a highly stable G&#8208;quartet (G4.Cu+)/G&#8208;quadruplex as a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure with temperature tolerance, distinct from the well&#8208;known G4.K+. The G4.Cu+ self&#8208;assembled in water through p&#8208;p stacking, metallophilic and hydrophobic interactions, forming thermally robust SPs. This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger coordination of Cu+ to four carbonyl oxygens of G&#8208;quartet and the presence of Cu+&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Cu+ attractive metallophilic interactions in Cu+&#8208;induced G&#8208;quadruplex, exhibiting a significantly higher interaction energy than K+ as determined computationally. Remarkably, the aqueous SP solution exhibited heating&#8208;induced phase transitions&#8212;forming a hydrogel through dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking of SPs below cloud temperature (Tcp) and a hydrophobic collapse&#8208;induced solid precipitate above Tcp, showcasing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. Notably, this LCST behavior of G4.Cu+ SP originates from biomolecular functionality rather than commonly exploited thermo&#8208;responsive oligoethylene glycols with supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, exploiting the redox reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+, we demonstrated control over the assembly and disassembly of G&#8208;quartets/G&#8208;quadruplex and gelation reversibly.</dc:description>

         <title>Carving Metal&#8722;Organic&#8722;Framework Glass Based Solid&#8722;State Electrolyte Via a Top&#8722;Down Strategy for Lithium&#8722;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) suffer from low Li conductivity, poor kinetics and safety concerns. Here, we present a novel porous MOF glass gelled polymer electrolyte (PMG&#8208;GPE) prepared via a top&#8208;down strategy, which features a unique three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graded&#8208;aperture structure for efficient ion transport. Comprehensive analyses, including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS), Solid&#8208;state 7Li magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS&#8208;NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and electrochemical tests, quantify the pore structures, revealing their relationship with ion conductivity that increases and then decreases as macropore proportion rises. The introduced dispersed macropores (17% fraction) can serve as bridges, connecting adjacent transport units to accelerate ion transport. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths&#160;constructed by hierarchical pore structure, the PMG&#8208;GPE achieves a high ionic conductivity of 1.9 mS cm&#8722;1. Additionally, the robust mechanical properties of PMG&#8208;GPE effectively suppress dendrite growth and penetration, outperforming crystal MOF&#8208;based electrolytes. The prepared Li symmetric batteries with PMG&#8208;GPE demonstrate a high critical current density of 5.1 mA cm&#8208;2 (two times higher than crystal MOF&#8208;electrolytes) and stable cycling for over 6000 hours without short circuits. Furthermore, a Li/PMG&#8208;GPE/LFP half&#8208;cell exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 83.12% after 1400 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Dynamic Protein Clustering with AIEgen&#8208;Active Chemigenetic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein clustering/disassembling is a fundamental process in biomolecular condensates, playing&#160;crucial roles in cell fate decision and cellular homeostasis. However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral&#8208;tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an "amphiphilic" AIEgen&#160;QMSO3Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the probe&#160;achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous environment and lipophilic organelles, ensuring an ultra&#8208;low background&#8208;interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering&#8208;dependent ultra&#8208;sensitive response, with a substantial lighting&#8208;up fluorescence (67.5&#8208;fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of IRE1&#160;clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. For the first time, we have demonstrated the use of chemigenetic probe to reveal therapy&#8208;induced ER stress and screen drugs in&#160;three&#8208;dimensional scenario: microviscosity change, clustering dynamic, and cluster morphology. This chemigenetic probe design strategy would greatly facilitate the advancement of mapping protein dynamics in cell homeostasis and medicine research.</dc:description>

         <title>A Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Approach to Isotactic Alternating Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed for various biomedical applications owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. The discovery of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric alternating PLGA pairs underscored its potential as high&#8208;performance biodegradable materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability. Herein, we have established a regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach for the synthesis of stereocomplexed isoenriched alternating PLGA from racemic methyl&#8208;glycolide (rac&#8208;MG). The high sequence and tacticity control was accomplished by an optimized enantiopure scandium catalyst bearing a spiro&#8208;salen scaffold. Varying polymer stereoregularity Pm from 0.4 to 0.91 led to a transformation of the resulting alternating PLGA from amorphous to semicrystalline materials. Notably, the stereocomplexed alternating PLGA demonstrated enhanced melting transition temperature (Tm up to 191 &#176;C) and crystallization rate. This regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled polymerization represented a versatile approach for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>AA&#8208;Stacked Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) has been considered a promising electrode material&#160;for application in electrochemical energy storage. However, studies on GDY featuring an ordered interlayer stacking are lacking, which is supposed to be another effective way to increase lithium binding sites and diffusion pathways. Herein, we synthesized a hydrogen&#8208;substituted GDY (HsGDY) with a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacking structure&#160;via a facile alcohol&#8208;thermal method. &#160;Such unique architecture enables a rapid lithium transfer through the well&#8208;organized pore channels and endows a stronger adsorption capability to lithium atom as compared to the arbitrarily&#8208;stacked mode. The resultant HsGDY exhibits a reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1&#160;ranking among the most powerful GDY&#8208;based electrode materials, and an excellent rate performance&#160;as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability. The successful preparation&#160;of gram&#8208;level high&#8208;quality HsGDY products in batches implies the&#160;potential for large&#8208;scale lithium&#8208;storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Lowering Linker Symmetry to Access Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Inverse Alkane/Alkene Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enriching the structural diversity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great importance in developing functional porous materials with specific properties. New MOF structures can be accessed through the rational design of organic linkers with diverse geometric conformations, and their structural complexity can be enhanced by choosing linkers with reduced symmetry. Herein, a series of Zr&#8208;based MOFs with unprecedented topologies were developed through a linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach. A tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs (denoted as NU&#8208;57, NU&#8208;58, and NU&#8208;59) by modulating synthetic conditions. Notably, the conformational flexibility and reduced symmetry of the linker generated two unprecedented topologies in NU&#8208;58 and NU&#8208;59. Furthermore, solvent removal in NU&#8208;58 via thermal activation process produced missing linker defects. Finally, the adsorption behavior of these MOFs towards alkanes and alkenes was studied to gain insights into their structure&#8208;property relationships, which demonstrated that NU&#8208;57 and NU&#8208;58 exhibit unusual reverse selectivity for alkanes in alkane/alkene separations. Overall, this work highlights the rational design of linkers using a desymmetrization strategy as a powerful method to enrich the structural diversity of MOFs and to access novel MOFs with unique properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of Bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bryostatins are a family of marine natural products that have garnered significant interests, as evidenced by over 40 clinical trials. However, their extremely low natural abundance has severely limited further research. Despite significant efforts, which have led to the total synthesis of seven bryostatin members by eight independent research groups, these complex molecules present persistent challenges for stereocontrolled, large&#8208;scale, and especially divergent synthesis. Here, we report the divergent total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3. Notably, 1.5 g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. Key transformations include Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling to rapidly assemble the northern fragment, the flow chemistry&#8208;assisted visible light&#8208;induced alkyl radical conjugate addition to convergently construct the southern fragment, and an intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization to establish the cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3% to 4.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>COF&#8208;assisted construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels to boost activity for high&#8208;performance fuel cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional lamellar materials disperse platinum sites and minimize noble&#8208;metal usage for fuel cells, while mass transport resistance at the stacked layers spurs device failure with a significant performance decline in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Herein, we implant porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks (COF) into the graphene&#8208;based catalytic layer for the construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels, which highly facilitates the activity of oxygen reduction reactions in both the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and MEA device tests. Specifically, the normalized mass activity is remarkably boosted by 3.7 times to 1.56 A mgpt&#8208;1 after additions of suitable COF modifications in the RDE tests. Especially, an excellent maximum power density of 1.015 W cm&#8208;2 is realized on the MEA in H2/Air condition, representing a 22% improvement through such constructions of steric mass&#8208;charge channels. Meanwhile, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of fuel cells demonstrates only 0.8% reductions after 10,000 cycles of stability tests. We further extended such methodology of constructing mass&#8208;charge channels to granular PtCo and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which demonstrates a significant impetus for stimulating the catalytic activity in fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Interface Enabled by a Guest&#8208;Anionic Chemistry for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by interfacial side reactions and dendritic growth poses significant constraints on the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a co&#8208;solute, acesulfame potassium, with strongly polar, zincophilic guest anions is introduced into a conventional low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolyte. This regulation enhances the electrolyte's ionic conductivity and accelerates the desolvation process of zinc ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface.Furthermore, the introduced acesulfame anions give rise to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface with a hierarchical crystalline&#8208;amorphous bilayer structure that effectively suppresses side reactions and allows for uniform zinc ion diffusion&#8208;deposition. Results show that the zinc anode in the designed electrolyte possesses remarkable reversibility, achieving stable operation under a ultrahigh current density of 40 mA cm&#8208;2 and 67.6 % depth of discharge, surpassing most previous reports. Zn//I2 full cells assembled with this electrolyte exhibit high rate capability (135.0 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1) and remarkable lifespan (96.3% capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1). A large&#8208;sized Zn//I2 pouch cell is also demonstrated, delivering a total capacity of 170 mAh with 78.8% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 3.3 mA cm&#8208;2, highlighting the potential of the guest&#8208;anionic chemistry in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Hydrogen Production Coupled with Glucose Valorization through Modulating Au&#8208;Pt Coordination on Ultrathin Au3Pt Twin Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organics electrooxidation coupled hydrogen production has attracted increasing attention due to the low operation voltage. Nevertheless, the spontaneous production of hydrogen coupled with organics valorization remains challenging. Herein, we develop ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowire (NW) catalysts for both electrochemical glucose oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction towards a spontaneous hydrogen production system. The more Pt&#8208;Au coordination and the localized tensile strain generated on twin boundaries of Au3Pt NWs facilitate the selective glucose electro&#8208;oxidation to gluconic acid (GNA) compared to Pt NWs (a low onset potential of 0.07 VRHE and selectivity &gt; 90%). In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Au3Pt NWs could reduce the energy barriers for GNA generation and alleviate the poisoning of Pt sites via a 'Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer' mechanism, which facilitates the desorption of strongly absorbed gluconolactone. Therefore, the asymmetric cell equipped with Au3Pt NW catalysts realizes the spontaneous hydrogen production and glucose valorization with a peak power of 50 mW, which outputs the voltage of 0.24 V at 50 mA cm&#8208;2, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The production of 1 kg H2 of the device is accompanied with $64.2 valorization of the anode product ($1200 ton&#8208;1 for GNA), and 5.36 kW h of generated electricity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Open&#8208;Shell Organic Radical in Enhancing Anti&#8208;Tumor Photocatalysis Reaction of NIR Light&#8208;Activated Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell radical materials, which are characterized by unpaired electrons, have led to revolutionary breakthroughs in material science due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the involvement of organic radicals in photodynamic therapy (PDT) has rarely been reported or discussed. This work studies two photosensitizer analogs. 4AM&#8208;OS with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation exhibits open&#8208;shell radical characters and enhanced type&#8208;I photodynamic activity compared with closed&#8208;shell 2AM&#8208;CS. 4AM&#8208;OS displays the thermally accessible triplet&#8208;state character, resulting in more unpaired electrons delocalized along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone at higher temperatures. Accordingly, the temperature&#8208;dependent photodynamic activity of 4AM&#8208;OS confirms its association with the open&#8208;shell electronic structure. As the unpaired electrons in open&#8208;shell 4AM&#8208;OS are more delocalized and generate additional electronic energy states, photo&#8208;induced charge transfer is promoted to facilitate type&#8208;I photodynamic reactions. This observation addresses the challenge associated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, such as 4AM&#8208;OS, which often demonstrate low efficacy in PDT due to the limited energy provided by NIR light despite its superior tissue penetration depth. Overall, clarifying the beneficial role of organic radicals in photodynamic reactions will bring revolutionary breakthroughs to developing high&#8208;performance NIR photosensitizers and promoting the efficacy of PDT for deep&#8208;seated lesions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Single Selenium Site for Selective Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Learning from nature has garnered significant attention in the scientific community for its potential to inspire creative solutions in material or catalyst design. The study reports a biomimetic single selenium (Se) site&#8208;modified carbon (C) moiety that retains the unique reactivity of selenoenzyme with peroxides, aiming to selectively catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The as&#8208;designed Se&#8208;C demonstrates nearly 100% 4&#8208;electron selectivity, evidenced by 0.039% of H2O2 yield at 0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming commercial platinum (Pt) by 65 times. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations attribute this exceptional selectivity to the enzyme&#8208;like behaviors of the Se site to steal an O atom from peroxide intermediates. The second achievement is the significantly increased consecutive 2+2 electron selectivity. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 reduction activity with a higher onset potential of 0.915 V compared to Pt at 0.875 V, the Se&#8208;C as a secondary catalytic site reduced the H2O2 yields of the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, and N&#8208;C catalysts by 96%, 67%, and 98%, respectively, via a consecutive 2+2 electron pathway. This also leads to more stable catalysts via protecting the active sites from oxidative attacks. This work establishes new pathways for precise tuning of reaction selectivity in ORR and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Reprocessable and Recyclable Materials for 3D Printing via Reversible Thia&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemically recyclable polymers for sustainable 3D printing is crucial to reducing plastic waste and advancing towards a circular polymer economy. Here, we introduce a new class of polythioenones (PCTE) synthesized via Michael addition&#8208;elimination ring&#8208;opening polymerization (MAEROP) of cyclic thioenone (CTE) monomers. The designed monomers are straightforward to synthesize, scalable and highly modular, and the resulting polymers display mechanical performance superior to commodity polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The material was successfully employed in 3D printing using fused&#8208;filament fabrication (FFF), showcasing excellent printability and mechanical recyclability. Notably, PCTE&#8208;Ph retains its tensile strength and thermal stability after multiple mechanical recycling cycles. Furthermore, PCTE&#8208;Ph can be depolymerized back to its original monomer with a 90% yield, allowing for repolymerization and establishing a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle, making it a sustainable alternative for additive manufacturing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Methane to Ethane and Propane Using Cobalt&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Activated GaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of methane (PNOCM) offers a promising route to synthesize valuable C2+ hydrocarbons while minimizing side reactions. Oxide&#8208;based photocatalysts have been predominant in this field, but suffering from limited conversion rates, selectivity, and durability due to poor C&#8208;C coupling as well as overoxidation of CH4 by lattice oxygen. Here, we introduce an advancement in PNOCM for methane conversion into ethane and propane using GaN, one of the most produced semiconductors, together with trace amounts of metallic cobalt clusters (0.1 wt%). The photocatalytic system exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining performance over 110 hours, achieving conversion rates of approximately 192.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for ethane and ~17.9 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for propane, with virtually no coke byproducts detected, representing the highest activity and stability ever reported to our knowledge. This high activity is attributed to the critical methane activation and C&#8208;C coupling on Co cluster, which can be greatly accelerated via the ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p&#8208;GaN to Co cluster. Additionally, the GaN support further synergistically enhances methane activation by in situ generating N&#8208;H and O&#8208;H species under reaction, as well as provides a vital anti&#8208;overoxidation effect to CH4 for high selectivity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Cation Specific Adsorption&#8208;Induced Built&#8208;In Electrostatic Field for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation battery technologies due to their high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, interfacial issues such as side reactions and Li dendrite growth severely hinder the practical application of SSLMBs. In this contribution, we proposed a cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field to drive the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The specific adsorption of tributylmethyl&#8208;phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TMPB) cations onto negatively charged Li anode surface significantly prevents interfacial side reactions between vulnerable polyethylene oxide (PEO) and Li metal. More importantly, the formed cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field induces the targeted trapping of Li&#8208;salt anions onto the Li metal surface, leading to the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered SEI, composed of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a Li&#8208;ion conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer. As a result, the Li||Li cell demonstrated an extended lifespan of over 1900 hours with the reduced polarization voltage. The Li||LiFePO4 full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability, maintaining an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.69% over 200 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides valuable insights into mitigating interfacial degradation and promoting uniform Li deposition through surface electrostatic field regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Active Site Covalent Organic Framework Anode Enables Stable Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous proton batteries&#160;(APBs) have attracted increasing interest owing to their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, there are limited anode materials and it remains a great challenge to effectively balance capacity and cycling performance. Here, we report a covalent organic framework containing C=O and C=N dual active sites (TABQ&#8208;COF) as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle anode for proton batteries. The proton storage ability of the dual active sites and the up to nine proton redox chemistry mechanisms for each repetitive unit have been demonstrated by experiments and density functional theory calculations. The insoluble TABQ&#8208;COF electrode displayed a remarkably high specific capacity of 401 mAh g&#8722;1, outstanding cycling stability (100% capacity retention after 7500 cycles) and high rate performance (90 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). When coupling with a MnO2 cathode, the constructed TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery achieves a reversible capacity of 247 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1,&#160;with a remarkable capacity retention of 100% over 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery can operate well and shows high capacity and cycle stability in a frozen electrolyte at &#8722;40&#176;C, implying great potential for energy storage at extreme temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;CO2 Battery at Elevated Temperatures: Advances with Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne and Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;CO2 batteries demonstrate promising prospects in terms of high&#8208;density energy storage and efficient CO2 fixation. However, their practical application is impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics and leakage of volatile and flammable organic electrolytes, especially for high temperature application scenarios, leading to large polarization and limited cycling stability. Herein, we fabricate a highly rechargeable and stable Li&#8208;CO2 battery with high temperature adaptability by employing fluorine&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvents. The employed FGDY, which possesses homogeneous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon, high specific surface area, and uniform pores, significantly enhances the battery reaction kinetics. Consequently, the fabricated Li&#8208;CO2 batteries operate consistently at a large current density of 5.0 A&#183;g&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C while showcasing high discharge capacity of 29050 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 along with excellent cycling stability. As proof of concept, Li&#8208;CO2 pouch cells achieve a high energy density of 536 Wh&#183;kg&#8208;1 based on the total mass of the device, and show outstanding cycling stability at 80 &#176;C. This study underscores the effectiveness of graphdiyne&#8208;derived carbon catalysts in achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Zn metal anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) faces daunting challenges including undesired water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and sluggish ion migration kinetics. Herein, we develop three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with bioinspired ion channels toward stabilized Zn anodes. These COFs, featured by zincophilic pyridine&#8208;N sites, enable effective regulation of water molecules at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Systematic experimental analysis and theoretical simulations reveal the optimized COF&#8208;320N membrane functions as ion pumps, accordingly facilitating Zn2+ transport and inhibiting direct contact between Zn anode and free water molecules. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired strategy achieves improved Zn2+ transference number (0.61), rapid de&#8208;solvation kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution. The assembled Zn||MnO2 pouch cell integrated with COF&#8208;320N membrane exhibits favorable electrochemical performances. Such a bioinspired concept for optimizing Zn anodes opens new pathways in developing advanced energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate Interaction to Activate C&#8722;N Bond for Exceptional Photoelectrochemical Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents a promising half&#8208;reaction for green hydrogen production, but the stable resonance structure of the urea molecule results in sluggish kinetics for breaking the C&#8722;N bond. Herein, we realize the record PEC UOR performance on a NiO&#8208;modified n&#8208;Si photoanode (NiO@Ni/n&#8208;Si) by harnessing the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction. We quantificationally unveil a dependence of the UOR activation barrier on the coverage of photogenerated surface high&#8208;valent Ni&#8208;oxo species (NiIV=O) by employing operando PEC spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations. The strong attraction between NiIV=O and adsorbed urea facilitates their N&#8722;O coupling while weakening the C&#8722;N bonding within urea, manifesting as the decreased UOR activation energy from 0.74 to 0.41 eV when the surface coverage of NiIV=O is enhanced from zero to full, corresponding to more than two orders of magnitude enhancement for the UOR rate. Furthermore, an industrial&#8208;grade photocurrent density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at a potential as low as 1.08 VRHE by stimulating the NiIV=O accumulation under 10 Suns, which is 300 mV lower than the potential required for most reported electrochemical counterparts. This work opens new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance PEC urea oxidation via adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Superconjugated Anthraquinone Carbonyl&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Material for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently been emerged as promising anode candidates for aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs), but suitable COFs need to be developed and the energy storage mechanisms need to be further investigated. Here we report an anthraquinone carbonyl&#8208;containing COF as anode for AAIBs, which exhibits a high specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and good cycling stability with 90% retention after 8000 cycles at 6 A g&#8208;1. We find that the anthraquinone carbonyls (denoted as C=O1) with superconjugated structure in the COF can form hydrogen bonds with NH4+ ions, thus serving as optimal sites and providing the major contribution to NH4+ ion storage, whereas another type of carbonyls (denoted as C=O2) in the same COF suffers from enol&#8208;keto tautomerism, which prevents the formation of hydrogen bonds and is therefore unfavourable for NH4+ ion storage. This is further verified by the theoretical calculations where the hydrogen bonding rate of C=O1 groups is much faster than that of C=O2. This work not only provides insights into understanding the mechanism of NH4+ ion storage, but also offers new ideas for the design of advanced COF&#8208;based materials for AAIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Employing Octahedral Net Charge Descriptors for Designing High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, aqueous proton batteries have shown promise for electrochemical energy storage using MXene electrodes. However, designing high&#8208;performance MXene proton batteries remains challenging due to the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the vast chemical composition space of MXene, and the unclear proton transport mechanism. To tackle these challenges, we established a general descriptor based on structural units of MXenes, termed the octahedral net charge descriptor (Qoct). This descriptor correlates well with HER activity, capacity, and proton transport performance. Based on the descriptor, prediction reveals a dual&#8208;proton storage mechanism per site in N&#8208;functionalized MXene. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the descriptor is verified across a broader MXene chemical space. Additionally, the kinetic process shows the topological transformation energy barrier of the interfacial solution is profoundly influenced by Qoct, thereby impacting the proton transfer performance. This universal descriptor originates from the different electron filling states on the molecular orbitals of the octahedron. Overall, this work provides an efficient strategy for designing MXene proton batteries and can be extended to other battery and catalysis fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Valence States of the [4Fe4S] Cluster Revealed in the Hydrogenase CrHydA1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters play a crucial role in electron transfer for many essential enzymes, including [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This study focuses on the [4Fe4S] cluster ([4Fe]H) of the minimal&#160;[FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from&#160;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&#160;(CrHydA1) and employs advanced spectroscopy, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and QM/MM calculations. We provide insights into the complex electronic structure of&#160;[4Fe]H&#160;and its role in the catalytic reaction of&#160;CrHydA1, serving as paradigm for understanding [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. We identified at least two distinct species&#160;within the apo&#8208;form of&#160;CrHydA1, designated 4Fe&#8208;R and 4Fe&#8208;A, with unique redox potentials and pH sensitivities. Our findings revealed that these species arise from a complex interplay of structural heterogeneity and valence isomer rearrangements, influenced by second&#8208;sphere residues. We propose that the interconversion between 4Fe&#8208;R and 4Fe&#8208;A could provide control over electron transfer in the absence of accessory FeS clusters typically found in other [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases but also provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into analysis of other FeS clusters across diverse biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;sensitive polyglycerol nanogels for periodontitis treatment through antibacterial and pro&#8208;angiogenesis action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Periodontitis is a microbe&#8208;driven inflammatory disease leading to bone resorption and tissue destruction. We propose a dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO) for combating microbial pathogens and promoting tissue regeneration. The nanogel system (NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO) that we fabricated from linear polyglycerol exhibits well&#8208;defined spherical morphology and a positively charged surface for bacteria adhesion. The rapid and sustained degradation of NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO in the acidic environment of an infection site induces the on&#8208;demand release of TCS and DFO. The NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO shows potent bacteria elimination of the gingivitis&#8208;causing bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis in both planktonic (99.9%) and biofilm (99%) states. Furthermore, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO can promote vascularization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Contributing to the synergistic effect of TCS and DFO, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO demonstrates significant bone tissue regeneration and accelerated healing of periodontitis in vivo. This polyglycerol&#8208;based nanogel may therefore offer smart combined delivery of multiple therapeutics against bacteria&#8208;driven diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting C&#8208;O Bond Cleavage and Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Activity via Enriched in&#8208;plane Sulfur Vacancies in Single&#8208;Layer Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to the production of valuable chemicals through CO2 utilization. However, challenges persist with the rapid deactivation and insufficient activity of catalysts. Herein, we developed a soft&#8208;hard dual&#8208;template method to synthesize layered MoS2 using inexpensive and scalable templates, enabling facile regulation of sulfur vacancies by controlling the number of layers. The concentration of in&#8208;plane vacancies keeps increasing with the reduction of MoS2 layer number, contributing to 100% CO selectivity over single&#8208;layer MoS2 and a stable performance over 300&#8208;hour reaction at 600 &#176;C. The space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of CO reached 35.7 gCO gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, outperforming most current catalysts. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancy sites endowed enhanced production of CO via direct dissociation of CO2, showing an intrinsic activity of above 5.8 times higher than that of edge sulfur vacancy sites. The rate&#8208;limiting step was shifted from C&#8208;O cleavage in edge to sulfur vacancy regeneration in plane with a lower energy barrier. Our findings exemplified the specified design and synthesis of MoS2 for high&#8208;temperature CO2 reduction through the effective manipulation of distinct vacancy sites, shedding light on their potential industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Easily Water&#8208;Synthesisable Iron&#8208;Chloranilate Frameworks as High Energy and High&#8208;Power Cathodes for Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high battery performance from low&#8208;cost, easily synthesisable electrode materials is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) combining inexpensive transition metals and organic ligands are promising candidates for high&#8208;capacity cathodes. Iron&#8208;chloranilate&#8208;water frameworks are herein reported to be produced in aqueous media under mild conditions. Removal of reticular water from known [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]&#183;4H2O yields a new supramolecular metal&#8208;organic framework (SMOF), [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]. Removing coordination water, a new 2D honeycomb&#8208;like MOF forms, Fe2(CAN)3, stable without counterions and solvent. This MOF adopts the unusual ABC layer&#8208;stacking, as determined using a combination of ab initio random structure searching, electron diffraction, and Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data. Magnetometry, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy confirm that all three [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)x]&#183;yH2O phases contain HS&#8208;Fe3+ and CAN2&#8211;, with magnetic ordering temperatures increasing (5&#8594;20K) as the Fe&#8211;CAN connectivity increases. The SMOF and MOF show reversible (de)insertion of &gt;4Li+/f.u. at average 2.59 V and 2.76 V vs Li+/Li, respectively. [Fe2(CAN)3] achieves 146 mAh/g at 1C, thus specific energy (563 Wh/kg) and power (446 W/kg) in Li half&#8208;cells competitive with conventional LiFePO4 (~580 Wh/kg and ~450 W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe2(CAN)3] delivers 394 Wh/kg and 421 Wh/kg, for Na and K half&#8208;cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.</dc:description>

[Fe2(CAN)3] achieves 146 mAh/g at 1C, thus specific energy (563 Wh/kg) and power (446 W/kg) in Li half-cells competitive with conventional LiFePO4 (~580 Wh/kg and ~450 W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe2(CAN)3] delivers 394 Wh/kg and 421 Wh/kg, for Na and K half-cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiscale Engineered Bionic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes Breaking the Stiffness&#8208;Damping Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation devices for energy storage due to their safety and high energy density. The issues of lithium dendrites and poor mechanical compatibility with electrodes present the need for developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high stiffness and damping, but it is a contradictory relationship. Here, inspired by the superstructure of tooth enamel, we develop a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous ceramic nanotube arrays intertwined with solid polymer electrolytes. This bionic electrolyte exhibits both high stiffness (Young&#8242;s modulus=15GPa, hardness = 0.13GPa) and damping (tan&#948;= 0.08), breaking the trade&#8208;off. Thus, this composite electrolyte can not only inhibit Li dendrites growth but also ensure intimate contact with electrodes. Meanwhile, it also exhibits considerable Li+ transference number (0.62) and room temperature ionic conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), which is attributed to oxygen vacancies of the amorphous ceramic effectively decoupling the Li&#8722;TFSI ion pair. Consequently, the assembled Li symmetrical battery shows an ultra&#8208;stable cycling (&gt;2000 hours at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2 at 60 &#176;C, &gt;500hours at 0.1mA cm&#8722;2 at 30 &#176;C). Moreover, the LiFePO4/Li and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells both show excellent cycling performance. We demonstrate that this bionic strategy is a promising approach for the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.</dc:description>
