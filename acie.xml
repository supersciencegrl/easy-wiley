         <title>Anion Chemistry towards On&#8208;Site Construction of Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Metallic Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversibility of metallic Zn anode serves as the corner stone for the development of aqueous Zn metal battery, which motivates scrutinizing the electrolyte&#8208;Zn interface. As the representative organic zinc salt, zinc trifluorosulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) facilitates a broad class of aqueous electrolytes, however, the stability issue of Zn anode remains crucial. The great challenge lies in the lack of Zn anode protection by the pristinely formed surface structure in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes. Accordingly, an electrochemical route was developed to grow a uniform zinc trifluorosulfonate hydroxide (ZTH) layer on Zn anode as an artificial SEI, via regulation on metal dissolution and strong coordination ability of zinc ions. Co&#8208;precipitation was proposed to be the formation mechanism for the artificial SEI, where the reduction stability of OTf&#8254; anion and the low&#8208;symmetry layer structure of ZTH was unmasked. This artificial SEI favors interfacial kinetics, depresses side reactions, and well maintains its integrity during cycling, leading to a prolonged lifespan of Zn stripping/plating with a high DOD of ~85%, and an improved cycling stability of ~92% retention rate for V2O5/Zn cell at 1 A g&#8208;1. The unveiled role of anion on Zn anode drives the contemplation on the surface chemistry for the blooming aqueous rechargeable battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective Recovery of Gold from E&#8208;Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The existing electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and leaching solutions generated by industries accumulate significant amounts of gold (Au), even in excess of those in natural minerals. Therefore, the recycling of Au is extremely significant for the potential sustainability of chemical industry. By designing ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), here we synthesize a series of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;X (X=Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, AcO&#8208;, and SO42&#8208;) by anion regulation strategy. All these ionic COFs exhibit ultrahigh gold adsorption efficiency and excellent regeneration. Moreover, anion regulation could indeed affect the Au capture performance. In particular, when Cl&#8208; ions serve as counter ions, the Au capacity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl could reach 1270.8 mg g&#8208;1. Moreover, in the actual CPU leaching solution test, the selectivity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl towards Au3+ ion hits 39000 and 4600 times higher than that of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions, respectively, suggesting that the Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl is a promising material for highly selective recovering gold from actual e&#8208;waste. DFT calculations further reveal that counter ions can regulate the adsorption affinity of ionic COF framework toward Au. In short, this work provides a useful anion regulation strategy to design ionic COFs as a promising platform for gold selective recovery from actual e&#8208;waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipole Moment Modulation of Terminal Groups Enables Asymmetric Acceptors Featuring Medium Bandgap for Efficient and Stable Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study puts forth a novel&#160;terminal group&#160;design to&#160;develop&#160;medium&#8208;bandgap Y&#8208;series acceptors beyond conventional side&#8208;chain engineering.&#160;We focused on&#160;the strategical integration of an electron&#8208;donating methoxy group and an electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen atom&#160;at&#160;benzene&#8208;fused&#160;terminal groups. This combination precisely&#160;modulated&#160;the&#160;dipole moment and electron density of terminal groups, effectively attenuating intramolecular charge transfer&#160;effect, and widening the bandgap of&#160;acceptors. The incorporation of these&#160;terminal&#160;groups yielded two asymmetric acceptors, named BTP&#8208;2FClO and BTP&#8208;2FBrO, both of which exhibited open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) as high as 0.96 V in binary devices, representing the&#160;highest&#160;VOCs among the asymmetric Y&#8208;series&#160;small molecule acceptors. More importantly, both BTP&#8208;2FClO and BTP&#8208;2FBrO exhibit&#160;modest&#160;aggregation behaviors&#160;and&#160;molecular crystallinity,&#160;making them&#160;suitable as a third component to mitigate excess aggregation of the PM6: BTP&#8208;eC9 blend and optimize the&#160;devices&#8217;&#160;morphology.&#160;As a result,&#160;the optimized BTP&#8208;2FClO&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved a remarkable power conversion&#160;efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 19.34%, positioning it among the highest&#8208;performing OSCs.&#160;Our&#160;study&#160;highlights the&#160;molecular design&#160;importance on manipulating dipole moments and electron density&#160;in&#160;developing&#160;medium&#8208;bandgap acceptors,&#160;and&#160;offers&#160;a highly efficient third component for&#160;high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mass Transfer Rate in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Achieved with Efficient Quasi&#8208;Gas Phase System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adhesion of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface is one of the main factors limiting the performance of H2 evolution of electrolytic water, especially at high current density. To overcome this problem, here a "quasi&#8208;gas phase" electrolytic water reaction system based on capillary effect is proposed for the first time to improve the mass transfer efficiency of H2. The typical feature of this reaction system is that the main site of H2 evolution reaction is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment above the bulk aqueous solution, thus effectively inhibiting the aggregation of H2 bubbles and reducing the resistance of their diffusion away. Electrochemical test results show that the proposed quasi&#8208;gas phase system can significantly reduce the potential required in H2 evolution reaction process at high current density compared with the conventional electrolytic reaction system. Specifically, the overpotential potential is reduced by 0.31 V when the H2 evolution current density of 250 mA cm&#8208;2 is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodicarbene&#8208;Stibenium Ion&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8211;H and C(sp)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main&#8208;group element&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H activation remains experimentally challenging, and the development of clear concepts and design principles have been limited by the increased reactivity of relevant complexes, especially for the heavier elements. Herein, we report that the stibenium ion [(pyCDC)Sb][NTf2]3&#160;(1) (pyCDC = bis&#8208;pyridyl carbodicarbene; NTf2&#160;= bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) reacts with acetonitrile in the presence of the base 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#173;&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp3)&#8211;H bond breaking to generate the stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile complex [(pyCDC)Sb(CH2CN)][NTf2]2&#160;(2). Kinetic analyses were performed to elucidate the rate dependence for all the substrates involved in the reaction. Computational studies suggest that C&#8211;H activation proceeds via a mechanism in which acetonitrile first coordinates to the Sb center through the nitrogen atom in a&#160;&#954;1&#160;fashion, thereby weakening the C&#8211;H bond which can then be deprotonated by base in solution. Further, we show that&#160;1&#160;reacts with terminal alkynes in the presence of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#173;&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp)&#8211;H bond breaking to form stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts of the type [(pyCDC)Sb(CCR)][NTf2]2&#160;(3a&#8208;f). Compound&#160;1&#160;shows excellent specificity for the activation of the terminal C(sp)&#8211;H bond even across alkynes with diverse functionality. The resulting stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile and stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts react with elemental iodine (I2) to produce iodoacetonitrile and iodoalkynes, while regenerating an Sb trication.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Luminophore Molecular Engineering for Rapidly Phototunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Smart materials enabling emission intensity or wavelength tuning by light stimulus attract attention in numerous cutting&#8208;edge fields. However, due to the generally dense molecular stacking against photoresponsivity in solid states, especially in crystals, developing rapidly phototunable solid&#8208;state luminescent systems remains challenging. Herein, we propose a new luminophore that serves as both a photoresponsive unit and a luminescent group, while possessing enhanced conformational freedom to provide a solution. Namely, photoexcitation&#8208;induced molecular conformational change of an ionized persulfurated arene based on weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction was employed. On these basis, rapidly enhanced phosphorescence upon irradiation can be observed in a series of phase states, like solution state, crystal, and amorphous state, especially with a high photoresponsive rate of 0.033 s&#8208;1 in crystal state that is superior to the relevant reported cases. Moreover, a rapidly phototunable afterglow effect is achieved by extending this molecule into some polymer&#8208;based doping systems, endowing the system with unique dynamic imaging and fast photopatterning capabilities. Such a single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering and the underlying mechanism have implications for building different condensed functional materials, principally for those with stimuli responses in solid states.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based Framework Stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Interactions with Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960; frameworks, defined as a type of porous supramolecular materials weaved from conjugated molecular units by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, provide a new direction in photocatalysis. However, such examples are rarely reported. Herein, we report a supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework constructed from a photoactive Cu(I) complex unit. Structurally, 24 Cu(I) complex units stack together through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, forming a truncated octahedral nanocage with sodalite topology. The inner diameter of the nanocage is 2.8 nm. By sharing four open faces, each nanocage connects with four equivalent ones, forming a 3D porous &#960; framework (&#960;&#8208;2). &#960;&#8208;2 shows good thermal and chemical stability, which can adsorb CO2, iodine, and methyl orange molecules. More importantly, &#960;&#8208;2 can serve as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. With ultrafine Pt subnanometer particles (0.9&#177;0.1 nm) incorporated into the nanocages as a co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches a record&#8208;high value of 517551 &#956;mol/gPt/h in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the ultrafine size of the Pt particles, as well as the fast electron transfer from &#960;&#8208;2 to the highly active Pt upon illumination. &#960;&#8208;2 represents the unique stable supramolecular&#8208;cage&#8208;based &#960; framework with excellent photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Molecules for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;withdrawing molecules (EWMs) have exhibited remarkable efficacy in boosting the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the underneath mechanisms governing their positive attributes remain inadequately understood. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive study on EWMs by comparing 2,2'&#8208;(2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene) bismalononitrile (TCNQ) and (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene) dimalononitrile (F4TCNQ) employed at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces. Our findings reveal that EWMs simultaneously enhance chemical passivation, interface dipole effect, and chemically binding of the perovskite to the HTL. Notably, F4TCNQ, with its superior electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, demonstrates a more pronounced impact. Consequently, PCSs modified with F4TCNQ achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21%, while demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the PCE of a larger&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0 cm2) based on F4TCNQ reached 21.41%. This work illuminates the multifaceted mechanisms of EWMs at the interfaces in PSCs, delivering pivotal insights that pave the way for the sophisticated design and strategic application of EWMs, thereby propelling the advancement of perovskite photovoltaic technology</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Strongly Coupled Metal/Hydroxide Heterostructure Cascades Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Reduction Reactions toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C&#8211;N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag&#8208;CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag&#8208;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6 mmol gcat.&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual&#8208;site catalysts for C&#8211;N coupling, considering their role on the interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Potassium Decahydrido&#8208;Monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;Decaborate Imidazole Complex Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries have caught increasing interest owing to their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high energy/power density. However, their development is generally constrained by the lack of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a new complex KCB9H10&#183;2C3H4N2, synthesized by grinding and heating the mixture of potassium decahydrido&#8208;monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;decaborate (KCB9H10) and imidazole (C3H4N2) under mild conditions, to achieve the K&#8208;ion superionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The crystal structure was revealed as an orthorhombic lattice with the space group of Pna21 by FOX software. The diffusion properties for K+ in the crystal structure were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI&#8208;NEB) method. KCB9H10&#183;2C3H4N2 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, four orders of magnitude higher than that of KCB9H10. This ionic conductivity is also the highest value of hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors reported. Moreover, KCB9H10&#183;2C3H4N2 demonstrated a K+ transference number of 0.96, an electrochemical stability window of 1.2 to 3.2 V vs. K/K+, and good stability against the K metal coated by a layer of potassium imidazolate (KIm). These great performances make KCB9H10&#183;2C3H4N2 a promising K&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Are Hydroxyl Radicals Spontaneously Generated in Unactivated Water Droplets?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous ionization/breakup of water at the surface of aqueous droplets has been reported with evidence ranging from formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, indicated by ions at m/z 36 attributed to OH&#8226;&#8208;H3O+ or (H2O&#8208;OH2)+&#8226; as well as oxidation products of radical scavengers in mass spectra of water droplets formed by pneumatic nebulization.

         <title>Integrated &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy for High&#8208;Rate Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECR) is a promising pathway to producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Despite extensive studies reported, improving CO2 adsorption for local CO2 enrichment or water dissociation to generate sufficient H* is still not enough to achieve industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Herein, we report a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi nanosheets modified by CrOx (Bi&#8208;CrOx), to simultaneously promote CO2 adsorption and water dissociation, thereby enhancing the activity and selectivity of ECR to formate. The Bi&#8208;CrOx exhibits an excellent Faradic efficiency (&#8776; 100 %) in a wide potential range from &#8210;0.4 to &#8210;0.9 V. In addition, it achieves a remarkable formate partial current density of 687 mA cm&#8210;2 at a moderate potential of &#8210;0.9 V without iR compensation, the highest value at &#8210;0.9 V reported so far. Control experiments and theoretical simulations revealed that the defective Bi facilitates CO2 adsorption/activation while the CrOx accounts for enhancing the protonation process via accelerating H2O dissociation. This work presents a pathway to boosting formate production through tuning CO2 and H2O species at the same time.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild and Scalable Conditions for the Solvothermal Synthesis of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient method was developed that allows for the synthesis of highly crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in hours. The use of an apolar solvent in combination with a precise amount of water and acetic acid was crucial to obtain materials of optimal quality. Twelve different COFs could be produced under the same reaction conditions, using a green solvent mixture of n&#8208;butanol, acetic acid and water at 70 &#176;C for 16 hours with stirring. The crystallinity of the COFs produced in this manner is similar or better than that obtained by traditional solvothermal synthesis. The method could be easily scaled to synthesize over ten grams of COF in one batch. Optical microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy gave insight in the role of the solvent on the aggregation of COF nanosheets and the resulting crystallinity, porosity and robustness of the material.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Phosphorus on Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis for Ruthenium Phosphides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline HOR performance of ruthenium&#8208;based phosphides were explored to investigate the catalytic role of phosphorus. P&#8208;species induced orbital overlap and d&#8208;band structure regulation would optimally enhance the hydroxyl binding energy under moderate P&#8208;content, which increase the proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water with improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond network and subsequently boost the HOR kinetics.







Abstract
Transition metal/p&#8208;block compounds are regarded as the most essential materials for electrochemical energy converting systems involving various electrocatalysis. Understanding the role of p&#8208;block element on the interaction of key intermediates and interfacial water molecule orientation at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface during the electrocatalysis is important for rational designing advanced p&#8208;block modified metal electrocatalysts. Herein, taking a sequence of ruthenium phosphides (including Ru2P, RuP and RuP2) as model catalysts, we establish a volcanic&#8208;relation between P&#8208;proportion and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. The dominant role of P for regulating hydroxyl binding energy is validated by active sites poisoning experiments, pH&#8208;dependent infection&#8208;point behavior, in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, in which P could tailor the d&#8208;band structure of Ru, optimize the hydroxyl adsorption sites across the Ru&#8722;P moieties, thereby leading to improved proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and facilitated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, which are responsible for the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>Integrating Multipolar Structures and Carboxyl Groups in sp2&#8208;Carbon Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated sp2&#8208;c covalent organic framework integrated with multipolar structures and enrichment sites have been prepared for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from optimal multipolar structures and functional sites, TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH facilitated charge transfer and mass movement during the photocatalysis process, leading to highly efficient ORR performance with a H2O2 production rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The direct production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through photocatalytic reaction via H2O and O2 is considered as an ideal approach. However, the efficiency of H2O2 generation is generally limited by insufficient charge and mass transfer. Covalent organic framework (COFs) offer a promising platform as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for H2O2 production due to their potential for rational design at the molecular level. Herein, we integrated the multipolar structures and carboxyl groups into COFs to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water without any sacrificial agents. The introduction of octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with an increase of molecular planarity, created efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups could not only boost O2 and H2O2 movement via enhancement of pore hydrophilicity, but also promote proton conduction, enabling the conversion to H2O2 from &#8901;O2&#8722;, which is the crucial intermediate product in H2O2 photocatalysis. Overall, we demonstrate that TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH, consisting of optimal octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with enrichment sites (carboxyl groups), exhibited a H2O2 yield rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722; 1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (SCC) efficiency of 0.55&#8201;%. This work provides valuable insights for designing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

     alt="Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two-Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By substituting the A-site ions of two-dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron-hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non-overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Anion&#8208;Selective Catalysis for Stable Lithium Metal Pouch Cells through Charge Separated COF Interlayer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy for Li metal anode is reported by charge&#8208;separated TP&#8208;COF. The strong adsorption between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries were achieved under realistic conditions.







Abstract
Regulating the composition of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) is the key to construct high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries. Here we report a selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy to achieve a lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich SEI for stable lithium metal batteries. To accomplish this, the tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) amine&#8208;pyromeletic dianhydride covalent organic frameworks (TP&#8208;COF) was adopted as an interlayer on lithium metal anode. The strong donor&#8208;acceptor unit structure of TP&#8208;COF induces local charge separation, resulting in electron depletion and thus boosting its affinity to FSI&#8722;. The strong interaction between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. This feature facilitates rapid Li+ transfer and suppresses dendritic Li growth. Notably, we demonstrate a 6.5&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|TP&#8208;COF@Li pouch cell with high energy density (473.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (97.4&#8201;%, 95&#8197;cycles) under lean electrolyte 1.39&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, high areal capacity 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high current density 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our selective catalysis strategy opens a promising avenue toward the practical applications of high energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Enabling Efficient Anchoring&#8208;Conversion Interface by Fabricating Double&#8208;Layer Functionalized Separator for Suppressing Shuttle Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, where Co/CoN4 layer serves as adsorption&#8208;catalytic centers for high&#8208;order and low&#8208;order LiPSs, combined with 2D MXene layer that acts as the second barrier for additional leaked LiPSs, and thus a circulation interface of adsorption&#8208;conversion&#8208;reactivation of S species has been realized, effectively alleviating the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur/selenium batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs) with high energy density still face challenges on sluggish conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and low blocking feature of ordinary separators to LiPSs. To tackle these, a novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, which consists of Co with atomically dispersed CoN4 decorated on Ketjen black (Co/CoN4@KB) layer and an ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene layer. The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while CoN4 active sites facilitate the absorption of short&#8208;chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li2S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor the leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN4@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring&#8208;conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8197;S&#8221; and Li2S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN4@KB&#8208;MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double&#8208;layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption&#8208;catalytic interface, enabling high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.

         <title>Dissociative Electron Attachment Dynamics of a Promising Cancer Drug Indicates Its Radiosensitizing Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Bromo&#8208;1&#8208;(3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one (RRx&#8208;001) has been suggested as a potential radiosensitizer. Here we explored the decay of the molecule upon electron attachment. The main dissociation processes of the formed anion are characterized by loss of either a bromine atom or a NO2 group, both competing for the excess electron. The fast chemistry observed may also indicate an alternative avenue for oxygenation of hypoxic tumor cells.







Abstract
2&#8208;Bromo&#8208;1&#8208;(3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one (RRx&#8208;001) is a hypoxic cell chemotherapeutics with already demonstrated synergism in combined chemo&#8208;radiation therapy. The interaction of the compound with secondary low&#8208;energy electrons formed in large amounts during the physico&#8208;chemical phase of the irradiation may lead to these synergistic effects. The present study focuses on the first step of RRx&#8208;001 interaction with low&#8208;energy electrons in which a transient anion is formed and fragmented. Combination of two experiments allows us to disentangle the decay of the RRx&#8208;001 anion on different timescales.

&lt;p&gt;2-Bromo-1-(3,3-dinitroazetidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one (RRx-001) has been suggested as a potential radiosensitizer. Here we explored the decay of the molecule upon electron attachment. The main dissociation processes of the formed anion are characterized by loss of either a bromine atom or a NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group, both competing for the excess electron. The fast chemistry observed may also indicate an alternative avenue for oxygenation of hypoxic tumor cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-Bromo-1-(3,3-dinitroazetidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one (RRx-001) is a hypoxic cell chemotherapeutics with already demonstrated synergism in combined chemo-radiation therapy. The interaction of the compound with secondary low-energy electrons formed in large amounts during the physico-chemical phase of the irradiation may lead to these synergistic effects. The present study focuses on the first step of RRx-001 interaction with low-energy electrons in which a transient anion is formed and fragmented. Combination of two experiments allows us to disentangle the decay of the RRx-001 anion on different timescales. Sole presence of the electron initiates rapid dissociation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; neutrals while NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions are produced both directly and via intermediate complexes. Based on our quantum chemical calculations, we propose that bidirectional state switching between &#960;*(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and &#963;*(C&#8722;Br) states explains the experimental spectra. The fast dynamics monitored will impact the condensed phase chemistry of the anion as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axial Biaryls by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Using Engineered Imine Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) was developed. This DKR approach features a transient aza&#8208;acetal bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an engineered imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to generate the axial chirality, providing various biaryls in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er).







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl compounds are ubiquitous scaffolds in natural products, bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts, but biocatalytic methods for their asymmetric synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). This DKR approach features a transient six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;acetal&#8208;bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to construct the axial chirality under ambient conditions. Directed evolution of an IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 provided a variant (S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11) capable of catalyzing the DKR process to access a variety of biaryl aminoalcohols in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio). Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11 variant revealed the origin of its improved activity and atroposelectivity. By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of IREDs and the power of directed evolution, our work further extends the biocatalysts&#8217; toolbox to construct challenging axially chiral molecules.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulator&#8208;transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]&#8208;[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8593;a1g&#8593; eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;a1g&#8593;&#8595; eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

The addition of ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, which brings about electron&#8208;rich surface sites that stabilize the *CO intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2H4 product with high selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) feedstocks, such as C2H4, holds great promise in direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. Nevertheless, the performance is largely inhibited by the high energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2+ products with low selectivity. Here we report that through facile surface immobilization of a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM&#8208;BF4) ionic liquid, plasmonic Cu nanowires could enable highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 product. At an optimal condition, the resultant plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits C2H4 production with selectivity up to 96.7&#8201;% under 450&#8197;nm monochromatic light irradiation, greatly surpassing its pristine Cu counterpart. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations unravel that the addition of EMIM&#8208;BF4 ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, resulting in its enhanced adsorption strength of *CO intermediate and significantly reduced energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process. This work paves new path for Cu surface plasmons in selective artificial photosynthesis to targeted products.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

         <title>Benign and Selective Amination of Lignins towards Aromatic Biobased Building Blocks with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research article presents two new benign methodologies to access reactive and soluble lignin&#8208;based polyamines. The aminated lignin products have potential as renewable building blocks in aromatic polymeric materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents, for instance.







Abstract
Lignin is a widely available second&#8208;generation biopolymer and the main potential source of renewable aromatic building blocks. Lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential in applications based on chemical and materials sciences. However, common aminations techniques for lignin usually involve toxic chemicals and generate hindered and low reactivity amines.
In this study, we developed two new, simple, and benign 2&#8208;step methodologies for the elaboration of lignin&#8208;based polyamines from different technical lignins (kraft, soda and organosolv) with a selectivity towards reactive primary amines. These methods involve grafting amide groups onto lignin followed by a hydrolysis step. Non&#8208;toxic heterocyclic compounds N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline were used as amidation agents. Hydrolysis was performed in acetone&#8208;water mixtures. Reactions were studied on model compounds and optimized on lignins. Aminated lignins were fully characterized and primary amines were quantified using quantitative 19F&#8197;NMR.
Our methods generated aminated lignins with low apparent molar masses and high solubility in water and solvents. Nitrogen contents of the products ranged between 2.0 and 3.5&#8197;mmol/g with reactive primary amines counts up to 1.7&#8197;mmol/g. These soluble and reactive lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential as a replacement for fossil&#8208;based polyamines in e.g., the synthesis of aromatic polymer materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents.

         <title>Formate&#8208;Mediated Electroenzymatic Synthesis via Biological Cofactor NADH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroenzyme&#8208;coupled system has been constructed for continuous biosynthesis of valuable chemicals with high production rates and turnover frequencies. In the system, formate is obtained from electroreduction of CO2 with good faradic efficiency at high current density and utilized for NADH regeneration with high selectivity. As a temporary energy carrier, formate ensures efficient energy transfer from electricity to chemical production.







Abstract
Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature's machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. Utilizing a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2 reduction to formate with approximately 90&#8201;% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilized redox enzymes&#8212;alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)&#8212;to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8&#215;106 to 3.1&#215;106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.

         <title>Chelator&#8208;Assisted Precipitation&#8208;Based Separation of the Rare Earth Elements Neodymium and Dysprosium from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Using a novel chelator, G&#8208;macropa, a highly efficient and environmentally friendly precipitation&#8208;based rare earth element separation approach is achieved. @JWilsonLab







Abstract
The rare earth elements (REEs) are critical resources for many clean energy technologies, but are difficult to obtain in their elementally pure forms because of their nearly identical chemical properties. Here, an analogue of macropa, G&#8208;macropa, was synthesized and employed for an aqueous precipitation&#8208;based separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+. G&#8208;macropa maintains the same thermodynamic preference for the large REEs as macropa, but shows smaller thermodynamic stability constants. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the binding affinity differences of these chelators for Nd3+ and Dy3+ is a consequence of the presence or absence of an inner&#8208;sphere water molecule, which alters the donor strength of the macrocyclic ethers. Leveraging the small REE affinity of G&#8208;macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd3+, Dy3+, and G&#8208;macropa, the addition of HCO3&#8722; selectively precipitates Dy2(CO3)3, leaving the Nd3+&#8722;G&#8208;macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50&#8201;:&#8201;50 and 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd3+:Dy3+ ratios of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G&#8208;macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Based Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Structures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework denoted as 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) with fine&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor interaction is demonstrated to establish a rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport channel and induce uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The appearance of disordered lithium dendrites and fragile solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) significantly hinder the serviceability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework with partially electronegative channels (4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) is incorporated as a protective layer to modulate the interface stability of the lithium metal batteries. Notably, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF with optimized electronic structure at the molecular level by fine&#8208;tuning the local acceptor&#8208;donor functionalities not only enhances the intermolecular interaction thereby providing larger dipole moment and improved crystallinity and mechanical stress, but also facilitates the beneficial effect of lithiophilic sites (C&#8722;F bonds, triazine cores, C=N linkages and aromatic rings) to further regulate the migration of Li+ and achieve a uniform lithium deposition behavior as determined by various in&#8208;depth in/ex situ characterizations. Due to the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;component organic functionalities, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF modified full cells perform significantly better than the common two/three&#8208;component 2C&#8208;TA&#8208;CTF and 3C&#8208;TF&#8208;CTF electrodes, delivering an excellent capacity of 116.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (capacity retention ratio: 86.8&#8201;%) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C and improved rate capability. This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes is described that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles at the internal position, including primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and an ammonia surrogate. Two complementary set of conditions allow embedding both electronically activated and deactivated styrenes bearing diverse functional groups.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.

Fluorescent probe for discovering the critical roles of CYP2D6 in natural systems: A fluorescent probe for CYP2D6 is designed using a tailored molecular strategy. The probe quantitatively detects and images CYP2D6 activity in various living systems, thereby providing a robust tool for exploration of the biological functions of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases and detailed investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme that mediates the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances in humans. However, its biological role in drug&#8208;drug interactions especially mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI), and various diseases remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for selectively monitoring CYP2D6 in complex biological systems. Herein, using a tailored molecular strategy, we developed a fluorescent probe BDPM for CYP2D6. BDPM exhibits excellent specificity and imaging capability for CYP2D6, making it suitable for the real&#8208;time monitoring of endogenous CYP2D6 activity in living bio&#8208;samples. Therefore, our tailored strategy proved useful for constructing the highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes. BDPM as a molecular tool to explore the critical roles of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases, high&#8208;throughput screening of inhibitors and intensive investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Electrolytes with Controllable Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A HOF&#8208;based novel solid&#8208;state electrolyte was constructed by taking advantage of the abundant multisite hydrogen bonding and stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in HOF&#8208;DAT. Benefiting from the abundant C=O groups in the HOF backbone as ion hopping sites and the flexible hydrogen bonding skeleton of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, a fast Li+ ion conductivity (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V were achieved.







Abstract
The lack of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and the rational design of electrode/electrolyte interfaces remains challenging for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) battery is developed based on the Li&#8208;ion&#8208;conducted hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (LHOF) electrolyte and the HOF&#8208;DAT@CNT composite cathode. Benefiting from the abundant dynamic hydrogen bonding network in the backbone of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, fast Li+ ion transport (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V are achieved. Symmetric batteries constructed with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs exhibit a stably cycled duration of over 1400&#8197;h with uniform deposition, which mainly stems from the jumping sites that promote a uniformly high rate of Li+ flux and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network structure that can relieve the structural changes during Li+ transport. LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs&#8208;based Li&#8722;O2 batteries exhibit high specific capacity (10335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable cycling life up to 150 cycles. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs endow good rate capability (129.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (210 cycles). The design of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs opens an avenue for the development of novel SSEs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Vaporchromic Domino Transformation and Polarized Photonic Heterojunctions of Organoplatinum Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into crystalline microrods by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. CH2Cl2&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered domino transformation or patterned&#8208;mask&#8208;assisted vapor treatment transforms these microrods into multiblock polarized photonic heterojunctions with alternate yellow/red phosphorescence and orthogonal polarization directions, as a result of the vaporchromic switching of crystal packing and excited&#8208;state properties.







Abstract
Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors with different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into highly polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, the Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rods). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of the Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, the R&#8208;rod can be further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of the crystal packing and excited&#8208;state property is critical for the construction of these PPHs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Chemical Self&#8208;Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries with High Charging and Discharging Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;charging zinc ion battery system for the first time, the photo&#8208;assisted process during chemical self&#8208;charging promotes the transfer of electrons from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction, and enables it to exhibit excellent performance, providing a new strategy for zinc ion battery in energy storage.







Abstract
Chemical self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95&#8197;V within 3&#8197;hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Enantiodivergent Construction of P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Molecules via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Prochiral N&#8208;Aryl Phosphonamides with Aromatic Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules via palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis was established. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantiomers of the P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules using a single chiral norbornene catalyst.







Abstract
In this work, we describe an efficient and modular method for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules by utilizing the catalytic atroposelective Catellani&#8208;type C&#8722;H arylation/desymmetric intramolecular N&#8208;arylation cascade reaction. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was proved to be tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing a wide range of both chiral P(V)&#8208;stereogenic enantiomers in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantiomeric excesses. Noteworthy is that the strategy developed herein represents an unprecedented example of solvent&#8208;dictated inversion of the enantioselectivity of P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light&#8208;harvesting and photoenergy applications.







Abstract
Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

     alt="Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topology-directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra-framework singlet-state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light-harvesting and photoenergy applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well-defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology-directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene-porphyrin alignment along the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; directions at a 1.5-nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti-AA stack along the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra-framework singlet-to-singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet-to-triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near-infrared regions for light emitting and photo-to-chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well-defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Cu Penetration Electrode Boosts Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling for Ampere&#8208;Level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Reduction in Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
Tensile&#8208;strained copper hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (Cu HPE) enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of multicarbon (C2+) products. A faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic electrolyte (pH=1).







Abstract
The synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products remains a substantial challenge in sustainable CO2 electroreduction owing to the need for sufficient current density and faradaic efficiency alongside carbon efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate ampere&#8208;level high&#8208;efficiency CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in both neutral and strongly acidic (pH=1) electrolytes using a hierarchical Cu hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE). High concentration of K+ could concurrently suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+ production in strong acid. By optimizing the K+ and H+ concentration and CO2 flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H2SO4 and KCl (pH=1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile&#8208;strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C2+ products.

         <title>Generation of Triplet States by Host&#8208;Stabilized Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for the Construction of Efficient Supramolecular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting the generation of triplet states is essential for developing efficient photocatalytic systems. This research presents a novel approach of host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation via the combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent methods. The designed building block, 4,4'&#8208;(1,4(1,4)&#8208;dibenzene cyclohexaphane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;phenylpyridinium) chloride, features inherently stable through&#8208;space conjugation. When this block forms a 1:1 host&#8208;guest complex with cucurbit[8]uril, the through&#8208;space conjugation is further stabilized within the confined cavity. Both the generation and lifetime of triplet state are significantly increased, resulting from the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation. Additionally, the ultrahigh binding constant of 6.58 &#215; 1014 M&#8208;1 ensures the persistence of host&#8208;stabilization effect. As a result, the host&#8208;guest complex acts as a highly efficient catalyst in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. In the photodegradation of lignin, a complex natural product, the host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits high efficiency, demonstrating its robustness. This line of research is anticipated to enrich the toolbox of supramolecular photochemistry and provide a strategy for fabricating efficient supramolecular photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifting B12&#8208;Dependent Photoreceptor Protein via Optical Coupling for Inducible Living Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalamin (B12)&#8208;dependent photoreceptors are gaining traction in materials synthetic biology, especially for optically controlling cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell adhesion in living materials. However, these proteins are mostly responsive to green light, limiting their deep&#8208;tissue applications. Here, we present a general strategy for shifting photoresponse of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptor CarHC from green to red/far&#8208;red light via optical coupling. Using thiol&#8208;maleimide click chemistry, we labeled cysteine&#8208;containing CarHC mutants with SulfoCyanine5 (Cy5), a red light&#8208;capturing fluorophore. The resulting photoreceptors not only retained the ability to tetramerize in the presence of adenosylcobalamin (AdoB12), but also gained sensitivity to red light; labeled tetramers disassembled on red light exposure. Using genetically encoded click chemistry, we assembled the red&#8208;shifted proteins into hydrogels that degraded rapidly in response to red light. Furthermore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were genetically engineered to display CarHC variants, which, alongside in situ Cy5 labeling, led to living materials that could assemble and disassemble in response to AdoB12 and red light, respectively. These results illustrate the CarHC spectrally tuned by optical coupling as a versatile motif for dynamically controlling cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell interactions within engineered living materials. Given their prevalence and ecological diversity in nature, this spectral tuning method will expand the use of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptors in optogenetics and living materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cleavage of carbophosphinocarbenes and carbodicarbenes with nitrous oxide (N2O) leads to the formation of room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes. The utility of Ph3P/N2 and NHC/N2 ligand exchange reactions were demonstrated by accessing novel benzimidazole&#8208; and benzothiazole derived diazoalkenes, which are not accessible by the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. The stable diazoalkenes subsequently allow further ligand exchange reactions at C(0) with carbon monoxide, isocyanide, or a diamidocarbene (DAC). Overall, the combination of hitherto unknown NHC/N2 and N2/L (L = DAC, CO, R&#8208;NC) ligand exchange reactions at a C(0) center allow the selective functionalization of the carbodicarbene ligand structure which represents a new methodology to rapidly assemble novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sunlight has long served as primary energy source on our planet, shaping the behavior of living organisms. Extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the evolutionary pathways involved. When the formation of Earth atmosphere, it primarily consisted of small gas molecules, which are considered crucial for the emergence of life. Recent demonstrations have shown that these molecules can also be transformed into semiconductors, with the potential to harness solar energy and catalyze chemical reactions as photocatalysts. Building upon this research, this minireview focuses on the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. Initially, it examines key reactions, such as the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, various C&#8208;N complexes in photocatalysts are explored, showcasing their roles in catalyzing chemical reactions. The conclusion and outlook provide a potential pathway for the evolution of Earth, shedding light on the significance of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in development of Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries Operating Stably under &#8208;10 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide&#8208;based flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their features of high electrochemical activity, good kinetics and low material cost. However, they suffer from low energy density and poor temperature adaptability. The ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte exhibits low solubility (~0.4 M at 25 &#176;C) in NaOH&#8208; or KOH&#8208;based supporting electrolyte and can easily form precipitates below room temperature. Here we report a lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte that significantly enhances the solubility of ferrocyanide. The use of LiOH intensifies the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between water molecules and solutes and cripples polarization among ferrocyanide ions. Thus, we have achieved a ferrocyanide&#8208;based catholyte of 1.7 M at 25 &#176;C and of 0.8 M at &#8208;10 &#176;C. A zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on the lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte demonstrates a steady charge energy of ~72 Wh L&#8208;1catholyte at 25 &#176;C for ~4200 cycles (~4200 hours). Furthermore, it remains stable for ~800 cycles (~800 hours) at &#8208;10 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration and Stabilizing Crystal&#8208;Phase in Halide Perovskite via Directly Incorporated Fluoride Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity has been under intensive investigation in perovskite solar cells due to its remarkable defect suppression and greatly improvement of device performance. Nevertheless, these researches only focus on surface, grain boundaries or interface modification, the directly insertion of F&#8722; into crystal lattice of regular lead halide perovskite films is still unrevealed. Herein, F&#8722; was successfully incorporated into perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand. The strong electronegativity of F&#8722; can strongly increase the binding energy of all the ions in CsPbI2Br and inhibit their defect formations. A trace amount of F&#8722; incorporation not only enhanced the optoelectronic properties but also effectively mitigated the ion migration and phase separation simultaneously. The photovoltaic performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells were significantly improved with a champion efficiency of 17.78% (38.01%) under AM 1.5G (1000 lux indoor light). Moreover, F&#8722; can also be directly inserted into hybrid perovskite lattice and greatly stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, enabling efficient fully MA&#8208;free FAPbI3 devices with 25.10% efficiency. Our strategy sheds light on F&#8208;containing perovskites and provides a promising way to tackle ion migration and stabilize crystal&#8208;phase in halide perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>C60 Fullerene&#8208;Induced Reduction of Metal Ions: Synthesis of C60&#8208;Metal Cluster Heterostructures with High Electrocatalytic&#160;Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal clusters, due to their small dimensions, contain a high proportion of surface atoms, thus possessing a significantly improved catalytic activity compared with their bulk counterparts and nanoparticles. Defective and modified carbon supports are effective in stabilizing metal clusters, however, the synthesis of isolated metal clusters still requires multiple steps and harsh conditions. Herein, we develop a C60 fullerene&#8208;driven spontaneous metal deposition process, where C60 serves as both a reductant and an anchor, to achieve uniform metal (Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, Au and Ru) clusters without the need for any defects or functional groups on C60. Density functional theory calculations reveal that C60 possesses multiple strong metal adsorption sites, which favors stable and uniform deposition of metal atoms. In addition, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of C60, the electronic structures of metal clusters are effectively regulated, not only optimizing the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates but also accelerating the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Ru/C60&#8208;300 exhibits remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution in an alkaline condition. This study demonstrates a facile and efficient method for synthesizing effective fullerene&#8208;supported metal cluster catalysts without any pretreatment and additional reducing agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Rechargeable LiFePO4/Graphite Batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>

All&#8208;climate batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C: A wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability is proposed. The proposed electrolyte significantly alleviates the Li plating and interfacial degradation of LiFePO4 (LFP)/graphite cells at ultralow temperatures. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit an ultra&#8208;wide operating&#8208;temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability.







Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport. Here we report a wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range ester&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt. The interfacial barrier of the battery is quantitatively unraveled by employing three&#8208;electrode system and distribution of relaxation time technique. The superior role of the proposed electrolyte in preventing Li0 plating and sustaining homogeneous and stable interphases are also systematically investigated. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit rechargeability in an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability without compromising lifespan. Specially, the practical LFP/graphite pouch cells achieve 80.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 1200&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;C) and 10&#8208;min charge to 89&#8201;% (5&#8197;C) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and provide reliable power even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8722;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/In2O3&#8208;ZrO2 was found to be active for ethanol production from CO2 hydrogenation, but ethanol productivity decreased substantially after several hours of reaction due to the excessive reduction of In species. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites were stabilized, and ethanol could be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO).







Abstract
Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating photochemistry within kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) techniques, we significantly accelerated the identification of enzyme inhibitors, demonstrating the potential of KTGS for rapid discovery of bioactive ligands in medicinal chemistry. The chiral linkage gives rise to the formation of enantiomers, which were assessed via a highly stereocontrolled synthesis of both templated ligand enantiomers.







Abstract
We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraborate node has been shown to facilitate the formation of 3D ionic covalent organic frameworks with flexible linkers. Irreversible deprotonation acts as a kinetic control to achieve high polymerization, while the dynamic B&#8722;O bond aids error correction. This approach has been investigated with three organic monomers and two metal counterions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated the intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high degree of polymerization. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counterions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials have been tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.

         <title>Interception and Synthetic Application of Diradical and Diene Forms of Dual&#8208;Nature Azabicyclic o&#8208;Quinodimethanes Generated by 6&#960;&#8208;Azaelectrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Alkenylarylimines have been shown to undergo 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization thermally to generate azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes. These o&#8208;quinodimethanes show dual nature as a cyclic diene and a benzylic diradical. The interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;quinodimethanes by H&#8208;atom transfer enabled the synthesis of five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The cyclic dienes were intercepted by [4+2] cycloaddition to generate bridgehead azabicycles.







Abstract
We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4+2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is established by merging dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This transformation was triggered by XAT followed by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;HAT and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer. With this method, a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.







Abstract
Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.

         <title>Strong Enhancement in Cobalt(II)&#8208;TPMA Aqueous Hydrogen Photosynthesis through Intramolecular Proton Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of proton relays close to the catalytic metal center boosts hydrogen photosynthesis with cobalt(II) TPMA complexes leading to a 4&#8208;fold increase in quantum efficiency and up to a 22&#8208;fold gain in turnover number.







Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen generation by cobalt(II) tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complexes is mainly limited by protonation kinetics and decomposition routes involving demetallation. In the present work we have explored the effects of both proton shuttles and improved rigidity on the catalytic ability of cobalt(II) TPMA complexes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that, while a small enhancement in the catalytic performance is attained in a rigid cage structure, the introduction of ammonium groups as proton transfer relays in close proximity to the cobalt center allows to reach a 4&#8208;fold increase in the quantum efficiency of H2 formation, and a surprising 22&#8208;fold gain in the maximum turnover number, at low catalyst concentration. The beneficial role of the ammonium relays in promoting faster intramolecular proton transfer to the reduced cobalt center is documented by transient absorption spectroscopy, showcasing the great relevance of tuning the catalyst periphery to achieve efficient catalysis of solar fuel formation.

         <title>Optimizing the Microenvironment in Solid Polymer Electrolytes by Anion Vacancy Coupled with Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D flower&#8208;like SnS2 composite with abundant sulfur vacancies is synthesized under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots, and it is employed as filler to optimize the microenvironment in solid polymer electrolytes. As a result, the constructed composite electrolyte not only exhibits high room temperature ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number but also demonstrates significantly improved mechanical properties, providing solid state lithium metal batteries with excellent cycling stability and extended cycle life.







Abstract
The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li+, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li+ in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower&#8208;like SnS2&#8208;based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS2 have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li2S/Li3N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li+ diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy&#8208;rich inorganic filler modification strategy.

         <title>Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed by Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective annulation of aldehydes and ketones with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes generating chiral tetrahydrofurans is presented. For both aldehydes and ketones high yields and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained. Some intriguing mechanistic aspects are discussed, and stereoselective transformations are demonstrated.







Abstract
The substituted tetrahydrofuran core is a structural motif in many biologically active and natural compounds. However, the scarcity of enantioselective methods developed towards its synthesis makes this field challenging and attractive to explore. Herein, the first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with aldehydes and ketones affording enantioenriched 2,3,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans is reported. The reaction concept is based on activation of racemic &#946;&#8208;cyclopropyl ketones by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base which catalyzes the (3+2) annulation for a range of aldehydes and ketones. For aldehydes, the annulation furnished tetrahydrofurans in excellent yield, good diastereoselectivity and with excellent enantioselectivity up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Surprisingly, aromatic aldehydes afforded the cis&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans as the major diastereoisomer, while for aliphatic aldehydes the trans&#8208;cycloadduct was favored. The reaction also proceeds well for ketones affording spiro tetrahydrofurans in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Hammett studies have been conducted to elucidate the influence of the electronic nature of benzaldehydes on the stereoselectivity. Based on the diastereochemical outcome for the aldehydes, two reaction paths for aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes are proposed. Finally, two diastereoselective synthetic transformations have been conducted to demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Polymers Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers were synthesized by integrating chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone. The chiral polymers showed narrowband emission, high PLQY and large |glum| value. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited EQEmax of 9.8&#8201;%, |gEL| of 0.07, and FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This is the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers combining high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self&#8208;assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named R&#8208;PBN and S&#8208;PBN, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490&#8197;nm with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79&#8201;%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self&#8208;assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|glum|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.8&#8201;%, intense CPEL activities with |gEL| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.

Selenium is introduced into the halide perovskite framework, for the first time, using the zwitterionic selenocysteamine. The average and local structures of these mixed&#8208;anion perovskites help determine the band structures and potential trap states, respectively. Calculations show dispersive bands and direct gaps, which can be further tuned to straddle the ideal values for tandem solar cells using halide alloying and chalcogenide alloying.







Abstract
We incorporate Se into the 3D halide perovskite framework using the zwitterionic ligand: SeCYS (+NH3(CH2)2Se&#8722;), which occupies both the X&#8722; and A+ sites in the prototypical ABX3 perovskite. The new organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites: (SeCYS)PbX2 (X=Cl, Br) expand upon the recently discovered organosulfide&#8208;halide perovskites. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis reveal the average structures of the organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites, whereas the local lead coordination environments and their distributions were probed through solid&#8208;state 77Se and 207Pb NMR, complemented by theoretical simulations. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the band structures of (SeCYS)PbX2 largely resemble those of their S analogs, with similar band dispersion patterns, yet with a considerable band gap decrease. Optical absorbance measurements indeed show band gaps of 2.07 and 1.86&#8197;eV for (SeCYS)PbX2 with X=Cl and Br, respectively. We further demonstrate routes to alloying the halides (Cl, Br) and chalcogenides (S, Se) continuously tuning the band gap from 1.86 to 2.31&#8197;eV&#8211;straddling the ideal range for tandem solar cells or visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The comprehensive description of the average and local structures, and how they can fine&#8208;tune the band gap and potential trap states, respectively, establishes the foundation for understanding this new perovskite family, which combines solid&#8208;state and organo&#8208;main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea from CO2 and Nitrate by a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main challenge for urea electrosynthesis is to operate at both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. Here, we report a sustainable method for urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; using a novel MOF catalyst, PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, achieving high efficiency and stability, and demonstrating potential for industrial scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes. The main challenge hindering the progress of this technology lies in the development of advanced electrocatalysts that efficiently utilize abundant, low&#8208;cost CO2 and nitrogen sources to yield urea with both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. In this work, we designed and prepared a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, constructed by nickel&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) ligands and square&#8208;planar FeO4 nodes, as the electrocatalyst for urea electrosynthesis. PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O exhibits remarkable performance to yield urea at a high current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a high FE(urea) of 54.1&#8201;% in a neutral aqueous solution, surpassing those of most reported electrocatalysts. No obvious performance degradation was observed over 20&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By expanding the electrode area to 25&#8197;cm2 and operating for 8&#8197;hours, we obtained 0.164&#8197;g of high&#8208;purity urea, underscoring its potential for industrial applications. Mechanism study unveiled the enhanced performance might be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between NiPc and FeO4 sites. Specifically, NH3 produced at the FeO4 site can efficiently migrate and couple with the *NHCOOH intermediate adsorbed on the urea&#8208;producing site (NiPc). This synergistic effect results in a lower energy barrier for C&#8722;N bond formation than those of the reported catalysts with single active sites.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial enzymes that operate with pnictogen bonds or &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in general are introduced: Transfer hydrogenation of quinolines accelerates with biotinylated pnictogen&#8208;bonding cofactors and their interfacing with streptavidin and mutants, shows saturation behavior with transition&#8208;state recognition three orders of magnitude beyond substrate recognition, and the emergence of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The objective of this study was to create artificial enzymes that capitalize on pnictogen bonding, a &#963;&#8208;hole interaction that is essentially absent in biocatalysis. For this purpose, stibine catalysts were equipped with a biotin derivative and combined with streptavidin mutants to identify an efficient transfer hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a fluorogenic quinoline substrate. Increased catalytic activity from wild&#8208;type streptavidin to the best mutants coincides with the depth of the &#963; hole on the Sb(V) center, and the emergence of saturation kinetic behavior. Michaelis&#8211;Menten analysis reveals transition&#8208;state recognition in the low micromolar range, more than three orders of magnitude stronger than the millimolar substrate recognition. Carboxylates preferred by the best mutants contribute to transition&#8208;state recognition by hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairing and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with the emerging pyridinium product. The emergence of challenging stereoselectivity in aqueous systems further emphasizes compatibility of pnictogen bonding with higher order systems catalysis.

         <title>Versatile Dehydration&#8208;Assisted Functionalization of Quantum Dots and Rods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) enables rapid ligand exchange and dense surface modification of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs). This study highlights DAF's role in preparing chiral QRs, engineering QD surface charge, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF provides a versatile solution for diverse QD and QR functionalization applications.







Abstract
Functionalization of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs) with ligands is essential for their further practical application across various domains. Dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) is a versatile method applicable to a wide range of hydrophilic ligands with an affinity to the surface of QDs and QRs. This approach facilitates rapid one&#8208;pot ligand exchange and dense modification by efficiently transferring these ligands onto the surface of QDs and QRs. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DAF in preparing chiral QRs, engineering the surface charge of QDs, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating dense DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF therefore offers a versatile solution for hydrophilic ligand functionalization of QDs and QRs applicable to diverse applications.

DAF therefore offers a versatile solution for hydrophilic ligand functionalization of QDs and QRs applicable to diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting Mitochondrial Guanine Quadruplexes for Photoactivatable Chemotherapy in Hypoxic Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an oxygen independent photoactivatable chemotherapeutic, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3, that targets mitochondrial guanine quadruplexes. Photoirradiation induces depletion of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial dysfunction causing cell death by triggering apoptosis. Importantly, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 is negligibly toxic under dark conditions but upon irradiation, significant toxicity is observed.







Abstract
A first example of a mitochondrial G&#8208;quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti&#8208;G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5&#8197;J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type&#8197;II singlet oxygen and Type&#8197;III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions, from live cell assays and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Triggered H&#8208;Abstraction Photoinitiators for the Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Independent Therapy of Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer photodynamic therapy. The photoinitiator can initiate red&#8208;light&#8208;induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules to induce necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, photoinitiator was degraded following H&#8208;abstraction, avoiding the long&#8208;term phototoxicity. This study provides a crucial molecular strategy for hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by oxygen&#8208;dependence and side effects caused by photosensitizer residues. Photoinitiators based on the H&#8208;abstraction reaction can address these challenges because they can generate alkyl radical&#8208;killing cells independently of oxygen and undergo rapid bleaching following H&#8208;abstraction. Nonetheless, the development of photoinitiators for PDT has been impeded by the absence of effective design strategies. Herein, we have developed aryl&#8208;ketone substituted cyanine (ACy&#8722;R), the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer therapy. These ACy&#8722;R molecules inherited the near&#8208;infrared absorption of cyanine dye, and aryl&#8208;ketone modification imparted H&#8208;abstraction capability. Experimental and quantum calculations revealed that modifying the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of the aryl (e.g., ACy&#8208;5F) improved the contribution of the O atom to the photon excitation process promoting intersystem crossing and H&#8208;abstraction ability. Particularly, ACy&#8208;5F rapidly penetrated cells and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum. Even under severe hypoxia, ACy&#8208;5F initiated red&#8208;light induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules, inducing necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, ACy&#8208;5F was degraded after H&#8208;abstraction, thus avoiding the side effects of long&#8208;term phototoxicity after therapy. This study not only provides a crucial molecular tool for hypoxic tumors therapy, but also presents a promising strategy for the development of multifunctional photosensitizers and photoinitiators.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Lewis Acid&#8722;Base Interaction Toward para&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Aldimines and Benzylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for para selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines has been developed using iridium catalysis. While aromatic aldimines participate in a sterically controlled Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction where the in situ generated pinacolborane acts as a transient directing group (DG), interestingly the origin of the para selectivity of benzylamines stems from the sterical demand of the N&#8208;substituents.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization of arenes at the para position remains extremely challenging primarily due to its relative inaccessibility from the catalytic site. As a consequence, it is significantly restricted to limited molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report a method for the para&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines using commercially available ligands under iridium catalysis. The established method displays excellent para selectivity for variously substituted aromatic aldimines, benzylamines and bioactive molecules. Based on several control experiments, it is proposed that a Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction between the nitrogen and boron functionality guides the para selectivity via a steric shield for the aromatic aldimines, where Bpin acts as a transient directing group. However, the steric shield of the in situ generated N&#8722;Bpin moiety controlled the overall selectivity for the para borylation of benzylamines.

         <title>Development of a Fluorescent Probe with High Selectivity based on Thiol&#8208;ene Click Nucleophilic Cascade Reactions for Delving into the Action Mechanism of Serotonin in Depression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to achieve rapid and accurate detection of serotonin in organisms is a key question in studying the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as depression. To study the action mechanism of serotonin, we have developed a highly selective molecular probe based on thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions that enables real&#8208;time imaging of brain tissues in depression.







Abstract
The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe SJ&#8208;5&#8208;HT for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.

However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3-mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol-ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe &lt;b&gt;SJ-5-HT&lt;/b&gt; for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 Nanorods for Efficient and pH&#8208;universal Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Te&#8722;Bi NRs were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. The obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate with high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to generate chemical fuels such as formate presents a promising route to a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its practical application is hindered by the competing CO production and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as the lack of pH&#8208;universal catalysts. Here, Te&#8208;modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8722;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11 NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus&#8208;obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline). In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3&#8201;%, 96.4&#8201;%, and 91.0&#8201;%, respectively, at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron&#8208;deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate, and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

         <title>Customized Photoelectrochemical C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P Bond Formation Enabled by Tailored Deposition on Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With customized designs of the deposition layer on the BiVO4 photoanode, two PEC systems were developed for highly efficient catalytic C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. The modified BiVO4@Al2O3 demonstrated substantial performances for important yet challenging coupling between amides and xanthenes under aerobic conditions, whereas BiVO4@Ni1Co7Pi manifested its versatility in C&#8722;P coupling between aryl bromides and diphenylphosphine oxide, facilitated by a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycle under ultralow potentials.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is burgeoning as an innovative solution to organic synthesis. However, the current PEC systems suffer from limited reaction types and unsatisfactory performances. Herein, we employ efficient BiVO4 photoanodes with tailored deposition layers for customizing two PEC approaches toward C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. Our process proceeds under mild reaction conditions, deploying easily available substrates and ultra&#8208;low potentials. Beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, customized PEC offers high efficiency, good functional group tolerance, and substantial applicability for decorating drug molecules, highlighting its promising potential to enrich the synthetic toolbox for broader organic chemistry of practical applications.

         <title>Subsurface Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Enabled by Mechanochemical Synthesis for Oxidation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical approach has been shown to be an effective method of regulating the position of single atoms. Controlling single atoms at the surface or subsurface results in catalysts with very different adsorption properties, leading to different reaction mechanisms. As a result, the subsurface Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst shifts the conversion profile 80&#8197;K towards the low&#8208;temperature region and NH3 is completely converted at 513&#8197;K.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional atom utilization and unique properties. However, the practical application of these catalysts is often impeded by challenges such as sintering&#8208;induced instability and poisoning of isolated atoms due to strong gas adsorption. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical method to insert single Cu atoms into the subsurface of Fe2O3 support. By manipulating the location of single atoms at the surface or subsurface, catalysts with distinct adsorption properties and reaction mechanisms can be achieved. It was observed that the subsurface Cu single atoms in Fe2O3 remained isolated under both oxidation and reduction environments, whereas surface Cu single atoms on Fe2O3 experienced sintering under reduction conditions. The unique properties of these subsurface single&#8208;atom catalysts call for innovations and new understandings in catalyst design.

         <title>Dual Channel Emissions of Kasha and Anti&#8208;Kasha from a Single Radical Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable mono&#8208;radical counterpart of the chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabins's hydrocarbon displays dual&#8208;channel emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. This coexistence of two types of luminescence is observed for the first time in the field of luminescent radicals.







Abstract
Stable open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals have recently attracted much attention due to their unique luminescence properties. However, a radical molecule with both Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha doublet emission properties has not been reported. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a stable chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabin's hydrocarbon, TTM&#8208;TTM, along with its mono&#8208;radical counterpart, TTM&#8208;HTTM. The emission of TTM&#8208;TTM follows Kasha's rule in the near infrared region. However, TTM&#8208;HTTM shows dual channel doublet emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. Remarkably, these two types of emission compete dynamically in both solution and condensed states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the rational design and discovery of stable radicals that possess distinctive luminescent properties, thus broadening the horizons of luminescent materials research.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

&lt;p&gt;Long-chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in-chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Porous Liquids to Perform Liquid&#8208;Liquid Separations</title>

         <dc:description>
A schematic of monoethylene glycol (MEG) adsorption measurements using a permeable membrane and a Type&#8197;3 porous liquid showing selective adsorption due to inclusion into the pores of the dispersed porous solid.







Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) are a new type of fluid sorbent investigated mainly for the separation of gas mixtures. Here, we explore their application to the separation of miscible liquids, using MEG/water (MEG=monoethylene glycol) and EtOH/water as proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle. Recovery of used MEG is industrially important but its extraction into conventional solvents from water is difficult. PLs ZIF&#8208;8@PDMS (PL1, PDMS=polydimethylsilicone) or ZIF&#8208;8@sesame oil (PL2) each consisting of 25&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the hydrophobic microporous material ZIF&#8208;8 dispersed in PDMS or sesame oil respectively, were formulated and found to be exceedingly physically stable to sedimentation. A 5&#8197;nm PEEK membrane was used to provide a permeable barrier between the PL and the alcohol/water phase. MEG was selectively extracted through the membrane from approximately 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;wt&#8201;% MEG/water mixtures into the PL phase and this procedure could be applied repeatedly. It was effective for MEG/water mixtures as dilute as 3&#8201;:&#8201;97&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The PL could also be regenerated (80&#8201;&#176;C at 0.01&#8197;bar) and re&#8208;used, suggesting its potential for continuous, cyclic extraction. Furthermore, PL3 (silicalite&#8208;1@PDMS) was effective in selective alcohol extraction from beverages. It shows potential for lowering the alcohol concentration in gin or wine due to its excellent chemical stability and nontoxicity. Overall, we show that the enhanced adsorption properties of PLs due the presence of empty pores,&#160;which provides unusually high gas solubilities, also makes them, in principle, applicable to liquid&#8208;liquid separations.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.

         <title>Dihydropyridopyrazine Functionalized Xanthene: Generating Stable NIR Dyes with Small&#8208;Molecular Weight by Enhanced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a modular structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. Owing to its great charge separation feature, the dihydropyridopyrazine significantly enhanced the internal charge transfer states of traditional fluorophores, resulting in greatly redshifted wavelengths of the reconstructed dyes together with a small molecular weight increase, retained stability and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared region (NIR; 650&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyes offer many advantages over traditional dyes with absorption and emission in the visible region. However, developing new NIR dyes, especially organic dyes with long wavelengths, small molecular weight, and excellent stability and biocompatibility, is still quite challenging. Herein, we present a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a charge separation structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. These novel NIR dyes not only exhibited greatly redshifted wavelengths compared to their parent dyes, but also displayed a small molecular weight increase together with retained stability and biocompatibility. Specifically, dye NIR&#8208;OX, a dihydropyridopyra&#8208;zine derivative of oxazine with a molecular mass of 386.2&#8197;Da, exhibited an absorption at 822&#8197;nm and an emission extending to 1200&#8197;nm, making it one of the smallest molecular&#8208;weight NIR&#8208;II emitting dyes. Thanks to its rapid metabolism and long wave&#8208;length, NIR&#8208;OX enabled high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and assessment of cholestatic liver injury in vivo and also facilitated the evalua&#8208;tion of the efficacy of liver protection medicines against cholestatic liver injury.

         <title>Outstanding Superoxide Dismutase Catalytic Activity Of Simple Peptide&#8208;Based Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be positive! A novel Ni superoxide dismutase mimic was engineered, taking advantage of the versatility of the Amino Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) motif to introduce positive charges around the NiII center. This strategy yielded the most potent synthetic NiSOD mimic reported to date, in terms of catalytic efficacy and stability.







Abstract
We present here the most active synthetic Ni superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) mimic reported to date. Reactive oxygen species are aggressive compounds, which concentrations are tightly regulated in vivo. Among them, the superoxide anion, O2&#8901;&#8722;, is controlled by superoxide dismutases. Capitalizing on the versatility of the Amino&#8208;Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) peptide motif, we introduced positive charges around the NiII center to favor the interaction with the superoxide radical anion. At physiological pH, the pentapeptide H&#8722;Cys&#8722;His&#8722;Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Arg&#8722;NH2 coordinates NiII after the deprotonation of one thiol, two amides, and either the second thiol or the N&#8208;terminal ammonium, leading to an equilibrium between the two N3S1 and N2S2 coordination modes. Under catalytic conditions, a kcat value of 8.6(4)&#215;106&#8197;L.mol&#8722;1.s&#8722;1 was measured. Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O2&#8901;&#8722; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C&#8208;terminus to increase the global charge of the NiII complex from +1 to +2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.

         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Formation Cycling Enabling LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a novel additive&#8208;free strategy to create LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) through low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Achieving superior battery performance across a wide temperature range, this approach is applicable to various cathode systems, highlighting its versatility and potential for advancing battery technology.







Abstract
Formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase is highly desirable for wide&#8208;temperature battery, but its application is hindered by the unwanted side reactions associated with conventional method of introducing fluorinated additives. Here, we developed an additive&#8208;free strategy to produce LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) by low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Using LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 as a model cathode, the atomic ratio of LiF in the CEI formed at &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C is about 17.7&#8201;%, enhanced by ~550&#8201;% compared to CEI formed at 25&#8201;&#176;C (2.7&#8201;%). The underlying mechanism is uncovered by both experiments and theoretic simulation, indicating that the decomposition of LiPF6 to LiF is transformed into spontaneous and exothermic on positively charged cathode surface and lowering the temperature shift chemical equilibrium towards the formation of LiF&#8208;rich CEI. Superior to conventional fluorinated additives, this approach is free from unwanted side reactions, imparting batteries with both high&#8208;temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) cyclability and low&#8208;temperature rate performance (capacity enhanced by 100&#8201;% at 3&#8197;C at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). This low&#8208;temperature formation cycling to construct LiF&#8208;rich CEI is extended to various cathode systems, such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, demonstrating the versatility and potential impact of our strategy in advancing the performance and stability of wide&#8208;temperature batteries and beyond.

         <title>Designed Synthesis of an Aluminum Molecular Ring Based Rotaxane and Polyrotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multisite and adaptive Al8 macrocycle demonstrates a groundbreaking capacity to sequentially encapsulate molecules, complexes, and polymers through &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; interactions. This progressive encapsulation culminates in the formation of an endless polyrotaxane structure, &#8220;the Al8 rock sugar gourd&#8221;. These distinct host&#8211;guest interactions bestow the Al8 macrocycles with customizable optical&#8208;limiting functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.

         <title>Lantern&#8208;Shaped Structure Induced by Racemic Ligands in Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Metal Halide with Near 100% Quantum Yield and Multiple&#8208;Stimulus Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their excellent luminescent properties and tunable emission wavelengths. However, the development of efficient red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting OIMHs remains a significant challenge. This work reports three Mn&#8208;based OIMHs derived from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrobromide: racemic one (Rac&#8208;TBM) and chiral ones (R&#8208;TBM and S&#8208;TBM). As a result of the synergism of chiral organic ligands inducing a unique lantern&#8208;shaped hybrid structure containing both tetrahedra and octahedra, Rac&#8208;TBM exhibits red&#8208;light emission with near&#8208;unity luminescence quantum yield. In comparison, the chiral counterparts R/S&#8208;TBM display strong green emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum value up to &#177; 2.5 &#215; 10&#8208;2. Interestingly, a mixture of R&#8208; and S&#8208;TBM can transform into Rac&#8208;TBM, successfully achieving a sensitive and reversible switch between red light of octahedra and green light of tetrahedra under external stimuli. The outstanding luminescent properties allow Rac&#8208;TBM to be utilized not only for X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a detection limit down to 46.29 nGys&#8208;1, but also for advanced information encryption systems to achieve leak&#8208;proof decryption.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic-inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their excellent luminescent properties and tunable emission wavelengths. However, the development of efficient red-light-emitting OIMHs remains a significant challenge. This work reports three Mn-based OIMHs derived from 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrobromide: racemic one (Rac-TBM) and chiral ones (R-TBM and S-TBM). As a result of the synergism of chiral organic ligands inducing a unique lantern-shaped hybrid structure containing both tetrahedra and octahedra, Rac-TBM exhibits red-light emission with near-unity luminescence quantum yield. In comparison, the chiral counterparts R/S-TBM display strong green emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum value up to &#177; 2.5 &#215; 10-2. Interestingly, a mixture of R- and S-TBM can transform into Rac-TBM, successfully achieving a sensitive and reversible switch between red light of octahedra and green light of tetrahedra under external stimuli. The outstanding luminescent properties allow Rac-TBM to be utilized not only for X-ray radioluminescence with a detection limit down to 46.29 nGys-1, but also for advanced information encryption systems to achieve leak-proof decryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isomeric&#160;Dimer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells with over 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategy of isomerization is known for its simple yet effective role in optimizing molecular configuration and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the impact of isomerization on the design of dimer acceptors has been rarely investigated, and the relationship between the chemical structure and optoelectronic property remains unclear. In this study, we designed and synthesized two dimer acceptor isomers named D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. Compared to D&#8208;TN, D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced backbone planarity, elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, and more ordered molecular stacking. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6:D&#8208;TPh achieved a PCE of 19.05%, higher than that (PCE = 18.42%) of the device based on PM6:D&#8208;TN. Large&#8208;area PM6:D&#8208;TPh devices (1 cm&#178;) yielded a PCE of 18.0%. More importantly, the extrapolated T80 lifetime of the PM6:D&#8208;TPh device is over 2800 h with MPP tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. These results suggest that isomerization strategy is an effective way to optimize the molecular configuration of dimer acceptors for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, mild, and transition metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides was developed through Si&#8211;F bond activation.&#160;&#160;Although the Si&#8211;F bond is one of the strongest bonds, Si&#8211;C bond formation via Si&#8211;F bond cleavage with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids has been successfully achieved.&#160;&#160;This unprecedented strategy provides a facile approach for synthesizing&#160;ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates.&#160;&#160;Notably, this method allows the use of not only dialkylarylsilyl fluorides and diarylalkylsilyl fluorides but also triarylsilyl fluorides as coupling partners, which is uncommon in the field of arylsilane synthesis.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, a variety of&#160;ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced in moderate to good yields with broad functional group tolerance.&#160;&#160;Additionally, the versatility of&#160;ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates was demonstrated by the elaboration of the products into a range of silicon&#8208;containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Solid Polymer Electrolytes Enabling an Ultra&#8208;Stable Interface with Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are crucial in the development of lithium metal batteries. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMSs) have shown promise as solid fillers to improve the performance of SPEs. However, the number of OMS&#8208;containing MOFs is quite limited, comprising less than 5% of the total MOFs. When considering yield, cost, and processability, the commonly used OMS&#8208;containing MOFs are no more than 10 types, causing great limitations. Herein, we reported a simple and universal methodology that converted OMS&#8208;free MOFs to OMS&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;MOFs for developing high&#8208;performance SPEs, and explored the underlying mechanism. The &#8220;OMS&#8208;polymer&#8221; and &#8220;OMS&#8208;ion&#8221; interactions were investigated in detail to elucidate the role of quasi&#8208;MOFs on battery performance. It was found that quasi&#8208;MOFs, functioning as ion sieves, can effectively regulate ion migration, thus promoting uniform Li deposition and enabling an ultra&#8208;stable interface. As a result, the Li symmetric cell stably ran over 3000 h at 0.3 mA cm&#8208;2, while the full cell retained 85% of its initial capacity after 1500 cycles at 1.0 C. Finally, universal testing was performed using other MOFs, confirming the generalizability and effectiveness of our design concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenylthiol) with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5 nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibits higher catalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity is well interpreted using density functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, highlighting the influence of GBs and point defects on the properties of metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Helmholtz Plane Regulation Empowers PF6&#8722; Permselectivity towards High Coulombic Efficiency Dual Ion Battery of 5.5 V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) is promising for stationary energy storage applications owing to its cost&#8208;effectiveness, which has been a hot topic of research in rechargeable battery fields. However, it still suffers from rapid battery failure caused by the severe solvent co&#8208;intercalation and electrolyte oxidation. To address these bottlenecks, herein a functional electrolyte additive hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) is presented based on a Helmholtz plane regulation strategy. It is demonstrated that the HFGA can precisely enter into the Helmholtz plane and positively regulate anion solvation behaviors near the graphite electrode surface owing to its considerable H&#8208;F affinity with ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), thus alleviating EMC&#8208;related co&#8208;intercalation and oxidation decomposition during DIB charging. Meanwhile, HFGA can copolymerize with the presence of PF5 at the Helmholtz plane to participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity, conducive to achieving PF6&#8722; de&#8208;solvation and simultaneously suppressing electrolyte oxidation decomposition. By virtue of such beneficial effects, the graphite cathode enables a 5.5 V DIB with a prominent capacity retention of 92% and a high average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% within 2000 cycles, demonstrating significantly enhanced electrochemical reversibility. The Helmholtz plane regulation strategy marks a milestone in advancing DIB technologies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-voltage dual ion battery (DIB) is promising for stationary energy storage applications owing to its cost-effectiveness, which has been a hot topic of research in rechargeable battery fields. However, it still suffers from rapid battery failure caused by the severe solvent co-intercalation and electrolyte oxidation. To address these bottlenecks, herein a functional electrolyte additive hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) is presented based on a Helmholtz plane regulation strategy. It is demonstrated that the HFGA can precisely enter into the Helmholtz plane and positively regulate anion solvation behaviors near the graphite electrode surface owing to its considerable H-F affinity with ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), thus alleviating EMC-related co-intercalation and oxidation decomposition during DIB charging. Meanwhile, HFGA can copolymerize with the presence of PF5 at the Helmholtz plane to participate in forming a CF2-rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity, conducive to achieving PF6&#8722; de-solvation and simultaneously suppressing electrolyte oxidation decomposition. By virtue of such beneficial effects, the graphite cathode enables a 5.5 V DIB with a prominent capacity retention of 92% and a high average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% within 2000 cycles, demonstrating significantly enhanced electrochemical reversibility.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Light&#8208;Harvesting Solar Thermal Electrocatalyst Boosts Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near&#8208;complete 98% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240 mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high&#8208;efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi&#8208;carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light&#8208;trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature&#8208;induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential&#8208;limiting O* to OOH* step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8211;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum| ~ 1&#215;10&#8211;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77 K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8211;2&#160; and the maximum EQE of 6.15%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating charge transfer (CT) interactions between donor and acceptor molecules may give rise to unique dynamic changes in physicochemical properties, exhibiting great importance in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, we demonstrate the first instance of reversible photomodulation of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) CT interaction in the solid state.Pyridinium&#8208;based chromophore featuring &#960;&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;A structures can not only function as a good electron acceptor to undergo photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or engage in intermolecular CT interaction, but also exhibit unique dual emission depending on the excitation wavelengths. The rotatable C&#8208;C single bonds within D&#8208;A pairs enhance the tunability of molecular structure.&#160;Through the synergy of a photoinduced ET and an excited&#8208;state conformational change, the intermolecular CT interaction can be switched on and off by alternate light irradiation to enables reversibly modulation of the affinity between donor and acceptor molecules, accompanied by visual color switching and fluorescence on&#8208;off as feedback signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Stable Palladium Hydride Nanoclusters Anchored on Tungsten Carbides Mediate Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis holds great promise for green hydrogen production, but suffering from high loading of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGM) for large&#8208;scale deployment. Anchoring PGM&#8208;based materials on supports can not only improve the atomic utilization of active sites but also enhance the intrinsic activity. However, in practical PEM electrolysis, it is still challenging to mediate hydrogen adsorption/desorption pathways with high coverage of hydrogen intermediates over catalyst surface. Here, operando generated stable palladium (Pd) hydride nanoclusters anchored on tungsten carbide (WCx) supports were constructed for hydrogen evolution in PEM electrolysis. Under PEM operando conditions, hydrogen intercalation induces formation of Pd hydrides (PdHx) featuring weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE), thus triggering reverse hydrogen spillover from WCx (strong HBE) supports to PdHx sites, which have been evidenced by operando characterizations, electrochemical results and theoretical studies. This PdHx&#8208;WCx material can be directly utilized as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022 mg cm&#8208;2, delivering the current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at the cell voltage of ~1.66 V and continuously running for 200 hours without obvious degradation. This innovative strategy via tuning the operando characteristics to mediate reverse hydrogen spillover provide new insights for designing high&#8208;performance supported PGM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integration of living cells with extrinsic functional entities gives rise to bioaugmented nanobiohybrids, which hold tremendous potential across diverse fields such as cell therapy, biocatalysis, and cell robotics. This study presents a biocompatible method for incorporating multilayered functional liposomes onto the cell surface, creating extracellular artificial organelles. The introduction of various extrinsic functionalities to cells is achieved without comprising their viabilities. The integration of extrinsic enzymatic reactions is exemplified through the cascade reaction involving glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, our protocol offers the design flexibility to customize liposome compositions, thereby providing effective cell modification. The versatility of the liposome&#8208;based exorganelle approach establishes an advanced chemical tool, empowering cells with novel functionalities that surpass or are complementary to their innate capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Synergistic Interplay between Atomic&#8208;scale Vacancies and Ligand Effect to Optimize the Oxygen Reduction Activity and Tolerance Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect engineering is an effective strategy for regulating the electrocatalysis of nanomaterials, yet it is seldom considered for modulating Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we designed Ni&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG) with a low Pt loading of 3.5 wt.% and a Ni/Pt ratio of 0.038:1. Physical characterizations confirmed the presence of abundant atomic&#8208;scale vacancies in the Pt NPs induces long&#8208;range lattice distortions, and the Ni dopant generates a ligand effect resulting in electronic transfer from Ni to Pt. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicated that atomic&#8208;scale vacancies mainly contributed the tolerance performances towards CO and CH3OH, the ligand effect derived from a tiny of Ni dopant accelerated the transformation from *O to *OH species, thereby improved the ORR activity without compromising the tolerance capabilities. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay between atomic&#8208;scale vacancies and ligand effect, as&#8208;prepared Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG exhibited improved ORR activity, sufficient tolerance capabilities, and excellent durability. This study offers a new avenue for modulating the electrocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;based nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Reviving Multivalent&#8208;metal Anodes in Simple Salt Electrolytes via Component Modifier Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using combinatory electrolyte blends represents an imperative avenue to achieve good magnesium (Mg)&#8208;metal anode compatibility and commercial feasibility in fields of promising rechargeable Mg batteries. However, fundamental challenges of how to manipulate component modifier reactivity on molecule level still remain to be solved. Here, molecular structure design concepts towards seeking bromophenyl complex&#8208;based component modifiers has been proposed according to implications of electron&#8208;donating and/or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on Br&#8208;C bond dissociation reactivity. Exceptional Mg electro&#8208;plating/stripping properties (a stable cycle life of 250 days in Mg//Cu asymmetric cells) have been firstly achieved in a simple salt electrolyte with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylmethanamine (BPDMA) as optimal component modifier. Comprehensive analyses disclose the unique electrochemically&#8208;active Br&#8208;containing ion&#8208;pairs formation, such as [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)Br&#8722;]2+ and [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)(Br&#8722;)(G2)2]2+, which results in the much thinner Br&#8722; containing and organic&#8208;inorganic mixed interphases on Mg&#8208;metal anodes. Furthermore, conventional MgSO4&#8208;based electrolytes and even calcium (Ca)&#8208;ion electrolytes can also be revived by similar strategy, demonstrating its generality and superiority.</dc:description>

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Disordering RuO2 Catalyst for Highly Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO2 by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO2 catalyst with long&#8208;range disorder (LD&#8208;B/RuO2). The structure of long&#8208;range disorder endowed LD&#8208;B/RuO2 with a low overpotential of 175 mV and an ultra&#8208;long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6 months at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD&#8208;B/RuO2 as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.63 V with durability exceeding 300 h at 250 mA cm&#8722;2 current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long&#8208;range disordered structure and symmetry&#8208;breaking B&#8208;Ru&#8208;O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long&#8208;term stability of LD&#8208;B/RuO2. This study provides a strategy to prepare long&#8208;range disordered RuO2 acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B&#8208;doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non&#8208;iridium&#8208;based PEMWE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic C&#8208;H oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective C&#8208;H activation on complex biological macromolecules is a key goal in the field of organic chemistry. It requires thermodynamically challenging chemical transformations to be delivered in mild, aqueous conditions. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC) is a fundamentally important epigenetic modification in DNA that has major implications for biology and has emerged as a vital biomarker. Selective functionalisation of 5mC would enable new chemical approaches to tag, detect and map DNA methylation to enhance the study and exploitation of this epigenetic feature. We demonstrate the first example of direct and selective chemical oxidation of 5mC to 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) in DNA, employing a photocatalytic system. This transformation was used to selectively tag 5mC. We also provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for deploying this chemistry for single&#8208;base resolution sequencing of 5mC and genetic bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) in DNA on a next&#8208;generation sequencing system. This work exemplifies how photocatalysis has the potential to transform the analysis of DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the anion effect on steerable production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3&#65288;74.0 mol%&#65289;&gt; AlCl3 (60.8 mol%) &gt; Al2(SO4)3 (35.2 mol%) &gt; Al(NO3)3 (14.9 mol%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have prepared a series of bis(semiquinone) compounds with dithiophene bridges of different length that evolve from closed&#8208;shell to full diradical character on the basis of the narrow singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps which allows the triplet population at 298 K for the longer compound.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Induces Halogen/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (XAT/HAT) for Allylic C&#8208;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic C&#8211;H amination has emerged as a powerful tool to construct allylamines, common motifs in molecular therapeutics. Such reaction implies an oxidative path for C&#8208;H activation but furnishes reductive amines, inferring mild oxidants&#8217; inactivity for C&#8208;H oxidation but strong oxidants&#8217; detriment to products. Herein we report a heterogeneous catalytic approach that manipulates halogen&#8208;vacancies of perovskite photocatalyst and exploits halogenated&#8208;solvents (i.e. CH2Cl2, CH2Br2) as mild oxidants for selective C&#8208;H allyl amination with 19,376 turnover. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals induce cooperative hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT, C&#8208;H oxidation, and halogen&#8208;vacancy CsPbBr3&#8208;x formation) and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (XAT, CsPbBr3&#8208;x&#8208;induced solvent reduction) under a radical chain mechanism. Terminal/internal olefins are amenable to forge aromatic/aliphatic, cyclic/acyclic, secondary/tertiary allylamines (70 examples), including drugs or their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytic regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes through regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3&#8208;dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98% yield, &gt;98:2 regioselectivity, &gt;98:2 dr and 98:2 er. Application of this method to construction of axial stereogenicity and deuterated stereogenic center provided a wide range of multifunctional chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access. DFT calculations revealed the origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity as well as a unique oxidative cyclization mechanism for cobalt catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Polymer Membrane with High Stability and Enhanced Ion&#8208;Sieving Effect for Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting membranes with continuous sub&#8208;nanometer channels holds fundamental importance for flow batteries in achieving safe integration of renewable energy into grids. Self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer (COP) membranes provide feasibility due to their rapid and selective ion transport. However, the development of a scale&#8208;up possible, mechanically robust and chemically stable membranes remains a significant challenge. Herein, using irreversible strong secondary amine linkage, we propose a self&#8208;standing COP membrane with sub&#8208;nanometer pores ranging from 4.5 to 6.4 &#197;, by a simple and efficient in&#8208;situ polymerization approach. This membrane exhibits enhanced selectivity for proton and vanadium ions, especially excellent electrochemical stability, delivering an energy efficiency of over 80% at the current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1000 cycles for an all&#8208;vanadium redox flow battery (VFB). This study provides novel insights for COP&#8208;based ion&#8208;sieving membranes in sustainable energy fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Ionized Interfacial Water&#8208;Induced Localized H* Enrichment for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a process that requires the participation of eight electrons and nine protons. The regulation of active hydrogen (H*) supply and a deep understanding of related processes are necessary for improving the ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we synthesized a series of atomically precise copper&#8208;halide clusters Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X = Cl, Br, I), among which the Cu2Cl2(BINAP)2 cluster shows the optimal ammonia FE of 94.0% and an ammonia yield rate of 373 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that halogen atoms, especially Cl in Cu2Cl2(BIANP)2, can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia. This work explains the role of H* in the hydrogenation process of NO3RR and the importance of localized H* enrichment strategy for improving the FEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotides for Exploration of Cellular Protein ADP&#8208;Ribosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) greatly enhance the functional diversity of proteins, surpassing the number of gene&#8208;encoded variations. One intriguing PTM is ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate and is essential in cell signaling pathways regulating cellular responses. Here, we report the first cell&#8208;permeable NAD+ analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP&#8208;ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host&#8208;virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylome studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Abiotic foldamer quaternary structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.</dc:description>

These results represent important steps in the design of protein-like abiotic architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Gallium Intermetallic Compounds with Tailored Active Site Configurations for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs, including Co&#8208;Ga, Ni&#8208;Ga, Pt&#8208;Ga, Pd&#8208;Ga, and Rh&#8208;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O&#8208;CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8208; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Asymmetrical Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se Bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 Boosting Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalytic Performance for Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here&#160;Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC catalysts with high performance were&#160;fabricated for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 crystal phase, and the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe2O(SeO3)2 in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC had a higher d&#8208;band center of Fe atom and a lower p&#8208;orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe2O3, which leads to Fe site of Fe2O(SeO3)2 being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe2O3/Fe3C@NC, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC showed obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V for ORR in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345 mV for OER at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen reduction reaction coupled electro&#8208;oxidation for highly&#8208;efficient and sustainable water treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electro&#8208;oxidation (EO) technology demonstrates significant potential in wastewater treatment. However, the high energy consumption has become a pivotal constraint hindering its large&#8208;scale implementation. Herein, we design an EO and 4&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction coupled system (EO&#8208;4eORR) to replace the traditional EO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coupled system (EO&#8208;HER). The theoretical cathodic potential of the electrolytic reactor is tuned from 0 V (vs. RHE) in HER to 1.23 V (vs. RHE) in 4eORR, which greatly decreases the required operation voltage of the reactor. Moreover, we demonstrate that convection can improve the mass transfer of oxygen and organic pollutants in the reaction system, leading to low cathodic polarization and high pollutant removal rate. Compared with traditional EO&#8208;HER system, the energy consumption of the EO&#8208;4eORR system under air aeration for 95% total organic carbon (TOC) removal is greatly decreased to 2.61 kWh/kgTOC (only consider the electrolyzer energy consumption), which is superior to previously reported EO&#8208;based water treatment systems. The reported results in this study offer a new technical mode for development of highly efficient and sustainable EO&#8208;based treatment systems to remove organic pollutants in waste water.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Twist&#8208;induced Endocytotic Membrane Fission using Anisotropic Gold Homodimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane fission involves a crucial step of lipid remodeling, in which the dynamin collar constricts and severs the tubulated lipid membrane at the neck of budding vesicles. Nevertheless, the difficulty in accurately determining the rotational dynamics of live endocytotic vesicles poses a limit on the elucidation of dynamin&#8208;induced membrane remodeling for endocytotic vesicle scission. Herein, we designed a DNA&#8208;modified gold homodimer (AuHD)&#8208;based anisotropic plasmonic probe with uniform surface chemistry, minimizing orientational fluctuation within vesicle encapsulation. Using AuHDs as cargos to image the dynamics of cargo&#8208;containing vesicles during endocytosis, we showed that, prior to detachment from plasma membrane, the cargo&#8208;containing vesicles underwent multiple intermittent twists of ~4&#176; angular orientation relative to plasma membrane with a ~0.2 s dwell time. These findings suggest that the membrane torques resulting from dynamin actions in vivo constitute the pathway to membrane fission, potentially shedding light on how dynamin&#8208;mediated lipid remodeling orchestrates membrane fission.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Spin of Atomic Manganese Center for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising non&#8208;precious catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, the ORR SACs usually suffer from unsatisfactory activity and in particular poor stability. Herein, we report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.1 M KOH. Introducing sulfur (S) to form Mn&#8208;S coordination changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, which effectively optimizes the oxygen intermediates adsorption over the single Mn atomic sites and thus greatly improves the ORR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Metal Recovery from Sea Water by a Flexible and Scalable Membrane with Lithium&#8208;Ion Exclusive Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sea water is abundant in lithium reserves, and extracting lithium metal from it holds the potential to not only mitigate the shortage of lithium in light of the fast&#8208;growing electric vehicle industry, but also serve as an anode electrode to provide electricity. The task, however, is challenging due to the harsh reactions and low lithium concentration in sea water. Here, we present a single&#8208;channel strategy based on a flexible and scalable lithium ion&#8208;sieve membrane for efficient lithium extraction. Our composite membrane exhibits high separation factor &#946;Li/Na of more than 2.87 &#215; 107 with an ionic conductivity of 6.2&#215;10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1. Lithium metal was electrolytically extracted from sea water through a hybrid&#8208;electrolyte system, which yielded a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.04% and a low energy consumption of 17.4 kWh kgLi&#8208;1 at an optimized extracting current of 200 &#956;A cm&#8208;2. The extracted lithium metal can be directly integrated into a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, delivering an energy output of 395 Wh kg&#8208;1. To demonstrate its industrial viability, we also fabricate a pouch cell with Li metal anode extracted by an amplified extraction prototype. This study has the potential to dispel concerns of lithium depletion and facilitate the sustainable development of lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phosphonate&#8208;Organic Network as Ion Enrichment Layer for Sustainable Zinc Metal Electrode with High Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc (Zn) metal batteries could be the technology of choice for sustainable battery chemistries owing to its better safety and cost advantage. However, their cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE) are strongly limited by the dendritic growth and side reactions of Zn anodes. Herein, we proposed an in situ construction of a metal&#8722;phosphonate&#8722;organic network (MPON) with three&#8722;dimensional interconnected networks on Zn metal, which can act as an ion enrichment layer for Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;metal batteries. This MPON with abundant porous structure and phosphate sites possesses ion enriching properties and high Zn2+ transference number (0.83), which is beneficial for enhancing Zn2+ migration and self&#8722;concentrating kinetics. Meanwhile, MPON offers hydrophobicity to effectively inhibit the water&#8722;induced Zn anode corrosion. As a result, the Zn electrode exhibits superior Zn/Zn2+ reversibility of over 4 months at 3 mA cm&#8722;2 and a high CE of 99.6%. Moreover, the Zn/NaV3O8 &#183;1.5H2O and Zn/MnO2 full cells using ultrathin Zn anodes (10 &#956;m) exhibit high&#8722;capacity retention of 81% and 78% after 1400 and 1000 cycles, respectively. This work provides a unique promise to design high&#8722;performance anode for practical Zn&#8722;metal&#8722;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Synthesis of Allylic Sulfenamides from Vinyl &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds by a Rearrangement Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric rearrangement of allylic sulfilimines is an effective route to synthetic attractive targets such as allylic sulfenamides and others. The current methods are limited to chirality transfer from chiral allylic sulfilimine precursors. Herein, we report a general and fundamentally new rearrangement route accessing optically enriched allylic sulfenamides and their derivatives. The process involves a S&#8208;alkylation and an unusual S&#8208;to&#8208;N rearrangement step. The chiral nickel complex enables the transformation of a broad scope of sulfenamides and vinyl &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides under mild conditions. Various allylic sulfenamides have been synthesized with excellent &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, which can be efficiently converted to sulfinamide and 4&#8208;aminobutenoic acid derivatives. In addition, DFT calculations demonstrate the connection between the spin state and conformation of nickel vinyl carbenoid, as well as an unknown rearrangement process.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Stable Helical Structures with Enhanced Molecular Conductance by Strengthening Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing long&#8208;chain molecules with stable helical structures is of significant importance for understanding and modulating the properties and functions of helical biological macromolecules, but challenging. In this work, an effective and facile approach to stabilize folded helical structures by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation is proposed, using new ortho&#8208;hexaphenylene (o&#8208;HP) derivatives as models. The structure&#8208;activity relationship between the through&#8208;space conjugation and charge transport behavior of the prepared folded helical o&#8208;HP derivatives is experimentally and theoretically investigated. It is demonstrated that the through&#8208;space conjugation within o&#8208;HP derivatives can be strengthened by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridine and pyrazine, which can effectively stabilize the helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives. Moreover, scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;break junction measurements reveal that the stable regular helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives open up dominant through&#8208;space charge transport pathways, and the single&#8208;molecule conductance is enhanced by more than 70% by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation with pyridine and pyrazine. But the through&#8208;bond charge transport pathways contribute much less to the conductance of o&#8208;HP derivatives. These results not only provide a new method for exploring stable helical molecules, but also pave a stepping stone for deciphering and modulating the charge transport behavior of helical systems at the single&#8208;molecule level.</dc:description>

         <title>Sublimation Transformation Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable catalytic reactivity. However, achieving atomically precise control in the fabrication of DACs remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed a straightforward and direct sublimation transformation synthesis strategy for dual&#8208;atom Fe catalysts (Fe2/NC) by utilizing in situ generated Fe2Cl6(g) dimers from FeCl3(s). The structure of Fe2/NC was investigated by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. As&#8208;obtained Fe2/NC, with a Fe&#8211;Fe distance of 0.3 nm inherited from Fe2Cl6, displayed superior oxygen reduction performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90 V (vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts, Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/NC), and its counterpart with a common and shorter Fe&#8211;Fe distance of ~0.25 nm (Fe2/NC&#8208;S). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis revealed the extended Fe&#8211;Fe distance in Fe2/NC is crucial for the O2 adsorption on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This work not only introduces a new approach for fabricating atomically precise DACs, but also offers a deeper understanding of the intermetallic distance effect on dual&#8208;site catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Tumor Permeating DNA Nanoplatform for Efficient Remodeling of Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limited intratumoral permeation have largely constrained the outcome of tumor therapy. Herein, we report a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability for targeted remodeling of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in vivo. In our design, chemo&#8208;immunomodulator (gemcitabine) can be precisely grafted in DNA sequences via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive linker. After self&#8208;assembly, the gemcitabine&#8208;grafted DNA structure can site&#8208;specifically organize legumain&#8208;activatable melittin pro&#8208;peptide (promelittin) on each vertex for intratumoral delivery and further function as the template to load photosensitizers (methylene blue) for ROS production. The tailored DNA nanoplatform can achieve targeted accumulation, highly improved intratumoral permeation, and efficient immunogenic cell death of tumor cells by laser irradiation. Finally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can be successfully remodeled by reducing multi&#8208;type immunosuppressive cells and enhancing the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the tumor. This rationally developed multifunctional DNA nanoplatform provides a new avenue for the development of tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) process, chiral functional monomers undergo spontaneous supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and asymmetric stacking during living polymerization, leading to the in&#8208;situ generation of chiroptical polymer assemblies characterized by diverse morphologies. The PICSA strategy facilitates precise control and manipulation of both non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helices and covalent macromolecular helices within aggregated cores, thereby driving significant advancements in fields such as chiral recognition materials, asymmetric catalysts, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals (LC). This minireview summarizes recent developments in the in&#8208;situ chiroptical construction and modulation associated with the PICSA methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to elucidate emerging PICSA systems founded on various living polymerization mechanisms, exploring hierarchical chirality transfer processes and the pathway complexities in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Mo Migration&#8208;Induced Crystalline to Amorphous Conversion and Formation of RuMo/NiMoO4 Heterogeneous Nanoarray for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the atomic structure of the catalyst and tailoring the dissociative water&#8208;hydrogen bonding network at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface is essential for propelling alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), but remains a great challenge. Herein, we constructed an advanced a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF heterogeneous electrocatalysts with amorphous RuMo alloy nanoclusters anchored to amorphous NiMoO4 skeletons on Ni foam by a heteroatom implantation strategy. Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ Raman tests show that the amorphous and alloying structure of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF not only induces the directional evolution of interfacial H2O, but also lowers the d&#8208;band center (from &#8208;0.43 to &#8208;2.22 eV) of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*, from &#8208;1.29 to &#8208;0.06 eV), and the energy barrier of HzOR (&#916;GN2(g) = 1.50 eV to &#916;GN2* = 0.47 eV). Profiting from these favorable factors, the a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances, especially at large current densities, with an overpotential of 13 and 129 mV to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 for HER. While for HzOR, it needs only &#8208;91 and 276 mV to deliver 10 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. Further, the constructed a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF||a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer demands only 7 and 420 mV to afford 10 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;linked Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular&#160;charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry between building blocks are critical factors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOF) based photocatalyst. However, robust achieving both simultaneously has yet to be challenging despite ongoing efforts. Here we develop a fully&#160;&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated vinylene&#8208;linked multivariate donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor MCOF (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, termed UJN&#8208;1)by integrating&#160;integrating benzyl cyanides linker&#160;with multiple functional building blocks of electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine and electron&#8208;deficient copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs)&#160;moieties, featuring with strong&#160;intramolecular charge separation driving force, extended conjugation degree of skeleton, and abundant active sites.&#160;The incorporation of Cu&#8208;CTUs acceptor with electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and concomitantly giant charge separation driving force can efficiently accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from triphenylamine to Cu&#8208;CTUs, revealing by experiments and theoretical calculations. Benefiting from&#160;the synergistically effect of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration and vinylene linkage, the highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation&#160;is achieved.

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carefully curated dataset of reactions catalyzed by magnesium&#8208;based catalysts underlies a Machine&#8208;Learning model guiding the choices of catalysts &#8220;optimal&#8221; for reactions unseen during training. When this model is tested by experiment, it suggests catalysts that yield higher ee values, replace rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts, or improve the efficiency of stereoselective transformations relevant to drug discovery.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221;&#8212;in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess&#8212;for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two NO&#8208;releasing phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers have been prepared which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration through the NO released upon the interaction with the intracellular glutathione, sparing more oxygen for the photodynamic action. This oxygen&#8208;economized photodynamic therapy can also elicit the release of various damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, effectively triggering immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.







Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Spinel Octahedral Sites via a &#960;&#8211;&#960; Type Orbital Coupling to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in Co3O4 can be fine&#8208;regulated by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling involving the CoOh t2g, O 2p, and Ce t2u orbital. Mechanism investigations reveal that&#160;a &#960;&#8208;donation interaction between the bridging O 2p and Ce fyz2 orbital effectively bolsters the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. The obtained electrocatalyst with the eg occupancy optimized to 1.094 presents an excellent water oxidation performance.







Abstract
Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7&#8201;% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.

         <title>A Fragment&#8208;Based Competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR Platform For Hotspot&#8208;Directed Ligand Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fragment screening identified three ligand binding hotspots across the active site of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment sized fluorinated reporters were developed for each hotspot and used in competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR experiments to quantify hotspot&#8208;specific ligand binding affinities across three orders of magnitude, from low mM to low &#956;M.







Abstract
Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F Ligand Based&#8197;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of 19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single 19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of 19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of Cu facets on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Li deposition behavior are demonstrated using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.







Abstract
The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single-crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic-rich SEI. Consequently, the single-crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s-Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite-free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s-Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah-level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high-performance Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. The best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers.







Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transfer from the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state to the first triplet excited state (T1) are investigated in upconversion organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with 45 different material combinations. According to our analysis based on the semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory, CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV) and is expressed by a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring the dynamics of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron&#8208;transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited&#8208;state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T1, their energetics and electron&#8208;transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully constructed uniform highly fluorinated nanospaces without impurities such as metals. This highly hydrophobic nanospace exhibits high water stability, and is the first all&#8208;organic hydrophobic nanospace where water molecules can enter. Furthermore, this nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity of 1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH.







Abstract
Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace adsorbs 160&#8197;mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0=0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm) at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH. POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown-6 (&lt;b&gt;TPy18C6&lt;/b&gt;), for COF fabrication (&lt;b&gt;ACE-COF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;ACE-COF-2&lt;/b&gt;) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped COFs (&lt;b&gt;Ni@ACE-COF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ni@ACE-COF-2&lt;/b&gt;) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and exceptional cycling stability (&amp;gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel-zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic-synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>

For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two-electron-active &lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt; catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|&lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt; batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of &lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt;, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Chromium&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) Reaction Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Driven Autonomous Janus Electromagnets as Magnetotactic Swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non&#8208;ferromagnetic, chemically&#8208;driven electromagnets.







Abstract
An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#956;T upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x=P&#8208;substituent, y=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8722;I d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8722;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte design is presented. Based on an explainable method, the halogenoid property of the cyanide group is demonstrated similar to fluorine in molecular properties. 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the LiCoO2/Li cell operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3&#8201;% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.







Abstract
We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;Efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trilayer polymer electrolyte was devised to enable the coexistence of high local pH at the cathode surface and acidic interfaces within the membrane, thus concurrently favoring C2H4 formation and addressing the CO2 loss issue. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of ~46&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass conversion of ~32&#8201;% were achieved for C2H4 at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyzers exhibit high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity, low full-cell voltages, and cost-effectiveness. However, the issue of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH-fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to a C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM-MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE-MEA electrolyzer reduces the full-cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; without compromising the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; FE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

Droplets dancing to non&#8208;classical tunes. Nishant Singh and co&#8208;workers (e202406220) show in their Communication how phase&#8208;separated amino acid droplets can non&#8208;classically evolve into poly&#8208;crystals and fibrous hydrogels. Several complex and direct pathways are explored to achieve transient or stable soft materials, single&#8208; or poly&#8208;crystals by provoking disordered droplets.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. In their Research Article (e202406551) Eduard Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. show the utility of an active&#8208;feedback wireless NMR masing detector with the quality factor enhancement up to 1,000,000 to create a RASER at 300 MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional passive NMR detectors. This active&#8208;feedback&#8208;circuit approach potentially enables RASER sensing in a wide range of in vivo applications.

Two structurally intricate heterometallic clusters with cores featuring multiple Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra were synthesized by ligand&#8208;controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ni2+ and Dy3+ ions, as reported by Zhiping Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409109). Adjusting the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;promoting base and the reaction temperature and duration afforded selectively the kinetic and thermodynamic species, respectively with a Dy112Ni76 and a Dy52Ni44 core.

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysts harness sunlight to convert biomass and plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemicals. These feedstocks utilize photogenerated electrons and/or holes to undergo reduction and/or oxidation transformations, enabling catalytic upgrading in a low&#8208;carbon, renewable energy&#8208;driven, and environmentally friendly manner.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII ions can be constructed using p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (H4TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3 T.







Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of FeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O and H4TBC[4] in a basic dmf/EtOH solution affords an [FeIII18] Keplerate conforming to a stellated cuboctahedron. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements reveal spin frustration effects arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at ~10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3&#8197;T.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of hierarchical assemblies of Fmoc&#8208;Leu are accessed using non&#8208;classical and classical nucleation following complex pathways. Chemical and thermal inputs lead to phase separated sub&#8208;micron liquid and solid droplets which can transform to fibrous stable hydrogel, transient metastable hydrogels, and milli&#8208;metric polycrystal spherulites or single crystals.







Abstract
Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined strategy involving molecular dynamics simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to manipulate the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of PfNS protein resulted in the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions, such as the conversion between bicyclic and tricyclic structures and the transition from Type&#8197;B to Type&#8197;A function, thus resulting in the production of new sesterterpenes.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsis fici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS&#8242;s function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type&#8197;B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type&#8197;A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.

         <title>Photochargeable Mn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Decoupled Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
MnBr&#8208;253 particles were synthesized as three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on MOF&#8208;253 and MnBr(CO)3(bpy) complexes, designed as off&#8208;grid colloidal systems aimed at decoupling light harvesting and high&#8208;energy electron storage. Achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion/storage quantum yield and charging rate, the framework was applied for temporally decoupled dark H2 evolution.







Abstract
Designing multifunctional materials that mimic the light&#8208;dark decoupling of natural photosynthesis is a key challenge in the field of energy conversion. Herein, we introduce MnBr&#8208;253, a precious metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built on Al nodes, bipyridine linkers and MnBr(CO)3(bipyridine) complexes. Upon irradiation, MnBr&#8208;253 colloids demonstrate an electron photocharging capacity of ~42&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF, with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocharging rate (1.28&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF) and incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency of ~9.4&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. Spectroscopic and computational studies support effective electron accumulation at the Mn complex while high porosity and Mn loading account for the notable electron storage performance. The charged MnBr&#8208;253 powders were successfully applied for hydrogen evolution under dark conditions thus emulating the light&#8208;decoupled reactivity of photosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MnBr-253&lt;/b&gt; particles were synthesized as three-dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on MOF-253 and MnBr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy) complexes, designed as off-grid colloidal systems aimed at decoupling light harvesting and high-energy electron storage. Achieving state-of-the-art incident photon-to-electron conversion/storage quantum yield and charging rate, the framework was applied for temporally decoupled dark H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>

Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economically feasible strategy, simple hypercrosslinking, is proposed to construct ion exchange membranes with microporosity. The presented membranes balance well with high ion conductivity and high ion selectivity and show superiority in process simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and anti&#8208;swelling, thus enabling high&#8208;efficiency and stable cycling of pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries.







Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well&#8208;developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017&#8201;% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene, a new buckybowl bearing an internal sp3 carbon atom in the backbone, unexpectedly exhibits wide absorption and emission bands. The methyl group is exclusively located at the convex surface, bolstering the bowl geometry. All molecules form unidirectional bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking to generate polar crystals.







Abstract
exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9&#8197;kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93&#8197;&#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850&#8197;nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.01&#8197;eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

     alt="Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross-Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy for the coupling of N-nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non-canonical amino acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy for transition metal-free cross-coupling of alkyl nitroso-carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Csp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cross-coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non-canonical amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures. This study may pave the way towards a new class of perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

         <title>Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Enhancement of Low Temperature Superionic Conductivity by Suppression of Li Site Ordering in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isovalent substitution of Ge4+ for Si4+ in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I is observed for x&#8804;1.2. Control of unit cell volume via this substitution enhances Li+ site disorder beyond Li7Si2S7I. This extensive disorder is stabilised to 30&#8197;K with very low activation energies observed by 7Li NMR, yielding low temperature Li+ transport in highly substituted (x=1 &amp; 1.2) materials that is comparable to best&#8208;in&#8208;class solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
Ge4+ substitution into the recently discovered superionic conductor Li7Si2S7I is demonstrated by synthesis of Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I, where x&#8804;1.2. The anion packing and tetrahedral silicon location of Li7Si2S7I are retained upon substitution. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that substitution of larger Ge4+ for Si4+ expands the unit cell volume and further increases Li+ site disorder, such that Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I has one Li+ site more (sixteen in total) than Li7Si2S7I. The ionic conductivity of Li7Si0.8Ge1.2S7I (x=1.2) at 303&#8197;K is 1.02(3)&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with low activation energies for Li+ transport demonstrated over a wide temperature range by AC impedance and 7Li NMR spectroscopy. All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30&#8197;K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200&#8197;K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li+ ion conducting materials.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral P,N ligands were synthesized through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ATH of in situ generated iminophosphines. The transient interaction between iminium and phosphine groups as a Lewis acid&#8208;base pair causes the labilization of the stereogenic axis, enabling the scenario for a DKR. The reaction proceeds with good to high yields and reaching up to 99&#8201;% ee across a range of substrates, including both dicyclohexyl&#8208; and diphenylphosphino derivatives.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters was developed. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention due to their common occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. Nevertheless, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and persistent goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups play a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity. This approach provides a general, modular and divergent framework for quickly synthesizing chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise challenging to access. In addition, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Reprograms Cellular Metabolism to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy and Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer was anchored with the metabolic reprogramming agent 3&#8208;bromopyruvate to enhance photodynamic therapy and antitumor immunity by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to elicit antitumor immunity, reject tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevent lung metastasis.







Abstract
Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8208;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90&#8201;% with 40&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98&#8201;% tumor inhibition and 80&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free.

Depolymerization of native lignin for the production of functionalized aromatics was realized over irradiated colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 microbelts. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible colloidization&#8208;aggregation for both efficient reaction and facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for the generation of RS&#8901; for selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin.







Abstract
The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8&#8197;wt&#8201;% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8&#8197;h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).

&#8220;I advise my students to take unexpected results seriously, as discovery begins when we open our minds to things we can't anticipate or explain&#8230; The most important factor in the choice of my current research topic was realizing that the global inequality in access to energy and medical diagnostics is not fundamentally unaddressable: there is simply a lack of accessible technologies&#8230;&#8221; Find out more about Makhsud Saidaminov in his Introducing&#8230; Profile.
