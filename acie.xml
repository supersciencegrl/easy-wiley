         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled (Aza)BODIPY Dyes for Biomedical in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview classifies (aza)BODIPY dyes according to their molecular stacking modes and aggregate types (H&#8208;, oblique&#8208;, or J&#8208;type) in aqueous media, correlating these features with their multimodal imaging performance. By linking molecular design, exciton coupling, and pathway&#8208;dependent assembly, we provide a framework for engineering next&#8208;generation (aza)BODIPY systems with tunable, multifunctional biomedical imaging capabilities.








Abstract
4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes (BODIPYs) and their N&#8208;containing analogs (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) are highly versatile organic dyes that combine excellent photophysical, electronic, and supramolecular properties with high chemical stability. These features have enabled their use in diverse applications such as bioimaging, targeted drug delivery, and functional self&#8208;assembled materials. Their broad structural modularity allows different stacking modes with controlled exciton coupling during self&#8208;assembly, resulting in supramolecular materials with tunable spectroscopic and morphological properties. This is particularly relevant in aqueous media, where tunable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and emission are essential for advanced contrast agents (CAs) in biomedical imaging. Besides meso&#8208;heteroatom modification, J&#8208;aggregation stands out as especially advantageous for achieving red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, thereby improving tissue penetration and reducing autofluorescence and light scattering. Of particular promise is the concept of pathway complexity, whereby a single (aza)BODIPY scaffold can access multiple aggregated states with distinct photophysical signatures, enabling stimuli&#8208;responsive and multifunctional imaging behavior. Hence, understanding the interplay between (aza)BODIPY molecular design, exciton coupling in aqueous media and their resulting supramolecular and bioimaging properties is of utmost importance. This minireview discusses recent advances in (aza)BODIPY&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled structures used as CA platforms for in vivo biomedical imaging and highlights the structure&#8211;property relationships that govern their performance.

         <title>Bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Diarylethene Palladium Complexes: Dynamic Behavior and Self&#8208;Tuning Photoswitching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of catalytic activity of transition metal complexes remains a challenging task. We present a diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable system that enables the attainment of diverse states of the NHC ligand within the single palladium complex through thermal and photochemical cis&#8208;trans and syn&#8208;anti isomerizations, as well as reversible photocyclization. Our investigations reveal that the switch controls the electronic properties of the complex as well as the formation of nanoparticles and catalytic activity.








Abstract
Light offers a unique means of controlling matter with high precision, yet the development of robust photoresponsive transition&#8208;metal complexes remains a challenge. Here we report a self&#8208;tuning photochromic system based on a diarylethene&#8208;derived bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;palladium complex. The trans&#8208;anti complex (1oo) undergoes efficient stepwise photocyclization as well as unprecedented light&#8208;induced trans/cis isomerization at the metal center. Isolation and crystallographic characterization of the cis&#8208;anti isomer (2oo) reveal a thermodynamically more stable structure with enhanced photochromic performance and reversible multistate switching. Thermal studies uncover interconversion with additional rotamer, establishing a dynamic equilibrium among several photoactive palladium species. Spectroscopic and computational investigations elucidate the electronic transitions that drive both diarylethene cyclization and Pd&#9472;NHC geometric rearrangements. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction can be reversibly switched by light, with the photocyclized catalyst forms showing negligible catalytic activity, while the open forms achieve high efficiency. This establishes a direct link between photoisomerization and predicted catalytic performance. Pre&#8208;catalyst evolution demonstrates that the geometry of the complex controls the balance between nanoparticle&#8208;mediated and homogeneous reactivity, delineating a novel strategy for adaptive catalysis.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Modular Reactor with a Chiral Microenvironment Enhances the Biocatalytic Synthesis of Norepinephrine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the low stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA), a continuous&#8208;flow modular reactor with a chiral microenvironment is constructed. Its first module (L&#8208;TA@L&#8208;Arg&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67) enhances C&#946; stereoselectivity for converting 3,4&#8208;dihydroxybenzaldehyde and glycine to L&#8208;droxidopa, while the second module (YD@Ca2(PO4)3) matches the catalytic rate required for norepinephrine (NE) biosynthesis. This integrated system boosts stereoselectivity and yield, enabling efficient NE production.








Abstract
Chirality lies at the core of pharmaceutical molecular design. Multi&#8208;enzyme cascade catalysis offers high stereoselectivity for constructing such molecules. Here, we present a continuous&#8208;flow modular reactor engineered with a chiral microenvironment for the biocatalytic synthesis of norepinephrine. This system incorporates two functional modules: a chiral catalytic reactor, designed to enhance the C&#946; stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;TA), and a decarboxylation reactor to balance catalytic rates. Modifying the microenvironment surrounding L&#8208;TA significantly enhanced its stereoselectivity, with 4.1 times increased the de value (from 18.4% to 75.01%). Seen from molecular dynamics simulations, these modifications reshaped the spatial conformation of the enzyme's active site. Moreover, at an optimal column height ratio of 3:5 between the chiral and decarboxylation modules, norepinephrine yield reached 3.07&#160;g/L. This modular reactor strategy, enhanced by a tailored chiral microenvironment, offers substantial promise for the stereoselective synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates.

         <title>Accelerating Electrochemical Kinetics in Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 Cathodes Through Oxygen Vacancy Modulation for Wide&#8208;Temperature Ah&#8208;Level Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering oxygen vacancies in Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) via an off&#8208;stoichiometric strategy enhances its conductivity. This yields a high&#8208;grade, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich NFPP with a narrowed band gap, accelerated Na+/e&#8722; transport, and suppressed volume expansion, thereby establishing a general design for advanced iron&#8208;based polyanionic electrodes.








Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) stands as a highly promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, offering a favorable combination of operating voltage and theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, its commercial viability is significantly hindered by two primary factors: the prevalent formation of electrochemically inert impurity phases, such as maricite&#8208;NaFePO4 and low&#8208;energy&#8208;density Na2FeP2O7, during conventional synthesis, coupled with its intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we demonstrate a rational defect&#8208;engineering strategy to enhance the electrochemical kinetics of NFPP cathodes through controlled oxygen vacancy formation. The optimized Na4Fe2.79(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP&#8208;2.79) exhibits superior phase purity, enhanced electronic conductivity, and facilitated Na+ diffusion, as confirmed by multi&#8208;scale characterization techniques. The NFPP&#8208;2.79 cathode delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 89.51 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10C and retains 96.42% capacity after 1500 cycles at 2C. Moreover, kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis using cost&#8208;effective raw precursors has been achieved via a sand&#8208;milling&#8208;assisted spray&#8208;drying route. When assembled into Ah&#8208;level pouch cells with hard carbon anodes, the NFPP&#8208;2.79&#8208;based cell demonstrates excellent rate capability (93.75% capacity retention from 0.5C to 4C), outstanding cyclability (75.63% retention after 3000 cycles), and superior safety under extreme conditions (overheating, crushing, nail penetration, overcharge, and external short&#8208;circuit). This work highlights oxygen vacancy modulation as an effective pathway for advancing polyanionic cathodes toward practical applications.

         <title>Photothermal Conversion Promotes Challenging SNAr for Facile C&#9472;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal conversion enables facile aromatic C&#9472;N bond formation via red light irradiation. A variety of inter&#8208; and intramolecular SNAr transformations are achieved under mild, schematically simple conditions. Additionally, a thermally promoted halogen exchange mechanism provides access to aryl bromides, chlorides, and fluorides &#8211; making this approach an excellent synthetic tool for forming aromatic C&#9472;N bonds.








Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is a widely used method for forming aromatic C&#9472;N bonds, which are of interest in both industry and academia. However, current approaches are often unable to access less activated electrophiles, due to negative charge buildup in the transition state, resulting in high activation energy barriers. Inspired by our work on the Newman Kwart Rearrangement (NKR), we sought to leverage photothermal conversion for challenging C&#9472;N bond&#8208;forming SNAr reactions. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of an inexpensive photothermal agent, carbon black, and irradiation with red light affords several poorly activated intermolecular substitution reactions. Application to less activated aryl halides resulted in unproductive reactivity, leading us to examine the reaction barriers. Computations revealed barriers within the range previously achieved during our photothermally mediated NKR. Electronically neutral intramolecular analogs were synthesized and underwent productive reactivity in short time frames (&#8804;20 min), indicating that the inhomogeneous nature of photothermal heating was a challenge in terms of colocalizing reactants sufficiently close to the particle. This concept was leveraged into a sequential SNAr, where an initial intermolecular reaction occurs which then primes the substrate for a more difficult intramolecular substitution. This approach afforded a diverse scope of fused heterocycles.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Doping Enables Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Triarylboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While pure triarylboranes show RTP in annealed PMMA films, they do not in crystalline form, contrary to our previous report. However, crystalline host&#8208;guest triarylborane systems show persistent afterglow up to&#160;8&#160;s even at 1 ppb guest loading. Computations identify triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer as the mechanism governing this efficient RTP.








Abstract
Revisiting our previous report of RTP in triarylboranes, we found that pure crystalline triarylboranes do not exhibit RTP as initially reported, although all but one purified compound shows RTP in annealed PMMA matrices. Inspired by the impurity responsible for the previously observed RTP, we designed a family of binary host&#8211;guest RTP systems constructed by pairing distinct triarylboranes. By tuning the host and guest structures and doping ratios, afterglow visible to the naked eye for up to 8&#160;s can be achieved in crystalline materials under ambient conditions, at doping levels as low as one part per billion. The ultra&#8208;long afterglow makes these materials promising for information encryption, while their high sensitivity to oxygen in non&#8208;annealed PMMA films highlights their potential for sensing applications. Trends in the phosphorescence intensities and lifetimes, dependent on guest molecular structure, are rationalized by computed triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer rates between the hosts and guests, providing a concrete design strategy for optimizing host&#8208;guest RTP. Overall, this work underscores the critical importance of material purity and advances understanding of the host&#8208;guest interactions governing efficient organic RTP.

         <title>A Noncovalent Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Strategy to Control Bond Cleavage and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the click&#8208;to&#8208;release concept beyond covalent ligation, we introduce a noncovalent click&#8208;to&#8208;release strategy based on cucurbituril&#8208;adamantane (CB&#8208;Ad) association. A supramolecular preassembly encapsulating a self&#8208;immolative guest (SIG) is rationally designed to prevent premature release, while adding a high&#8208;affinity Ad guest initiates the CB&#8208;Ad click reaction, displacing the SIG and triggering its preprogrammed cleavage for cargo release. 








Abstract
Click&#8208;to&#8208;release chemistry enables bioorthogonal bond cleavage and controlled release via a click&#8208;type ligation reaction serving as both the trigger and means of localization. Extending this concept beyond covalent ligation reactions, we introduce a noncovalent click&#8208;to&#8208;release strategy based on cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;adamantane (CB&#8208;Ad) association. The CB host molecule forms a pre&#8208;assembled host&#8208;guest complex with a self&#8208;immolative guest (SIG) SIG1, where the masked SIG remains inert. Introduction of a high&#8208;affinity guest Ad initiates the CB&#8208;Ad noncovalent click reaction, displacing SIG1 and triggering its self&#8208;immolation and cargo release. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we used a prototype prodrug SIG2 to demonstrate our strategy's potential for controlled therapeutic release, effectively regulating the photodynamic cell killing in vitro. This noncovalent click&#8208;to&#8208;release approach broadens the structural and functional scope of bioorthogonal cleavage strategies with promising implications for stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and biomedical applications.

         <title>Amorphous, Embryonic or Mesoporized Zeolites? An Overview of Intermediate Synthetic Phases: Definitions, Characterization, and Application.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution of crystallinity in zeolite synthesis: from two possible precursor scenarios to (partially crystalline) outcomes. In the between, one can find a pool of intermediate synthetic phases, which contains the hidden gem of the recent decade &#8211; catalytically active X&#8208;ray amorphous but porous and acidic materials.








Abstract
The success of zeolites as catalysts has long been attributed to their high thermal stability and strict shape selectivity flowing from their network of well&#8208;defined channels and cages. Synthetic efforts often unjustly disregarded (partially) amorphous intermediate synthetic phases (ISPs), including embryonic zeolite, interzeolite conversion intermediates and mesoporized zeolites, as &#8220;failed&#8221; and excluded them from further characterization efforts. Recently, this perception has changed and better characterization techniques have led to a deeper understanding of the structure and catalytic potential these materials (may) hold. In this work, we will give a brief overview of the state of the art research being conducted in synthesis, characterization and exploitation of ISPs, as well as clarifying some definitions, hoping to set the stage for future generations of zeolite scientists.

         <title>Monomer&#8208;Ratio Controlled Pyridinic&#8208;N Enrichment Modulating p&#8208;Band Centers in Carbon Nanospheres for Efficient Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;engineered carbon electrocatalysts can revolutionize zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) through closed&#8208;loop design. First&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations decode atomic&#8208;scale dominance by optimizing p&#8208;band center shifts in the rate&#8208;determining step during oxygen reduction reaction. Precursor&#8208;ratio precision attains record 38.91% pyridinic&#8208;N in the optimized A0.5P0.5&#8208;NC catalyst, empowering liquid and flexible ZABs to outperform Pt/C benchmarks.








Abstract
Rational design of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is critical for advancing zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). This study proposed a closed&#8208;loop paradigm integrating first&#8208;principles active site identification, precursor&#8208;ratio&#8208;controlled synthesis, and device validation to develop superior metal&#8208;free ORR electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify pyridinic&#8208;N as the optimal doping configuration, exhibiting the lowest energy barrier (0.17&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS, *O2 &#8594; *OOH). Further electronic structure analyses revealed that this enhancement originates from pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;induced upward shifts in the p&#8208;band center of adjacent carbon atoms during the RDS, establishing this shift as a universal activity descriptor. Guided by these insights, aniline(A)/pyrrole(P) co&#8208;polymerization with precise monomer molar ratio control yielded a series of N&#8208;doped carbon materials (AxPy&#8208;NC). A0.5P0.5&#8208;NC achieved the highest pyridinic&#8208;N content (38.91%), demonstrating exceptional ORR activity that surpasses other AxPy&#8208;NC variants and the benchmark 20&#160;wt.% Pt/C. The optimized catalyst enabled transformative ZAB performance in liquid and flexible configurations, achieving enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage, superior power densities, high specific capacities, and prolonged durability compared to commercial 20&#160;wt.% Pt/C. This work establishes a catalyst development paradigm bridging mechanistic understanding, controllable synthesis, and practical application for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

A&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;-NC achieved the highest pyridinic-N content (38.91%), demonstrating exceptional ORR activity that surpasses other A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;-NC variants and the benchmark 20&#160;wt.% Pt/C. The optimized catalyst enabled transformative ZAB performance in liquid and flexible configurations, achieving enhanced open-circuit voltage, superior power densities, high specific capacities, and prolonged durability compared to commercial 20&#160;wt.% Pt/C. This work establishes a catalyst development paradigm bridging mechanistic understanding, controllable synthesis, and practical application for next-generation energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Broken Fe Spinel Electrocatalyst Enables Integrated Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broken bandgap in heteroatomic bonds leads to overlapping Fe 3d bands, causing electron redistribution and redox activity at Fe centers. This enhances the adsorption of H2O and S2&#8722; via d&#8211;p orbital coupling, which lowers the energy barriers for the key steps in both the hydrogen evolution (Volmer) and sulfur oxidation (S&#9472;S coupling) reactions. 








Abstract
Despite considerable attention on spinel catalysts in electrocatalysis, achieving their distinct redox activity at the atomic scale for cathodic seawater splitting and anodic wastewater purification represents a huge challenge. In this work, we address this issue by constructing bandgap&#8208;broken Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Co heteroatomic bonds through the integration of reduced ZnFe2O4 and oxidized CoFe2O4 semiconductors within spinel&#8208;structured ZnxCo1&#8208;xFe2O4. The overlapping conduction and valence bands at Fe 3d orbitals promote electron redistribution at Fe centers, leading to electron depletion, exposure of empty d orbitals, and modulation of the d&#8208;band center. These electronic modifications enhance the adsorption kinetics of H2O in seawater and S2&#8722; species in wastewater through d&#8211;p orbital coupling, lowering the energy barriers for the Volmer step in hydrogen evolution reaction and the rate&#8208;limiting *S&#9472;*S2 process in sulfur oxidation reaction. As a result, the rational design enables efficient bifunctional activity, achieving simultaneous seawater splitting and industrial pollutant degradation in a single electrolyzer at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.07&#160;V (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), operable under solar energy. This study provides a fundamental design strategy for bifunctional catalysts toward integrated energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Synergy&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Design: Fluoroethylene Carbonate and Succinonitrile Co&#8208;Solvation in a Eutectic Electrolyte for Stable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel FEC&#8208;enhanced ternary eutectic electrolyte stabilizes sodium interphase, enabling high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature sodium metal batteries with extended cyclability.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density and abundant sodium resources. However, high reactivity of sodium metal anodes (SMAs) presents significant challenges for practical application. Herein, we report a multifunctional ternary eutectic electrolyte, termed NSF&#8208;5, comprising sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI), succinonitrile (SN), and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in a 1:1:5 molar ratio, which enhances the cycling stability of SMAs. Combined experimental and computational studies confirm a synergistic effect between FEC and SN, where FEC integrates into the Na+ solvation sheath, regulates the desolvation process, and promotes the formation of a robust, inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, thereby suppressing sodium dendrite growth. Consequently, SMBs with NSF&#8208;5 demonstrate desirable cyclability under demanding conditions. Full cells coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 achieve over 1650 cycles with 90.5% capacity retention at 0.5 C and 3715 cycles with 80.2% retention at 10 C. Even at 0 &#176;C, the cell maintains 87.9 mAh g&#8210;1 capacity after 3500 cycles with 81.4% retention. Moreover, this versatile electrolyte formulation can be adapted to other alkali metal battery systems, underscoring its broad applicability. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte engineering in regulating the electrode&#8722;electrolyte interphase, offering valuable insights into achieving long&#8208;term cyclability of SMBs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (MCXRD) Bridges the Crystallographic Characterisation Gap in Chemistry and Materials Science: Application to MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (MCXRD) methods allow accurate structural characterisation with crystals too small for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and too large for electron diffraction, as demonstrated here for metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and alleviate the radiation&#8208;induced chemical changes that can result from using high&#8208;intensity X&#8208;ray sources to study very small crystals.








Abstract
Structure determination by X&#8208;ray diffraction is limited by crystal size and can be compromised by radiation damage when using very intense X&#8208;ray radiation. X&#8208;ray structure determination from partial diffraction data sets combined from multiple crystals is a potential solution, but its exploitation in chemistry and materials science is largely unrealized. Here we report the use of synchrotron radiation for multi&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (MCXRD) adapted for structure determination of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials with crystal dimensions too small for conventional single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies. We further show that radiation&#8208;induced chemical changes and degradation of diffraction quality can be alleviated. Our approach encompasses both rotation&#8208; and stationary&#8208;MCXRD measurements for 10 to 1000s of crystals with software&#8208;optimized combination of the multiple data sets. We report the crystal structures of six MOFs: MOF&#8208;919(Sc/Cu), MET&#8208;2, MIL&#8208;88B(Cr)&#8208;1,4&#8208;NDC, PCN&#8208;260(Sc), UiO&#8208;66, and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;MoO4 with unit cell dimensions ranging from 18&#8722;114&#160;&#197; and crystal sizes from 0.5&#8722;480&#160;&#181;m3. This approach can address the challenges of structure determination in a regime of particle size and sample radiation sensitivity that lies between existing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the emerging field of electron diffraction. MCXRD can provide accurate atomic&#8208;resolution structure determination for some of the most challenging cases in chemistry and materials science.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework and Composite as Photocatalysts Toward Sustainable CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amid the climate and energy crisis, COFs emerge as powerful photocatalysts converting CO2 into clean fuels and valuable chemicals. Their tunable, porous, ordered, and robust frameworks drive efficient CO2 reduction. This review comprehensively discusses the various design strategies and catalytic performances of metal&#8208;free, single&#8208;atom, and composite COFs, highlighting their potential to harness solar energy for a sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral future.








Abstract
The intensifying climate emergency compels a rapid paradigm shift from fossil fuel&#8208;based energy systems toward sustainable, carbon&#8208;neutral alternatives. Among emerging strategies, the photocatalytic valorization of CO2 into energy&#8208;dense fuels and commodity chemicals by suitable photocatalysts presents a straightforward and economically viable solution for both greenhouse gas mitigation and renewable energy storage. In this context, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a highly promising class of crystalline, porous semiconductor photocatalysts for CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR), owing to their structural regularity, modularity, and optoelectronic tunability. In this review, we comprehensively outline the recent progress in three distinct categories of COF&#8208;based photocatalytic systems: metal&#8208;free COFs, single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom based COFs, and COF&#8208;based composites. Key strategies such as the judicious incorporation of donor&#8211;acceptor architectures, rational post&#8208;synthetic functionalization, and heterojunction engineering are discussed. Insights from in situ operando characterization and theoretical calculations are also presented to highlight the roles of exciton dynamics, charge separation, active site engineering, and structure&#8211;function relationship in CO2RR. Finally, we propose future research directions for better utilization of COFs in solar fuel/chemical generation. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive discussion on the advancement of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and next&#8208;generation CO2 valorization materials.

         <title>Aliphatic Ligand Design Principles for Rigid Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the minuscule role of aliphatic ligands in porous materials due to their flexibility, a strategy for simultaneously scaling up and rigidifying aliphatic ligands is shown here by exploiting intramolecular interactions generated between cyclohexane units arranged in series and the resulting ligand enables diverse pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned rigid MOFs with tunable architectures for advanced gas separations.








Abstract
Aliphatic ligands are often sidelined in the design of framework materials because their conformational flexibility can contribute to problems such as difficult crystallization, low porosity, and stability. Attempts to boost porosity by ligand elongation usually worsen these problems. Here we propose an expanded bioisosteric replacement (eBIS) concept capable of both scaling up and rigidifying aliphatic ligands. We demonstrate one example realized via linking two cyclohexyl rings in series, which restricts ligand flexibility through intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions providing an alternative to the &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;based rigidity. The resulting ligand displays consistent rigidity across multiple MOF platforms. On the pacs platform, it can realize extreme pore geometry with the highest hexagonal c/a ratio and new metal&#8208;cluster chemistry such as the first synthesis of nickel&#8208;titanium oxocluster. It can boost the BET surface area to as high as 2810 m2&#160;g&#8722;1, likely the highest among aliphatic&#8208;dicarboxylate MOFs. Furthermore, it leads to possibly largest C2H6/C2H4 uptake differences (88 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1, uptake ratio of 1.83, 273&#160;K) among rigid MOFs, a desired property for C2H6&#8208;selective separation, which is confirmed by breakthrough experiments. The remarkably low adsorption enthalpies for C2H6 (14.7&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and C2H4 (15.1&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) enables low&#8208;energy adsorbent regeneration benefitting practical separation.

         <title>Homologative Radical 1,3&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Sequential Functional Group Migrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoinduced homologative 1,3&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is achieved via one&#8208;carbon chain elongation. This method proceeds through sequential functional group migrations, furnishing structurally diverse linear and medium&#8208;sized cyclic ketones.








Abstract
Despite significant advances in conventional radical&#8208;mediated 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes over the past decade, homologative 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we report a novel photoinduced homologative 1,3&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes via one&#8208;carbon chain elongation, achieved through sequential functional group migrations. By employing strategically designed tertiary alcohols and heteroarylsulfones as versatile coupling partners, this method affords structurally diverse, densely substituted aliphatic ketones and medium&#8208;sized cyclic scaffolds with exclusive chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The transformation accommodates a broad range of migrating groups, including various heteroaryl, phenyl, and alkenyl motifs, and exhibits excellent functional group tolerance.

         <title>Transforming RNA Degradation into Accurate RNA Detection: RNase I&#8211;Assisted Rolling Circle Amplification for Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we transform this otherwise destructive enzymatic activity into a powerful diagnostic advantage through an RNase I&#8211;assisted rolling circle amplification (RI&#8208;RCA) strategy. By integrating controlled RNase I&#8211;mediated RNA digestion with circular DNA templates, this approach enables direct and highly sensitive detection of target RNA sequences. Using this strategy, we successfully identified COVID&#8208;positive saliva samples by accurately detecting the presence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA in patient saliva.








Abstract
Ribonucleases are powerful degradative enzymes that rapidly cleave RNA and have long been regarded as obstacles to RNA diagnostics. Detecting large, structured RNA molecules in biological samples is further complicated by extensive secondary structures and abundant background RNA. Here we transform this destructive activity into a diagnostic advantage through a RNase I&#8211;assisted rolling circle amplification (RI&#8208;RCA) strategy that integrates enzymatic RNA digestion with circular DNA templates (CDTs) to achieve direct, reverse&#8208;transcription&#8208;free RNA detection. In this system, Escherichia coli RNase I&#8212;a widely available endoribonuclease&#8212;selectively digests structured RNA to expose complementary CDT&#8208;binding sites, which are immediately protected through duplex formation and converted into primers for RCA. The resulting reaction proceeds isothermally at room temperature in linear, quasi&#8208;exponential, and exponential modes, achieving quantitative signal generation across concentrations from 50 aM to 50 fM and maintaining performance in 50% pooled human saliva. Applied to clinical saliva samples from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8211;positive and &#8211;negative individuals, RI&#8208;RCA achieved near&#8208;perfect sensitivity and 98&#8211;100% diagnostic accuracy. By coupling enzymatic RNA digestion with sequence&#8208;specific protection via CDT hybridization, this strategy converts RNA instability from a liability into an analytical advantage, providing a simple, robust, and clinically translatable platform for accurate detection of structured RNA targets.

         <title>Solubility Activation of Recessive Solvent Mitigates Interphase Dissolution for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recessive&#8208;solvent activation is proposed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, where TFPO alone dissolves NaFSI poorly. DEE initiates NaFSI dissociation and enables TFPO&#8211;FSI&#8722; coupling, boosting solubility without strongly solvating solvents and enabling an ultra&#8208;high anion&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio, thereby forming an inorganic, dissolution&#8208;resistant SEI for stable cycling.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) triggers electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution, resulting in capacity decay and safety issues. Lowering the solvation power of electrolyte mitigates SEI dissolution but decreases ionic conductivity. Here, we report a recessive solvent activation strategy, where the recessive solvent 1,2&#8208;epoxy&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropane (TFPO) alone dissolves NaFSI only sparingly, but its solubility is greatly enhanced by the addition of an activating solvent, diethylene glycol diethyl ether (DEE). By harnessing the tunable solvation behavior of the DEE&#8211;TFPO system, we designed a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) containing 24 vol% DEE, far below the bulk&#8208;solvent fractions typical of WSEs, and a high anion&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio. This low DEE content mitigates solvent&#8208;induced SEI dissolution, while the high anion&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio promotes anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure, forming a robust inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. These effects preserve high ionic conductivity while overcome the challenge of SEI dissolution. The optimized electrolyte enabled hard carbon || NaMn0.33Fe0.33Ni0.33O2 full cells to retain 80.0% capacity after 500 cycles and 99.5% capacity in 1.0 Ah pouch cells after 230 cycles with suppressed gas release.

         <title>Spatial Mapping of Membrane Protein Interactions Using a DNA Origami Rubbing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy named DNA origami rubbing (DOR) was developed for 2D mapping of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) in cell membrane using DNA origami technology and DNA polymerase&#8208;mediated strand&#8208;elongation, mimicking making stone rubbing with rice paper and graphite. The results showed that DOR can map the fluctuation of 2D distribution of proteins induced by ligands, demonstrating its feasibility for revealing novel PPIs and making it a potential tool for disease screening and predicting medical treatment outcomes.








Abstract
Revealing the protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) of membrane proteins is as challenging as their structural reconstruction, primarily because the molecular structures and related PPIs of membrane proteins are highly dependent on the bio&#8208;membrane where they are situated. DNA origami offers a platform for manipulating molecules with nanoscale precision. Herein, we used a square&#8208;like DNA origami, refer to as DNA origami rubbing, to map the two&#8208;dimensional distribution of membrane proteins in situ. Through artificial models and cell studies, we correlated the efficiency of barcode recording of DNA origami rubbings with the distance between adjacent proteins, and we observed that the frequency of adjacent proteins mapped by DNA origami rubbings was correlated to the abundance of the bait protein. We demonstrated that the DNA origami rubbing was able to reflect the distribution change of adjacent proteins caused by adding the ligand of bait protein. Our results suggested that the DNA origami rubbing can serve as a powerful tool in the field of protein interactomics.

&lt;p&gt;Revealing the protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) of membrane proteins is as challenging as their structural reconstruction, primarily because the molecular structures and related PPIs of membrane proteins are highly dependent on the bio-membrane where they are situated. DNA origami offers a platform for manipulating molecules with nanoscale precision. Herein, we used a square-like DNA origami, refer to as DNA origami rubbing, to map the two-dimensional distribution of membrane proteins in situ. Through artificial models and cell studies, we correlated the efficiency of barcode recording of DNA origami rubbings with the distance between adjacent proteins, and we observed that the frequency of adjacent proteins mapped by DNA origami rubbings was correlated to the abundance of the bait protein. We demonstrated that the DNA origami rubbing was able to reflect the distribution change of adjacent proteins caused by adding the ligand of bait protein. Our results suggested that the DNA origami rubbing can serve as a powerful tool in the field of protein interactomics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Practical Ultralong&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Air Batteries in High&#8208;Humidity Environments: A Synergistic Strategy for Dual&#8208;Interfacial Engineering</title>

         <dc:description>
Shielding the Li&#8211;air batteries from humidity: A synergistic dual&#8208;interfacial engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;air batteries is proposed. It simultaneously tackles the challenges at both electrodes, providing efficient catalysis and superior protection from anode to cathode, breaking the strict humidity limits and achieving ultra&#8208;long cycle life under practical conditions.








Abstract
Maintaining the operational stability of Li&#8211;air batteries (LABs) in high&#8208;humidity environments is crucial for their transition from laboratory research to practical deployment. Herein, we propose a synergistic strategy for dual&#8208;interfacial engineering toward ultralong&#8208;life LABs in high&#8208;humidity environments. An iodine&#8208;based self&#8208;defense redox mediator&#8212;SnCl4 and 1,8&#8208;diiodooctane (DIO) is introduced into the electrolyte. On the cathode side, it enabled efficient bidirectional OER/ORR catalysis while forming a protective interface that suppressed both nucleophilic and hydrolytic attack. On the anode side, a highly lithiophilic, corrosion&#8208;resistant, and moisture&#8208;tolerant protective layer forms on the Li anode, which ensures stable battery operation under extremely humid conditions. The results show that the Li&#9472;O2 battery achieved more than 2400 cycles (nearly 3000&#160;h) at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and an extremely low charge potential (&lt;3.5&#160;V), coupled with a high discharge capacity of 111879 mAh g&#8722;1. Notably, the SnCl4/DIO&#8208;based LABs reached more than 1800 cycles (&gt;2160&#160;h) even in atmospheric air without humidity control. This work significantly overcomes the strict humidity limits of traditional LABs and provides an innovative strategy for developing LABs capable of operating in high&#8208;humidity environments.

         <title>Dynamic Spin Governing Asymmetric Coordination Fields in Trimetallic Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Optimal Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state redistribution of the Fe active center induced by dynamic reconstruction and the efficient functional decoupling in the asymmetric coordination field significantly optimized the *OOH formation and *OH desorption kinetics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts demonstrate theoretically superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, the limited dynamic adaptability, however, poses a giant challenge to meet the multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). Herein, we propose a &#8220;Dynamic Spin Engineering&#8221; strategy for the rational design of tri&#8208;metallic single&#8208;atom catalysts (FeZnTM&#8208;TACs) featuring asymmetric coordination fields (FeN4ZnN3TMN4). Leveraging electron synergy and spatial functional decoupling among heterometallic sites, the optimized FeZnMn&#8208;TACs exhibit exceptional ORR performance (E1/2&#160;=&#160;0.93&#160;V versus RHE) and ultra&#8208;long stability (&#916;E1/2&#160;=&#160;24&#160;mV after 90,000 cycles). Through operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure&#160;and spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory, we unveil the scalability of a ternary synergy encompassing dynamic reconstruction, charge compensation and spin&#8208;state transition, clarifying the roles of electron donors at the ZnN3 sites and proton supply at MnN4 sites. Dynamic FeNxCy evolution triggers a spin&#8208;state transition from medium spin (MS&#160;=&#160;1.5) to low spin (LS&#160;=&#160;1.0), accompanied by the dxz/dyz orbital occupancy degree from 50% to 100%. As a consequence, we synergize the dual optimization of *OOH formation and *OH desorption in PCET. Moreover, our work atomically deciphers the spin redistribution mechanism driven by dynamic reconstruction, establishing a new paradigm for designing self&#8208;adaptive electrocatalysts that ultimately unify ultrahigh activity with operational stability.

         <title>Pulse&#8208;Electrodeposited Single&#8208;Atom Alloys with Steered Surface Hydrogenation Dynamics for Air&#8208;to&#8208;Fertilizer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;to&#8208;fertilizer offers a distributed, low&#8208;carbon route for nitrogen production. A large&#8208;language&#8208;model&#8208;guided cooperative descriptor enables the programmable synthesis of copper single&#8208;atom alloy catalysts. Time&#8208;resolved surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy reveals the hydrogenation dynamics governing nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, enabling direct fertilizer production from air in an integrated plasma&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;carbon capture system.








Abstract
Harnessing renewable electricity to transform abundant environmental resources into fertilizers is central to sustainable development. Electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion provides a promising route, yet its efficiency is constrained by the elusive surface hydrogenation dynamics governing multi&#8208;step *NOx reduction. Here, a cooperative descriptor (&#936;) derived from large&#8208;language&#8208;models&#8208;assisted mining and energetic analysis successfully identifies NiCu single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) as optimal catalysts. Pulse electrodeposition delivers atomically dispersed alloys with tunable structures, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;95% and yield rate (YR) of &#8764;11.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. In situ surface&#8208;interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI&#8208;SECM) provides quantitative information on the time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;active hydrogen (*H) generation&#8208;consumption and *NOx hydrogenation rate constants (NiCu&#160;&gt;&#160;CoCu&#160;&#8811;&#160;MnCu &#8776; FeCu&#160;&gt;&#160;Cu), directly aligning surface kinetics with selectivity. Theoretical investigations further confirmed that Ni doping lowers the barriers for *H formation and *NOx hydrogenation. A plasma&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;CO2 capture system demonstrated continuous &#8220;air&#8208;to&#8208;fertilizer&#8221; conversion with reduced energy consumption and potential net&#8208;negative emissions. These results establish a transferable design rule that bridges theoretical descriptors with operando hydrogenation dynamics, providing a mechanistic foundation and practical pathway toward scalable, zero&#8208;carbon fertilizer production.

         <title>Robust Interface Enabled by Bicontinuous&#8208;Structured Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicontinuous&#8208;structured elastomeric solid&#8208;state electrolyte (P(BA&#8208;SN)&#8208;IL) for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li batteries, which achieves simultaneous high resilience, robust interfacial contact, high ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability. Benefiting from the advantages of rigid phase and elastic phase, the P(BA&#8208;SN)&#8208;IL electrolyte demonstrates a high ionic conductivity of 7.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and high modulus of resilience of 0.89&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;O2 batteries incorporating this electrolyte exhibit excellent cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (19&#160;516 mAh g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, superior electrochemical stability, and mechanical durability are safe and reliable for solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries. However, most existing SSEs suffer from limited mechanical resilience and poor interface contact, impeding their practical deployment. Here, an in situ phase separation strategy is proposed to construct a class of elastomeric solid&#8208;state electrolytes with bicontinuous architecture. The rigid phase ensures high ionic conductivity (7.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), while the elastic phase provides excellent elastic restorability (82%) and strong interface contact (adhesion energy &#8776;43.9&#160;J m&#8722;2). This bicontinuous structure endows the material with superior stretchability (1800%), fatigue resistance, and puncture strength, while maintaining interface contact, keeping mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling, and restraining the dendrite growth. Consequently, symmetric batteries exhibit no short&#8208;circuiting even after 2000 h of operation, and Li&#8211;metal batteries demonstrate high specific capacity. Solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;O2 batteries fabricated with the P(BA&#8208;SN)&#8208;IL electrolyte also exhibit good cycling performance (500 cycles), and the Li&#8211;O2 pouch cell achieves stable cycling and superior feasibility under various abuse tests, including bending and squeezing. The bicontinuous&#8208;structured elastomer electrolytes present a highly promising strategy for enabling safe operation of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, superior electrochemical stability, and mechanical durability are safe and reliable for solid-state lithium (Li) batteries. However, most existing SSEs suffer from limited mechanical resilience and poor interface contact, impeding their practical deployment. Here, an in situ phase separation strategy is proposed to construct a class of elastomeric solid-state electrolytes with bicontinuous architecture. The rigid phase ensures high ionic conductivity (7.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C), while the elastic phase provides excellent elastic restorability (82%) and strong interface contact (adhesion energy &#8776;43.9&#160;J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This bicontinuous structure endows the material with superior stretchability (1800%), fatigue resistance, and puncture strength, while maintaining interface contact, keeping mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling, and restraining the dendrite growth. Consequently, symmetric batteries exhibit no short-circuiting even after 2000 h of operation, and Li&#8211;metal batteries demonstrate high specific capacity. Solid-state Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries fabricated with the P(BA-SN)-IL electrolyte also exhibit good cycling performance (500 cycles), and the Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell achieves stable cycling and superior feasibility under various abuse tests, including bending and squeezing. The bicontinuous-structured elastomer electrolytes present a highly promising strategy for enabling safe operation of high-energy solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gaseous SO2 Additive for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste&#8208;derived SO2 serves as a multifunctional electrolyte additive, forming protective sulfur&#8208;rich interphases on both electrodes via its unique redox potential. This enables ultra&#8208;stable cycling in 4.4&#160;V&#8208;class AG || NCM613 and Ah&#8208;level Si/C || NCM811 pouch cell while extending operational temperatures (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C to 45&#160;&#176;C), transforming pollutants into valuable components for sustainable design. 








Abstract
Electrolyte additive engineering is pivotal for suppressing interfacial degradation and enhancing the cycling stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, conventional solid or liquid additives face inherent limitations such as high production costs, chemical instability, and inefficient interfacial passivation, restricting their practical application. Here, we propose an electrolyte engineering strategy that makes sustainable use of sulfur dioxide (SO2), an industrial waste&#8208;derived gas, as a dual&#8208;functional gaseous additive. Owing to its ultrahigh reduction potential (2.6&#160;V versus Li+/Li), which exceeds that of most known additives, and a low oxidation potential, SO2 promotes the in situ formation of sulfur&#8208;containing interphases on both electrodes through preferential electrochemical reactions, thereby effectively suppressing parasitic electrolyte decomposition. SO2 enables 4.4&#160;V&#8208;class AG || NCM613 pouch cells to achieve exceptional cyclability exceeding 800 cycles with 88.2% capacity retention, along with outstanding temperature tolerance from &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C to 45&#160;&#176;C. This strategy also demonstrates universal applicability, yielding a long life of 800 cycles for Ah&#8208;level 4.3&#160;V&#8208;class Si/C || NCM811 pouch cells. Furthermore, this approach alleviates electrolyte discoloration, extending shelf life while reducing cost and energy consumption. This work establishes a sustainable circular economy model by valorizing industrial exhaust into high&#8208;value battery components, bridging environmental stewardship with next&#8208;generation energy storage innovation.

         <title>Empowering Precision C&#8211;H Functionalization: Advances in Peroxygenase Engineering</title>

Rational protein engineering endows peroxygenases with high expression, improved activity and selectivity, and increased tolerance to H2O2, enabling efficient oxyfunctionalization of diverse substrates using hydrogen peroxide as a sustainable oxidant








Abstract
Selective C&#8211;H functionalization remains a central challenge in modern synthesis as it enables direct diversification of molecular scaffolds without pre&#8208;functionalization. Peroxygenases, including both unspecific peroxygenases and P450 peroxygenases, offer a biocatalytic solution to this challenge, catalyzing oxyfunctionalization reactions in aqueous media under mild conditions with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the sole oxidant. In this review, we highlight recent advances in peroxygenase engineering over the past five years, with a particular focus on strategies that enhance heterologous expression, catalytic activity, and control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. We also discuss protein engineering approaches that mitigate H2O2&#8208;induced inactivation and summarize efforts to repurpose NADPH&#8208;dependent P450 enzymes into self&#8208;sufficient peroxygenases, thereby expanding their catalytic repertoire. Furthermore, we examine the integration of peroxygenases with in situ H2O2 generation systems by enzymatic, chemical, photocatalytic, and electrochemical methods to achieve balanced oxidant delivery and sustained turnover. Collectively, these developments have established peroxygenases as versatile and robust catalysts for selective C&#8211;H functionalization, opening new opportunities for their application in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agrochemicals.

         <title>Stable BF2 Boracycles as Versatile Reagents for Selective Ortho C&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust, metal&#8208;free and scalable synthesis of stable BF2 boracycles via directed ortho CH borylation, delivering isolable, shelf&#8208;stable reagents without chromatographic purification. These BF2 boracycles exhibit unique and tunable reactivity, enabling highly selective ipso&#8208;functionalization across a broad range of transformations. Their exceptional stability, wide substrate scope, and superior reactivity establish BF2 boracycles as powerful alternatives to conventional organoboron reagents for pharmaceutical and radiochemical applications.








Abstract
The development of new boron reagents continues to play a crucial role in advancing modern organic synthesis, particularly in C&#8211;H functionalization and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free, robust, and scalable multigram protocol for the synthesis of stable BF2 boracycles that require no column chromatography, providing a practical and efficient route to access this valuable boron species. The BF2 boracycles exhibit enhanced stability and reactivity, making them highly versatile intermediates for late&#8208;stage diversification. They undergo ipso&#8208;substitution to afford a wide array of derivatives, including halogenated (e.g., radioiodinated), hydroxylated, and azidated products. Furthermore, they display excellent reactivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions, enabling both C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond formation. These results underscore the utility of BF2 boracycles as powerful tools for selective functionalization in pharmaceutical synthesis and beyond. Our work represents a significant advancement in organoboron chemistry, offering both a streamlined synthetic approach and broad applicability for complex molecule construction.

         <title>Double E&#9472;H Bond Activation of Ammonia and Water by Cyclic Gallaphosphene L(OCP)GaPGaL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic gallaphosphene 1 undergoes a twofold E&#9472;H bond activation with ammonia and water via a beneficial interplay between the polar &#8220;GaPGa&#8221; unit and the electrophilic nature of the C center in the bridging PCO unit, yielding six&#8208;membered heterocycles 2 and 3, in which both nucleophilic phosphorus atoms are protonated.








Abstract
Cyclic gallaphosphene L(PCO)GaPGaL 1 (L&#160;=&#160;HC[C(Me)NAr]2; Ar = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2&#8208;C6H3) selectively reacts with NH3 and H2O at ambient temperature with twofold N&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bond activation and formation of compounds LGa(&#956;&#8208;PH)(&#956;&#8208;NHC(O)PH)GaL 2 and LGa(&#956;&#8208;PH)(&#956;&#8208;OC(O)PH)GaL 3. Both nucleophilic P atoms of 1 are protonated in these reactions, while the electrophilic carbon atom of the bridging PCO unit binds to the remaining NH group / O atom. The formation of heterocycles 2 and 3, which were characterized by heteronuclear NMR (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD), is only possible due to a beneficial interplay between the polar Ga&#9472;P double bond and the electrophilic nature of the C center in the bridging PCO unit. The reaction mechanism and energetics of the NH3 reaction was investigated in detail by quantum chemical calculations, which also highlight the importance of bimolecular reaction processes with the involvement of an additional NH3 molecule.

         <title>Reversing V&#9552;O Orientation of Vanadyl Phthalocyanine as "Molecular Switch" on Carbon Nitride Boosts CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable molecular orientation of vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) on hydroxylated C3N4 precisely tailors the local catalytic microenvironment. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized &#8220;O&#8208;down&#8221; configuration promotes charge separation, lowers the energy barrier for *CO2 &#8594; *COOH, and boosts photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency by 7.5 times.








Abstract
The precise engineering of catalytic microenvironments in single&#8208;atom site photocatalysts is critical yet challenging for optimizing CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we propose a novel strategy by leveraging the tunable molecular orientation of non&#8208;planar vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) as a &#8220;molecular switch&#8221; to dynamically modulate the local catalytic microenvironment. Positive surface charge and hydrogen bonding introduced by the hydroxylation of carbon nitride (C3N4) allows a preferential &#8220;O&#8208;down&#8221; configuration of VOPc on the modified substrate (VOPc/OH&#8208;C3N4). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that this specific molecular orientation lowers the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2&#8594;*COOH). VOPc/OH&#8208;C3N4 shows enhanced electron transfer efficiency, an upward shift of the V&#8208;centered d&#8208;band toward the Fermi level, and stabilized *COOH adsorption. Consequently, VOPc/OH&#8208;C3N4 achieves a CO evolution rate of 65.22 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, which is 7.5 times higher than that of VOPc/C3N4 with &#8220;O&#8208;up&#8221; configuration of VOPc. This work highlights that controlling the orientation of active sites presents a promising strategy for modulating interfacial electronic structures and boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Coordinated Polyvalent Aptameric System (COMPASS) Enables DC&#8208;Targeted mRNA/Mn2+ Co&#8208;Delivery for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COMPASS is a DNA&#8208;based nanoplatform that co&#8208;delivers mRNA and Mn2+ to lymph node dendritic cells. Its multivalent aptamers enable precise DC targeting, while Mn2+ coordinates structure, enhances endosomal escape, and activates STING. COMPASS elicits potent antitumor immunity comparable to commercial LNPs, but with improved safety and stability, offering a transformative platform for cancer immunotherapy. 








Abstract
mRNA vaccines hold remarkable promise for cancer immunotherapy, yet current nanoparticle systems face challenges in efficacy, dendritic cell (DC) targeting, and safety. Herein, we report a nanoplatform, Manganese&#8208;Coordinated Polyvalent Aptameric System (COMPASS), enabling targeted co&#8208;delivery of mRNA and Mn2+ to lymph node dendritic cells (DC) to boost potent antitumor immunity. The COMPASS employed rolling circle amplification to generate single&#8208;stranded DNA scaffolds with multivalent DC&#8208;targeting aptamers and polyT domains, enabling stable mRNA hybridization via A&#8208;T pairing. Various metal ions were screened, and Mn2+ was found to enhance mRNA endosomal escape and activate the STING pathway in DCs, promoting their maturation and antigen presentation. Controlled nanoparticle size (&#8764;200&#160;nm) and aptamer&#8208;mediated DC targeting markedly enhanced lymphatic accumulation. In vivo evaluations revealed that COMPASS achieved potent prophylactic and therapeutic antitumor efficacy comparable to commercial LNPs (e.g., SM&#8208;102), while exhibiting significantly enhanced safety profiles. Importantly, lyophilized COMPASS formulations retained their structural integrity and bioactivity for at least three months at room temperature. Overall, COMPASS represents a promising next&#8208;generation nanoplatform with significant translational potential for safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Selective Nucleation Control for Constructing Multi&#8208;Dimensional MOFs Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective nucleation strategy is developed to direct the growth of 2D modules on designated facets of 1D templates through systematic regulation of surface energies, enabling the efficient construction of programmable multidimensional MOF heterostructures. This versatile epitaxial platform holds great promise for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optoelectronic, and other functional applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures featuring tunable morphologies and compositions have shown great promise for applications in high&#8208;throughput sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption. Nevertheless, the precise engineering of heterogeneous architectures with multi&#8208;dimensional building units remains challenging, primarily hindered by an insufficient understanding of the growth dynamics between modules of different dimensionality. Here, we demonstrate a facet&#8208;selective epitaxial growth approach for architecting spatially defined dimensional heterostructures via crystalline plane&#8208;selective reactivity control. The intrinsically higher surface energy at the tips of 1D microrods facilitates the nucleation of 2D modules on the terminal facets, thereby yielding dumbbell&#8208;like heterostructures. Conversely, by selectively enhancing the reaction activity on the body regions of the 1D templates, preferential nucleation and growth at the central areas over the tips were effectively achieved, which enables the controlled formation of periodic modular architectures through systematic regulation of surface energies. The facet&#8208;selective epitaxial growth paradigm establishes a pathway for synthesizing hierarchical dimensional heterostructures with tailored architectures, which show great promise for applications in advanced optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems, and information encryption technologies.

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Identifies Ketogenesis&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Modifications Regulating Redox Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report ketone body induce cysteine modifications beyond lysine acylation, as revealed by integrating chemical proteomics with open&#8208;search methods. Among the modifications, cysteine crotonation (Ccr) was chemically validated by endogenous peptide&#8208;based co&#8208;elution assays. Metabolic tracing identifies BDH1 and ECHS1 as key Ccr&#8208;generating enzymes. Functional studies showed that Ccr at C229 of PRDX3 impairs dimerization and redox function.








Abstract
All the studies of ketogenesis&#8208;dependent post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), notably those mediated by ketone bodies, &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (Bhb) and acetoacetate (Acac), have focused on lysine acylations. However, given the chemically diverse and reactive nature of metabolites generated, it remains unclear whether non&#8208;lysine modifications can also happen. Here, we develop an acetoacetate&#8208;alkyne (Acac&#8208;alkyne) chemical probe that enables efficient metabolic labeling, robust fluorescent visualization, and site&#8208;specific identification of Acac&#8208;modified proteins. By combining chemical proteomics with open&#8208;search strategy, we showed that Acac induces previously uncharacterized cysteine modifications in mammalian cells. Notably, cysteine crotonation (Ccr) is validated by employing both probe&#8208;based and standard peptide&#8208;based co&#8208;elution assays. Metabolic pathway tracing further identifies BDH1 and ECHS1 as key enzymes that generate Ccr formation. We further demonstrate that Ccr at PRDX3 C229 site impairs dimerization and redox activity, linking this newly discovered modification to the regulation of cellular reactive oxygen species. Together, these findings establish ketone metabolism as a novel source of cysteine modifications and provide an alternative mechanistic pathway to explain the profound biological effects of ketone bodies.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Stable Ruthenium&#8208;Based Solid Solution for Oxygen Evolution in Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MOF&#8208;derived RuZrCoCrCeO2 solid&#8208;solution catalyst drives water oxidation through a vicinal deprotonation mechanism (VDM), where the asymmetric Ru&#8211;O&#8211;M configuration accelerates lattice oxygen&#8208;assisted deprotonation of the OOH intermediate.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis offers a promising route for green hydrogen production, yet balancing catalytic activity and durability remains challenging for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acid, particularly for non&#8208;Ir&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we develop a template&#8208;guided strategy to synthesize the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived RuZrCoCrCeO2 solid solution with tunable multi&#8208;metal heteroatom regulation. The catalyst demonstrates outstanding acidic OER performance, requiring only 179&#160;mV overpotential to achieve 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and remarkable durability over 1500&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 with a negligible decay of 30.67 &#181;V h&#8722;1. An &#8220;electronic buffer&#8221; effect facilitates electron transfer from atomically dispersed Zr to Ru, forming asymmetric Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Zr bonds with enhanced metal&#8211;oxygen covalency, thereby preventing excessive oxidation of Ru species. A vicinal deprotonation mechanism was proposed, where lattice oxygen assists *OOH deprotonation with a lower energy barrier on Ru&#9472;O&#9472;M sites. A PEM electrolyzer with low Ru loading (0.37 mgRu cm&#8722;2) achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.66&#160;V, corresponding to a low hydrogen cost of US$0.89 kg&#8722;1 below the US DOE target (US$2 per kg of H2), and operates stably for 600&#160;h at 200&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2, demonstrating its practical potential for scalable, Ir&#8208;free PEM electrolyzers.

         <title>Dynamic H&#8208;Bonding Mediates Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chiral Induction in Porous Aromatic Cages with Multicolor Chiral Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral phosphorescent porous organic cage (R/S&#8208;BA&#8208;PAC) was synthesized for the first time, and upon loading rhodamine B, the resulting composite (rhodamine B@R/S&#8208;BA&#8208;PAC) demonstrates multicolor chiral afterglow along with dynamically reversible chiral transfer in response to water/thermal stimuli, mediated by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between R/S&#8208;BA&#8208;PAC and rhodamine B.








Abstract
The origin of biological chirality remains a fundamental scientific mystery. Developing artificial systems with on&#8208;off responsive chiral induction and transfer, and elucidating their mechanisms, is of paramount importance. Here, we report the first pair of chiral porous organic cage (R/S&#8208;BA&#8208;PAC) exhibiting unprecedented chiral afterglow in a film state, boosting a remarkable lifetime of&#160;1.2&#160;s and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.001. Loading rhodamine B (RB) guest molecules enables multicolor afterglow ranging from green to red, achieving 88% energy transfer. Notably, the confined RB displays a pronounced mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism signal, and the induced chirality of RB demonstrates completely reversible on&#8208;off switching under water vapor/thermal stimulation, which is extremely rare in covalent porous materials. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the distortion of the benzoic acid moiety in RB is caused by hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between benzoic acid group and the BA&#8208;PAC. This distortion disrupts the electric&#8208;magnetic dipole moment orthogonality of RB, inducing its chirality. Furthermore, the reversible disruption and reconstruction of the host&#8211;guest hydrogen&#8208;bonding network induced by external stimuli is a key mechanism for dynamic chiral transfer. This study bridges chiral induction and stimuli response in porous cages, providing a versatile biomimetic platform for investigating molecular&#8208;level dynamic chirality transfer.

         <dc:description>
This minireview covers recent advances in the synthesis, reactivity, and metal&#8208;free catalytic uses of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs), imines (mNHIs), thiones (mNHTs), and phosphinidenes (mNHPs). 








Abstract
Transition metal compounds are widely known for their ability to activate small molecules and are excellent catalysts for a wide range of reactions. However, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternatives are highly desirable due to their toxicity and low abundance. In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the study of main&#8208;group&#8208;based species, mainly p&#8208;block element&#8208;derived compounds, which revealed reactivity resembling that of transition metal complexes. Recently, the mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (mNHCs) adducts of p&#8208;block elements, containing exocyclic fragments such as &#9552;CH2 (mNHOs), &#9552;NR (mNHIs), &#9552;PR (mNHPs), and &#9552;S (mNHTs), have evolved as ligands for coordination chemistry, reactive species for the activation of small molecules, as well as efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts for various challenging organic transformations, driven by their strong nucleophilicity. This minireview documents recent breakthroughs in the synthesis, reactivity, and catalytic applications of mNHOs, mNHIs, mNHTs, and mNHPs.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Depolymerization of Polyurethane for the Efficient Recovery of Polyol and Dianiline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable and efficient depolymerization of both model and real&#8208;life polyurethane using ZnO&#8208;tert butyl alcohol system under mild reaction conditions to diol and dianiline, which can be directly reused in the synthesis of new polyurethane, thereby achieving a closed loop recycling of polyurethane.








Abstract
Polyurethane (PU) recycling remains a significant challenge owing to its inherent stability and crosslinked nature. Conventional chemical recycling methods, including solvolysis and catalytic hydrogenation, often rely on homogeneous catalysts with limited product recoveries. Herein, we report a novel approach incorporating heterogeneous catalysis with alcoholysis, utilizing commercially available zinc oxide and tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (TBA) for the efficient depolymerization of both model and commercial PU. Through comprehensive screening of metal oxides with varied acid&#8211;base properties and structurally distinct alcohols, the ZnO&#8211;TBA system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, offering over 99% depolymerization of model PU at 180&#160;&#176;C within 4&#160;h, demonstrating high selectivity toward the desired alcohol and amine products. Based on the control reactions conducted under varied conditions and the isolation of tert&#8208;butyl carbamate intermediate, a mechanistic pathway for ZnO catalyzed alcoholysis was proposed and further validated by DFT calculations. The practical potential of this method was showcased by applying it to real&#8208;life PU materials, including foams, elastomers, and insulation materials, which resulted in high monomer recoveries. The closed&#8208;loop nature of this approach enables direct reuse of the recovered monomers for new PU synthesis, thereby advancing the field of sustainable polymer recycling through a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign, and reusable catalytic platform.

         <title>Tracking Structural and Electron Spin Density Changes in a Cooperative Mn3+ Spin Crossover Complex at Atomic Scale via Low Temperature Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin transition of a Mn(III) complex is investigated by tracking the evolution of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of individual sites under fast low&#8208;temperature magic angle spinning conditions. The proposed experimental methodology combined with ab initio calculations of the paramagnetic NMR shifts provides a unique toolbox to study the electronic structure and dynamics of spin&#8208;crossover systems at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Electron spin&#8208;state changes in transition&#8208;metal (TM) complexes underpin many biochemical processes and molecular spin&#8208;control technologies. Such transitions, triggered by external stimuli like temperature, light, or pressure, alter both the molecular structure and electron spin density (ESD) distribution. Paramagnetic NMR offers atomic&#8208;scale insights into these changes, yet traditional solution&#8208;state measurements bear limitations due to solvent effects, unaccounted lattice cooperativity, and inaccessibility at cryogenic temperatures. We overcome these limitations by extending the approach to spinning solids at cryogenic temperatures. Specifically, we report high&#8208;resolution 13C and 1H magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra of a mononuclear spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) Mn(III) complex across the SCO transition at 130&#160;K. Such low&#8208;temperature experiments are particularly challenging because paramagnetic shift and shift anisotropy are inversely proportional to the temperature. The experimental findings are supported by advanced quantum chemical calculations of the NMR and EPR parameters to assign and rationalize the observed paramagnetic shifts. Additionally, monitoring selected 1H resonances upon heating and cooling through the transition provides access to the order parameter (q=NHS&#8722;NLSNHS+NLS$q = \frac{{{N_{{\mathrm{HS}}}} - {N_{{\mathrm{LS}}}}}}{{{N_{{\mathrm{HS}}}} + {N_{{\mathrm{LS}}}}}}$), revealing hysteresis behavior similar to the magnetic susceptibility measurements. This work demonstrates that paramagnetic NMR combined with quantum chemical calculations provides a unique route to probing SCO at the atomic level.

Cooperative EnT &amp; HAT: New solution for direct C&#9472;N coupling of unactivated alkanes. Metal&#8208;free photocatalytic nitrogenation. Use of unactivated alkanes. Original reaction pathway.








Abstract
While important progress has been achieved recently on direct functionalization of alkanes via photocatalytic methods, direct amination of aliphatic compounds remains a great challenge. Herein we report a conceptually new strategy towards direct conversion of hydrocarbons into amines, based on in situ generation of nitrene radical. Energy transfer between thioxanthone (TXO) photocatalyst and iminoiodinane furnishes the triplet nitrene radical, able to undergo HAT reaction promoting alkane activation and subsequent C&#9472;N bond formation step. The user&#8208;friendly nature of the metal&#8208;free transformation, along with mild reaction conditions further highlight the sustainability of this scalable process delivering a diversity of cycloalkylamines. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support the unusual reaction mechanism.

Binuclear PtII complexes bridged by 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands exhibit strong 3MMLCT emission in the red to NIR region with emission quantum yields up to 0.87 and radiative decay rate as high as 6.69&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1. Red and near&#8208;infrared OLEDs based on these emitters as dopants have an EQEmax of 32.7%, efficiency roll&#8208;off of 2.4% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and LT95 &gt; 26&#160;250&#160;h at L0 of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Platinum(II) metal&#8211;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) emitters have high radiative decay rates and tunable emission energies but their stability under device operation conditions is a critical issue. Here we describe a new class of substituted 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine bridged binuclear PtII complexes [Pt2(R&#8208;N^O)] that display strong 3MMLCT emission in the red to NIR region with emission quantum yields up to 0.87 and radiative decay rate as high as 6.69&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1. Compared with the conventional formamidinate bridging ligand, the asymmetric N and O donor sites of the R&#8208;N^O bridging ligand can form strong Pt&#9472;N and Pt&#9472;O bonds by modulating the electron distribution on the N^O bridging ligand, thus forming a binuclear PtII complex with enhanced stability. OLEDs based on [Pt2(R&#8208;N^O)] emitters as dopants have an EQEmax of 32.7%, efficiency roll&#8208;off of 2.4% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and LT95 &gt;26&#160;200&#160;h at L0 of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The [Pt2(R&#8208;N^O)] complex&#8208;sensitized red hyper&#8208;OLEDs with CIE coordinates of (0.65, 0.35) had an FWHM of 35&#160;nm (0.11&#160;eV) and an outstanding device lifetime of LT95 &gt;23&#160;300&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The co&#8208;doped NIR OLEDs achieved an EQEmax of 17.5% at 734&#160;nm emission and excellent operational stability with LT99 value of 25&#160;873&#160;h at an initial radiance of 1000&#160;mW Sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This highlights the practical commercial application of 3MMLCT emitters in OLEDs technology.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Competing Nitrile Polymer Gel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Quasi Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrile&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with tailored solvation structure effectively suppresses side reactions at the Li metal interface. The polymer framework expels adiponitrile (ADN) from the Li&#8314; solvation shell, enabling stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and high Li&#8314; transport. This design delivers high ionic conductivity, superior interfacial stability, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance at high voltages.








Abstract
The search for Li&#8208;ion batteries offering increased energy, power, and safety has led researchers to develop solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSB) and more recently, quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) prepared by in situ polymerization to accelerate their practical implementation. A complex challenge with QSEs arises in designing polymer matrices having high ionic conductivity that are stable against oxidation, safe and scalable. Herein, we developed a novel QSE through in situ polymerization of butyl acrylate monomer in adiponitrile (ADN)&#8208;based electrolyte. Benefiting from a solvation&#8208;competing mechanism, polybutyl acrylate (PBA) expels the nitrile solvent from the Li+ solvation shell, which significantly inhibits side reactions between ADN and Li metal, thereby forming a robust solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The PBA in the QSE also contributes to an enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.87) and minimized concentration polarization. As a result, the QSE&#8208;based LCO||Li cell retains 78% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at 4.45&#160;V, along with outstanding rate performance. The excellent performance and safety are also validated in a 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell. This work provides new insights for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, safe, and practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells offering immediate promise to battery manufacturers.

         <title>Deoxygenative Difunctionalization of Aldehydes via Ketyl Radical and Light/Dark Pd Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, redox&#8208;neutral strategy enables direct deoxygenative difunctionalization of aldehydes with vinylarenes. This method delivers allylic sulfones and conjugated dienes with broad scope, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and synthetic versatility, offering a general entry to complex molecular architectures from simple carbonyl feedstocks.








Abstract
The direct deoxygenative difunctionalization of aldehydes offers a powerful yet underdeveloped strategy to convert abundant carbonyl feedstocks into structurally complex molecules. Here we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, redox&#8208;neutral platform that merges ketyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;acyloxy halides with hybrid Pd catalysis. This strategy enables aldehydes to serve as versatile C1 synthons, delivering allylic sulfones in the presence of nucleophiles and conjugated dienes in their absence. The method exhibits broad scope across diverse vinylarenes, aldehydes, and sulfonyl partners, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The synthetic utility of the products is highlighted through gram&#8208;scale reactions, regioselective SN2&#8242; substitutions to construct quaternary carbon centers, and a one&#8208;pot reductive hydrovinylation sequence. By bridging ketyl radical chemistry with hybrid Pd catalysis, this work establishes aldehyde deoxygenative difunctionalization as a new and practical entry to complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Shielded Porous Organic Cages for High&#8208;Performance Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic shielding strategy that spatially confines anions within the cage is demonstrated, achieving the successful construction of positively charged channels for Xe/Kr separation. This Xe/Kr adsorbent with organic cations employed as binding sites represents a new category of adsorbents and achieves high Xe uptake, remarkable IAST selectivity, and record&#8208;breaking dynamic selectivity among porous organic materials.








Abstract
The separation of Xe and Kr poses a significant industrial challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an anionic shielding strategy that effectively spatially confines anions within the cage's cavities, constructing unprecedented individually positively charged channel&#8208;based adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation. Building on this approach, the obtained POC&#8208;TGCl achieved high Xe uptake (75.1&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1), remarkably IAST selectivity (23.4), and a record&#8208;breaking dynamic selectivity of 15.4 among porous organic materials. These results achieve a superior trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity compared to all reported Xe&#8208;selective adsorbents. Notably, this is the first Xe/Kr adsorbent to use organic cations as binding sites, offering a new category of adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic characterizations reveal that the presence of cationic sites accounts for the high performance of POC&#8208;TGCl. Moreover, unlike conventional ionic materials that are easily affected by water and ion interference, POC&#8208;TGCl, with its hydrophobic surface and anionic shielding, can effectively prevent the competitive adsorption of water and potential ion exchanges, enabling efficient ppm&#8208;level Xe capture from nuclear waste off&#8208;gas. Our work not only develops high&#8208;performance adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation,&#160;but also provides a solution for constructing pure positively charged channels based porous materials for various application.

         <title>Taming of Low&#8208;Valent Arsenic Compounds and Transfer of Nascent As2 Facilitated by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) stabilized arsenic compounds with formal oxidation numbers at As of&#160;+1, 0, and&#160;&#8722;1 are presented. A stable FLP&#8208;chelated complex of As2 was prepared which undergoes the light&#8208;induced release of nascent diarsenic, As2nasc, which reveals clean triple&#8208;bond type reactivity with dienes and metal&#8208;metal bonds under mild conditions






.

Abstract
The first examples of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;stabilized compounds with formal oxidation states of arsenic ranging from &#8722;1 to&#160;+1 have been synthesized. These chelates include the metalated arsinidenyl As(&#9472;I) anion in FLP{As&#9472;K} (1), which provides access to the parent FLP&#8208;stabilized arsinidene, As(+I)&#9472;H, in FLP{As&#9472;H} (3), and a diatomic arsenic(0) allotrope within FLP{As&#9472;As}FLP (5). Irradiation of the As2 complex 5 represents an unprecedented method for the generation of nascent diarsenic, As2nasc, which shows triple&#8208;bond like reactivity with a diene and selective As2 unit insertion into metal&#8208;metal bonds under mild conditions.

         <title>CO/H2S Dual Prodrugs Activated by Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Chemiexcitation for Suppression of Tumor Growth and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two are better than one: We have developed a novel prodrug strategy of proximity&#8208;enhanced chemiexcitation for light&#8208;independent activation of photosensitive CO prodrugs. Remarkably, this system serendipitously achieves dual release of CO and H2S in response to H2O2. Such dual prodrugs substantially suppress tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in a murine tumor model, highlighting a promising activation mechanism for combinational gas therapy.








Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) both exhibit significant therapeutic potential in antitumor therapy, highlighting the importance of developing dual prodrugs for combinatorial gas therapy. However, such dual prodrug systems remain largely unexplored. This study designed a series of CO/H2S dual prodrugs based on a proximity&#8208;enhanced chemiexcitation mechanism. By directly conjugating a chemiexcitation&#8208;triggering module with a photosensitive CO&#8208;releasing moiety (3&#8208;hydroxythioflavone), we constructed unimolecular prodrugs capable of light&#8208;independent CO release specifically in response to H2O2. Leveraging the proximity effect between these modules, exceptional CO release efficiency exceeding 90% was achieved. Surprisingly, H2O2&#8208;induced chemiexcitation also facilitated H2S release from the 3&#8208;hydroxythioflavone scaffold. Two representative prodrugs demonstrated simultaneous CO and H2S release in 4T1 cancer cells. Notably, in a 4T1 murine tumor model, these prodrugs effectively suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis without inducing observable adverse effects. This work presents the first report of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered CO/H2S dual prodrugs, providing a promising strategy for combinatorial gas therapy in cancer treatment.

         <title>Engineering Multicellular Inter&#8208;Communication Systems Using a Synthetic Conformation Inducible Kinase Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic conformation&#8208;inducible kinase receptor (synCIKER) system is developed by engineering the extracellular domain of a receptor with ligand&#8208;responsive moieties and rewiring intracellular signaling pathways for prescribed transgene expressions. This design allows cell receptor degradation, T cell&#8208;mediated lysis, intercellular logic&#8208;gated gene editing and macrophage polarization in a multi&#8208;cellular system. 








Abstract
Synthetic multicellular inter&#8208;communication systems are essential for understanding multicellular behaviors and developing cell&#8208;based therapeutics. Synthetic receptors that allow programming of multicellular intercommunications through spatiotemporal control with light or chemical ligands are highly desirable but remain challenging. Here we propose a new strategy for designing multicellular inter&#8208;communication systems using a synthetic conformation&#8208;inducible kinase receptor (synCIKER). The synCIKER system is developed by engineering the extracellular domain of a tyrosine kinase receptor with domains responsive to inputs of chemical ligand, light or soluble protein, and rewiring the endogenous intracellular signaling pathways for prescribed transgene expression. The synCIKER system is demonstrated to sense these inputs, and generate customized secretory proteins for programming receiver cell behaviours such as surface receptor degradation and T cell&#8208;mediated lysis in target cells. We also demonstrate the ability of synCIKER to construct cascade systems and reconfigure intelligent intercellular Boolean logic gates of OR, AND and INHIBIT for activating gene editing in receiver cells. The synCIKER platform is further exploited to modulate bi&#8208;directional polarization of macrophages in a multi&#8208;cellular system, highlighting its potential for designing synthetic intercellular communication systems for programming multicellular behaviors.

A synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis was established for the asymmetric coupling VMCCs with aldimine esters. This method gave stereodivergent synthesis of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids bearing trisubstituted olefins with defined Z/E and R/S configurations. Specifically, the palladium catalyst governs the olefin configuration through ligand&#8208;directed chemoselectivity, while the copper catalyst dictates the stereochemical outcome at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of the nucleophile.








Abstract
The synthesis of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids containing trisubstituted olefins with controlled Z/E and R/S configurations represents a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a synergistic Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed approach that enables stereodivergent control over both central chirality and olefin geometry. By leveraging orthogonal catalytic cycles, this method allows for the independent and precise manipulation of these stereochemical elements within a single catalytic system. Specifically, the palladium catalyst governs the olefin configuration through ligand&#8208;directed chemoselectivity, while the copper catalyst dictates the stereochemical outcome at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of the nucleophile. This dual catalytic strategy achieves a stereodivergent synthesis of olefin&#8208;containing unnatural amino acids (UAAs), providing access to all four stereoisomers (Z/R, Z/S, E/R, E/S) through deliberate catalyst combinations.

         <title>A Label&#8208;Free Phosphate&#8208;Transfer DNAzyme for the Cost&#8208;Effective Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Detection of Influenza Virus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;transfer DNAzyme (P&#8208;Dz)&#8208;based POCT platform was developed for the accurate and low&#8208;cost detection of influenza virus by restoring P&#8208;Dz activity upon target virus RNA binding, triggering high fluorescence being facilely imaged and analyzed via smartphone.








Abstract
DNAzymes have significantly enriched the toolbox for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT); however, their inferior biostability and reliance on costly chemical labeling limit their broader applicability in high&#8208;throughput viral sample analysis. Herein, we constructed a label&#8208;free DNAzyme POCT platform for the accurate detection of influenza virus, with low cost (approximately US$0.20 per test). The simple yet robust viral detection system consists merely of a phosphate&#8208;transferase&#8208;mimicking DNAzyme (P&#8208;Dz) with a newly discovered highly&#8208;efficient small&#8208;molecule substrate, 6,8&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP). Target viral RNA could specifically restore the catalytically active conformation of P&#8208;Dz for initiating the phosphate transfer reaction from DiFMUP and for producing a high fluorescence signal. Without the prerequisite of laborious and expensive chemical labeling of DNA substrate, a readily accessible test filter strip (TFS) was introduced into the system, enabling the interpretation of fluorescence readout via smartphone visualization and thereby achieving the amplified detection of various viral RNA targets. This label&#8208;free DNAzyme platform provides a cost&#8208;effective and portable platform for bioanalysis, with considerable potential in epidemiological diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring.

         <title>Unlocking Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network&#8208;Mediated Directional Spillover Mechanism in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond network&#8208;mediated spillover mechanism was designed over Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/CoP, wherein efficiently adsorbed H* on Pt sequentially shuttles into H&#8208;bond networks, undergoes directional transport via H&#8208;bond relays, and ultimately shuttles to g&#8208;C3N4 and then to CoP for facile H2 desorption. The resulting catalysts achieved ultrahigh Pt utilization activity for hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover offers a promising route to circumvent scaling relations in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by spatially decoupling the hydrogen adsorption and desorption steps. However, its practical application has been limited by sluggish spillover kinetics across heterogeneous interfaces. In this work, we propose a hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) network&#8208;mediated spillover mechanism that bypasses conventional interfacial mediation. Within this mechanism, active hydrogen species (H*) generated on one component sequentially enter the H&#8208;bond network, undergo directional transport via Grotthuss&#8208;type H* hopping along the network, and ultimately uptake onto another component. To realize this concept, we designed a Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/CoP catalyst, in which Pt effectively enriches H* to establish a coverage gradient from Pt&#8594;g&#8208;C3N4&#8594;CoP; g&#8208;C3N4 optimizes the proximity of the H&#8208;bond network to facilitate H* shuttling and serves as H* relay sites; and CoP provides facile sites for H2 desorption. This configuration enables efficient H&#8208;bond network&#8208;mediated spillover along the Pt&#8594;g&#8208;C3N4&#8594;CoP pathway, achieving an ultrahigh Pt&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized HER activity of 175.0&#160;A mgPt&#8722;1 at&#160;&#8722;0.1&#160;V vs. RHE in acidic medium. The mechanism elucidated here opens new avenues for catalyst design in multi&#8208;step hydrogen&#8208;involving electrocatalytic processes.

Within this mechanism, active hydrogen species (H*) generated on one component sequentially enter the H-bond network, undergo directional transport via Grotthuss-type H* hopping along the network, and ultimately uptake onto another component. To realize this concept, we designed a Pt/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CoP catalyst, in which Pt effectively enriches H* to establish a coverage gradient from Pt&#8594;g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;CoP; g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; optimizes the proximity of the H-bond network to facilitate H* shuttling and serves as H* relay sites; and CoP provides facile sites for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; desorption. This configuration enables efficient H-bond network-mediated spillover along the Pt&#8594;g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;CoP pathway, achieving an ultrahigh Pt-mass-normalized HER activity of 175.0&#160;A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at&#160;&#8722;0.1&#160;V vs. RHE in acidic medium. The mechanism elucidated here opens new avenues for catalyst design in multi-step hydrogen-involving electrocatalytic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Inorganic Nitrate to Organic Nitriles by the pH Swing Effect in a Pickering Emulsion Electrocatalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the electroreduction of nitrate in a Pickering emulsion system, hydroxylamine and nitrite are periodically generated under different pH levels as a result of the pH swing effect. Hydroxylamine undergoes nucleophilic addition to aldehydes to form oximes. The generated oximes can be in situ nitrated by NO2 derived from nitrite and further undergo a spontaneous chemical conversion and hydrodeoxygenation process to form nitriles.








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia is attracting increasing attention. However, the purification and storage of low&#8208;concentration ammonia generated in electrolytes are economically inefficient. In this study, we present a novel electrochemical reduction coupling reaction that takes place within a Pickering emulsion electrocatalytic system, facilitating the transformation of NO3&#8722; and aldehydes into high&#8208;value&#8211;added nitriles. The key to this conversion lies in the pH swing effect within the catalytic system, through which hydroxylamine and NO2&#8722;, the semi&#8208;reduction products of NO3&#8722;, are generated at distinct pH levels. Hydroxylamine initially engages in a nucleophilic addition reaction with aldehydes to form aldoximes. The aldoximes were nitrated by NO2 derived from NO2&#8722; and then spontaneously converted into nitrile oxides. The nitrile oxides ultimately undergo electrocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation to yield nitriles. Aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes can be effectively transformed into corresponding nitriles. This research offers novel perspectives and valuable insights for the high&#8208;value utilization of nitrate.

         <title>Enantioselective Syntheses of Secondary Alkylboronates via Asymmetric Regioselective Reduction of 1,3&#8208;Dienylboronates</title>

         <dc:description>
We report herein the development of catalytic asymmetric synthesis of secondary alkyl boronates. Under the optimal conditions, Cu&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes forms secondary alkyl boronates with excellent regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. With H2O as the source of hydrogen, the reaction proceeds through a protoboration and protodeboration cascade reaction sequence to generate the desired boronates. By using a slightly modified protocol, the process allows for access to enantioenriched deuterium&#8208;labeled secondary alkyl boronates.

The oxoglaucine Rh(III)&#8208;nitroxyl radical complex (complex 2) represents a novel antitumor strategy that eradicates hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) synergistically through dual&#8208;targeting of metabolic sabotage and redox catalysis.








Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resists apoptosis&#8208;targeting therapies, necessitating the development of agents targeting alternative cell death pathways. Here, we report the discovery of a nitroxyl radical&#8208;conjugated Rh(III) complex (OG&#8208;Rh) that triggers dual disulfidptosis and apoptosis via synergistic metabolic sabotage and redox catalysis. OG&#8208;Rh inhibited glucose uptake, depleted NADPH, and induced disulfidptosis, a novel disulfide&#8208;stress&#8208;mediated death, by inducing actin cytoskeleton collapse via pathogenic disulfide over&#8208;crosslinking. Simultaneously, its tumor&#8208;selective superoxide dismutase/peroxidase (SOD)/(POD) mimetic activity converted endogenous O2&#8226;&#8722; and H2O2 into &#8226;OH, resulting in redox attacks that suppressed AP&#8208;1 via Mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinases (MAPK)&#8208;SIRT1 and amplified disulfide stress. This dual pathway mechanism overcomes apoptosis resistance and catalytic therapy limitations. In vitro, OG&#8208;Rh showed potent cytotoxicity (IC50&#160;=&#160;1.0 &#181;M in BEL&#8208;7402 cells) and selectivity (&gt;10&#8208;fold versus normal cells). In vivo, it suppressed tumor growth by 60.9% without systemic toxicity. This work pioneered a strategy via &#8220;metabolic sabotage&#8208;redox storm&#8221; achieved by a small&#8208;molecule metallodrug, offering a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach against refractory HCC.

         <title>Revolutionizing Quinoidal Optoelectronics Through Heterojunction Engineering for Tri&#8208;Modal Reconfigurability Wide&#8208;Spectral Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type&#8208;II heterojunction phototransistor is developed by integrating an n&#8208;type quinoidal small molecule with a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. This design exploits complementary absorption and efficient intermolecular charge transfer, enabling wide&#8208;spectral detection (300&#8211;1200&#160;nm) with a low detection threshold (3&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2) and fast response (20&#160;ms). The tri&#8208;modal reconfigurability and gate&#8208;tunable photoconductivity support high&#8208;contrast imaging and secure optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Quinoidal&#8208;conjugated materials are notable for their ultra&#8208;low LUMO levels (&lt;&#8722;4.0&#160;eV) and exceptional wide&#8208;spectral absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region, attributed to their narrow optical bandgaps. However, their inferior charge transport properties hinder the simultaneous optimization of light absorption and carrier mobility, thereby limiting performance in detection sensitivity and response speed across the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR range. To address this challenge, we developed a novel heterojunction architecture phototransistor combining a new n&#8208;type quinoidal small molecule (Q4T) with a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor (C10&#8208;DNTT). Leveraging the complementary absorption of heterogeneous semiconductors and efficient intermolecular charge transfer in type&#8208;II heterojunctions, the phototransistor enables wide&#8208;spectral detection from 300 to 1200&#160;nm. It demonstrates tri&#8208;modal operational reconfigurability, offering versatile photoresponse characteristics. Remarkably, the device exhibits a low detection threshold of 3&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2, underscoring its high sensitivity. Additionally, the optimized heterostructure ensures a fast response time of 20&#160;ms, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications. The integration of spectrally resolved positive/negative photoconductivity with gate&#8208;tunable operation modes enables high&#8208;contrast image sensing and secure information encryption/decryption. This heterojunction strategy effectively addresses the inherent limitations of quinoidal semiconductors and establishes a versatile platform for all&#8208;organic bidirectional optoelectronic systems, offering promising prospects for intelligent spectral sensing technologies.

Additionally, the optimized heterostructure ensures a fast response time of 20&#160;ms, making it a promising candidate for high-performance optoelectronic applications. The integration of spectrally resolved positive/negative photoconductivity with gate-tunable operation modes enables high-contrast image sensing and secure information encryption/decryption. This heterojunction strategy effectively addresses the inherent limitations of quinoidal semiconductors and establishes a versatile platform for all-organic bidirectional optoelectronic systems, offering promising prospects for intelligent spectral sensing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ir/TiO2 Heterojunctions with in Situ Defects and Surface Plasmon Resonance: Chloride&#8208;Resistant Catalyst for the Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)&#8208;induced hot electrons in Ir nanoclusters undergo directional transfer to the (101) facets of TiO2, in situ generating Ti3+ defects. The selective adsorption of H+/OH&#8211; by Ir0, Ir&#948;+, and Ti3+ sites avoids Cl corrosion, and the elevated local electrolyte temperature in simulated seawater compared with that in pure water accelerates photochemical reaction rates, collectively enhancing photocatalytic seawater splitting activity in simulated seawater.








Abstract
Photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production emerges as a promising sustainable approach to alleviate energy crises and global warming. However, its practical application is critically hindered by Cl&#8211;&#8208;induced catalyst corrosion and poor long&#8208;term stability under harsh high&#8208;salt conditions. Herein, we report a rationally designed photocatalyst comprising Ir nanoclusters uniformly dispersed on the (101) facets of a mesoporous TiO2 matrix. This design in situ introduces Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies within the TiO2 lattice to extend light absorption. The surface plasmon resonance effect of Ir nanoclusters promotes efficient charge separation at the Ir/TiO2 heterojunction, suppressing carrier recombination and boosting the utilization efficiency of photocarriers. Moreover, the Ir active sites demonstrate preferential coordination with H+/OH&#8211; species through coordination competition, reducing the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction, mitigating the competitive chloride oxidation reaction, and ensuring exceptional catalytic stability. Under full&#8208;spectrum light illumination, the 1% Ir/TiO2 catalyst achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 0.46&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 (46.00&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with a remarkable turnover frequency of 1163.38 h&#8722;1. This work establishes an effective strategy for constructing TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts featuring low noble metal loading, robust Cl&#8211; corrosion resistance, and outstanding photocatalytic activity under harsh high&#8208;salt environments, offering a cost&#8208;effective route toward direct solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production from seawater.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Responsive Coacervates Through Controlled Self&#8208;Immolative Demembranization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiation&#8208;responsive coacervates constructed by self&#8208;immolative polymer (SIP) membranes achieve controlled demembranation upon radiation. These SIP&#8208;membranized coacervates possess anti&#8208;fusion capabilities, with their fusion properties activated in response to radiation. Through regulating the diffusion barrier of enzyme cascade reactions, enzyme kinetics can be regulated. As synthetic organelles in living cells, SIP&#8208;membranized coacervates can regulate nitric oxide production and enhance cancer cell cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Coacervates formed through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been utilized to emulate the dynamic organization of membraneless organelles in biological systems. These structures exhibit broad application prospects in biomedicine, especially as microreactors for biochemical reactions. However, membraneless coacervates tend to coalesce easily in ambient condition and lack the ability to achieve precise, stimulus&#8208;responsive release, which presents significant challenges for their biomedical applications. To address this, we developed a self&#8208;immolative polymer (SIP)&#8208;membranized coacervates to tune enzyme cascade kinetics using radiotherapeutic &#947;&#8208;ray. The SIP&#8208;membranized coacervates exhibited enhanced kinetic stability and fusion&#8208;resistance. When exposed to radiation, the SIP membrane undergoes depolymerization, resulting in increased fluidity and enhanced transmembrane transport. This, in turn, regulated enzyme cascade reactions within the coacervates. Specifically, we used radiation&#8208;responsive coacervates to precisely modulate the generation of NO in living cells and exploited NO&#8208;mediated radiosensitization to enhance cytotoxicity. Our findings advance the development of radiation&#8208;responsive LLPS constructs, and pave the way for innovative applications in cellular bioengineering, and combined radio&#8208;chemotherapy.

         <title>Orbital Hybridization at Au&#8208;O&#8208;Zr Interface Promotes Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Cluster Catalysis for Durable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital&#8208;level electronic coupling between atomically dispersed Au single atoms and sub&#8208;nanometer clusters on ZrO2 induces significant O 2p&#8211;Zr 4d orbital hybridization, which optimizes the adsorption energetics of oxygen intermediates and simultaneously enhances both ORR and OER kinetics. The strong metal&#8211;support interaction further stabilizes the dual&#8208;active&#8208;site structure, enabling a Zn&#8211;air battery with exceptional cycling durability over 260 h and a record round&#8208;trip efficiency of 71.07%, surpassing all noble&#8208;metal benchmarks in power density and operational stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are fundamentally limited by the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen electrocatalysis, primarily due to the high surface energy and aggregation tendency of isolated metal atoms. Herein, we develop a low&#8208;temperature (200&#160;&#176;C) in situ thermal anchoring strategy to construct a hybrid Au catalyst (Au ACSA&#8211;ZrO2) comprising atomically dispersed Au single atoms and clusters stabilized on ZrO2 nanoparticles. This mild yet effective process induces strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI), leading to the formation of covalent Au&#8208;O&#8208;Zr interfacial bonds. These bonds effectively inhibit atomic migration and coalescence while simultaneously promoting interfacial charge transfer. Electronic coupling between Au single atoms and adjacent clusters induces significant hybridization between O 2p and Zr 4d orbitals, which modulates the local coordination environment and optimizes the adsorption energetics of oxygenated intermediates, thereby accelerating both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics. When applied in a Zn&#8211;air battery, this dual&#8208;site catalyst exhibits exceptional durability with 71.07% round&#8208;trip efficiency and negligible decay over 260&#160;h of continuous cycling, demonstrating that precise orbital interaction, achievable even at low synthesis temperatures, is crucial for high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalysis.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Impelled NIR Cyanine Dyes in Situ Generation Enabled Zero&#8208;Background Fluorescence Imaging and Precise Surgical Tumor Excision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a &#8220;zero&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence imaging strategy, which utilizes endogenous hydroxyl radicals in ferroptosis to catalyze the in situ synthesis of NIR cyanines through dimerization of monomers, enabling precise quantification and high&#8208;contrast imaging of sub&#8208;organelle hydroxyl radicals and subsequent precise surgical tumor excision.








Abstract
The diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence imaging enabled lesion site visualization and pathological biomarker quantification is often compromised by non&#8208;specific probe activation and &#8220;high&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence interference, which contribute to false&#8208;positive signals and reduced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, ultimately limiting clinical reliability. Herein, we propose a &#8220;zero&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence imaging strategy for precise quantification and evaluation of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) levels in sorafenib&#8208;provoked ferroptotic tumor. This study utilizes endogenous &#183;OH generated during tumorous ferroptosis as biocatalyst, triggering the heterogenous dimerization of monomers for directly in&#8208;situ formulating near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive cyanine dyes. The octadecyl&#8208;substituted monomer (Cy420) demonstrated morphological variations from orbicular to square nano&#8208;assemblies modulated with serum albumin and realized the targeted and prolonged retention in tumors facilitated with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Crucially, the in situ generated NIR dye (mCy849) forms a shielding effect via hydrophobic bis&#8208;octadecyl chain&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, thus resisting molecular oxidation and ensuring quantification accuracy. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that Cy420 enables accurate zero&#8208;background NIR imaging in sorafenib&#8208;administrated xenograft hepatic tumor, with significantly enhanced tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR 13.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.74) at 72&#160;h, competently empowered NIR fluorescence&#8208;navigated precise tumor resection. Our strategy has provided a new paradigm for chemotherapy&#8208;imaging synergistic regulation of tumors with authentic &#8220;zero&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence.

This study utilizes endogenous &#183;OH generated during tumorous ferroptosis as biocatalyst, triggering the heterogenous dimerization of monomers for directly in-situ formulating near-infrared (NIR) emissive cyanine dyes. The octadecyl-substituted monomer (Cy420) demonstrated morphological variations from orbicular to square nano-assemblies modulated with serum albumin and realized the targeted and prolonged retention in tumors facilitated with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Crucially, the in situ generated NIR dye (mCy849) forms a shielding effect via hydrophobic bis-octadecyl chain-driven self-assembly, thus resisting molecular oxidation and ensuring quantification accuracy. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that Cy420 enables accurate zero-background NIR imaging in sorafenib-administrated xenograft hepatic tumor, with significantly enhanced tumor-to-background ratio (TBR 13.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.74) at 72&#160;h, competently empowered NIR fluorescence-navigated precise tumor resection. Our strategy has provided a new paradigm for chemotherapy-imaging synergistic regulation of tumors with authentic &#8220;zero-background&#8221; fluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionizable Nano&#8208;PROTAC Overcomes Endosomal Entrapment for Enhanced LRG1 Degradation and Tumor Suppression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionizable nano&#8208;PROTACs i16&#8208;ELNC incorporate pH&#8208;responsive tertiary amines that boost cellular uptake and facilitate proton&#8208;sponge&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, enabling efficient cytosolic delivery for LRG1 degradation. This approach overcomes endosomal entrapment, resulting in significant tumor regression with minimal systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Nanoscale proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) have emerged as a promising modality that circumvents conventional linker optimization using multivalent engineering. However, their therapeutic potential remains severely limited by inefficient cytosolic delivery caused by endosomal entrapment. To address this challenge, we integrated a tertiary&#8208;amine motif into amphiphilic conjugates, which co&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208;PROTACs (designed as i16&#8208;ETNC) optimized for protein degradation. Mechanistically, i16&#8208;ETNC exploits a synergistic dual mechanism in which the ionizable tertiary amine cooperates with a C16 hydrophobic tail to enhance cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape via proton sponge effects, enabling efficient delivery to the cytosol. This design achieves potent degradation of the oncogenic target leucine&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) in 4T1 murine breast tumors. Systematic evaluation shows that i16&#8208;ETNC effectively induces LRG1 degradation, leading to significant tumor growth inhibition, strong apoptosis induction, and notable tumor regression, all without detectable systemic toxicity. Overall, this study presents a broadly applicable strategy to address endosomal entrapment in targeted protein degradation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of nano&#8208;PROTACs.

         <title>Spatially Separated C&#8211;C Coupling and Protonation on Cl&#8208;Bridged Ti&#8211;Ag Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

Cl&#8208;bridged Ti&#9472;Ag dual&#8208;site (Ti&#9472;Cl&#9472;Ag) catalysts enable photocatalytic efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion via spatially separating C&#9472;C bond formation and active hydrogen generation: Ti sites adsorb and activate CO2/*CO, single&#8208;atom Ag accelerates H2O dissociation to supply active hydrogen, whereas the Cl separates Ti&#8211;Ag dual sites spatially to make *CO dimerization thermodynamically favorable than deep hydrogenation in the crucial step.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective reduction of CO2 to C2H4 conversion is bottlenecked by the concurrent demands for intermediate protonation and C&#8211;C coupling. Herein, we constructed a chlorine (Cl)&#8208;bridged Ti&#8211;Ag dual&#8208;site catalysts to overcome above issues. The introduction of Cl on Ti&#8208;Ag dual sites spatially separates C&#8211;C coupling and intermediate protonation, making *CO dimerization thermodynamically more favorable than *CO hydrogenation. In situ characterization and DFT calculations reveal that the Cl enables the Ti sites within the Ti&#9472;Cl&#9472;Ag configuration act as active center for CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling, thereby increasing the *CO intermediate concentration and lowering the C&#8211;C coupling energy barrier. Concurrently, Ag sites preferentially catalyze H2O dissociation, providing active hydrogen for the subsequent protonation of *OCCO intermediates, thus increasing the overall C2H4 formation rate. The optimized Ti&#9472;Cl&#9472;Ag catalysts achieve high C2H4 production rate of 244 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 64.3% selectivity, outperforming O&#8208;bridged Ti&#8211;Ag catalysts which mainly favor *CO deep hydrogenation. This work establishes spatially separated Ti&#8211;Ag dual sites that orchestrates site&#8208;specific C&#8211;C coupling and active hydrogen feeding, providing a rational design concept of photocatalysts for selective reduction of CO2 to C2H4.

         <title>First&#8208;Order Phase Transformation in Highly Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupled with optimized Zn2+ solvation structures, concentrated electrolytes unlock a paradigm shift in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries by triggering a first&#8208;order phase transformation in VS4 cathodes, replacing conventional conversion reactions observed in regular dilute systems. This structural evolution from monoclinic to hexagonal phases establishes semi&#8208;coherent phase boundaries that minimize chemical strain, thereby enhancing energy efficiency.








Abstract
Concentrated electrolyte offers a promising approach to enhance aqueous batteries, yet its influence on electrode phase transformations and mechanical properties remains largely unknown. This work shows that salt&#8208;concentrated electrolyte induces a first&#8208;order phase transformation, rather than the conventional conversion reaction of VS4 cathode typically observed in dilute electrolyte. This transformation results in a semi&#8208;coherent phase boundary, reducing strain and improving energy efficiency. As a result, capacity doubles and cycle life increase sixty&#8208;fold compared to regular dilute electrolyte. The first&#8208;order phase transformation is attributed to reduced de&#8208;solvation energy and charge transfer energy barrier due to different Zn2+ solvation structure in the concentrated electrolyte. Our findings offer groundbreaking insights into the microstructure evolution of electrode in concentrated electrolyte and pave the way to further develop batteries with excellent performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of H&#8208;Phosphinamidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective (up to 99% ee) synthesis of H&#8208;phosphinamidates via an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkynylation is reported. The resulting enantioenriched H&#8208;phosphinamidates are configurationally stable and ambiphilic, enabling diverse stereospecific P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N, P&#8211;O, and P&#8211;S transformations, and establishing them as a general and versatile platform for P(V)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks. 








Abstract
Enantioenriched heteroatom&#8208;containing H&#8208;phosphoryl compounds unite a nucleophilic H&#8211;P(O) moiety with an electrophilic, substitutable heteroatom group, endowing them with inherent ambiphilicity and making them powerful platforms for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules&#8212;structures of growing significance in asymmetric synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Yet their enantioselective synthesis has remained a significant challenge. Here we report the first highly enantioselective synthesis of H&#8208;phosphinamidates. These bifunctional, configurationally stable compounds enable stereospecific H&#8211;P(O) transformations to access diverse P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N, P&#8211;O, and P&#8211;S linkages, while the amino group offers an orthogonal handle for secondary derivatization. These reactivity features establish H&#8208;phosphinamidates as a versatile and general platform for the modular synthesis of structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Engineering Anionic Aggregation in Dilute Electrolyte for High Performance Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a dilute (0.5 M) high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HE&#8208;THF) engineered with anionic aggregation for layered oxide cathodes. It enables the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich, dense cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) via anion&#8208;derived &#8220;clusters&#8221;. Successful application in a NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 (NaNMF) cathode showcased enhanced cycling stability and broad temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered increasing attention due to their distinctive advantages. However, they still confront a series of technical challenges, particularly in cycle stability and energy density. Notably, layered oxide cathode materials experience irreversible structural changes during electrochemical processes, which significantly hinders SIBs from achieving their theoretical metrics. Here, we developed a dilute 0.5&#160;M high&#8208;entropy electrolyte. Remarkably, despite its low salt concentration, this electrolyte features an anion&#8208;rich solvation sheath and forms distinctive &#8220;clusters&#8221;, facilitating the creation of an inorganic&#8208;rich and dense cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This CEI layer effectively passivates the electrode and prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation. Importantly, the high&#8208;entropy dilute electrolyte enables the layered oxide cathode NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 (NaNMF) to maintain an excellent capacity retention of 90% after 250 cycles and exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance at both high and low temperatures. The innovative structural design of anionic aggregates in dilute high&#8208;entropy electrolytes represents a pivotal advancement, offering substantial promise for the development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SIBs in the future.

         <title>Proton Transfer&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Network for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy integrating co&#8208;adsorbed self&#8208;assembled monolayer and phenylguanidine carbonate additive simultaneously resolves poor SAM substrate quality and inherent bulk defects in perovskite films, enabling inverted perovskite solar cells with 26.65% efficiency and enhanced operational stability.








Abstract
The development and application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) has revolutionized the advancement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the performance of inverted PSCs remains limited by intrinsic defects in perovskite thin films, primarily due to inadequate control over crystallization on the poor&#8208;quality SAM substrates. Here, we reported a proton transfer&#8208;hydrogen bond network using a multifunctional additive phenylguanidine carbonate over a co&#8208;adsorbed SAM (Co&#8208;SAM) system. This strategy promoted the formation of guanidinium&#8208;formamidinium hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes, which stabilize intermediate phases, suppress the generation of impurity phases during nucleation and accelerate the transition from &#948;&#8208;phase to &#945;&#8208;phase. The significantly delayed crystallization process successfully induced large perovskite grains with suppressed intrinsic defects. Moreover, a high coverage, uniformity, and dense molecular packing was achieved for the Co&#8208;SAM, ensuring an excellent growth substrate for subsequent perovskite deposition. PSCs ultimately achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, with enhanced operational stability&#8208;retaining 92.5% of initial PCE after&#160;&gt;1200 h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>d&#8208;&#960; Coupling Effect for the Positive&#8208;Valent Electrochemical Reaction Acceleration in Organic Chalcogenide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique d&#8208;&#960; coupling structure of ferrocene, in which an iron center is sandwiched between cyclopentadienyl rings, functions as a dynamic charge&#8208;regulation platform that concurrently enhances both oxidation (S0&#8208;Se0&#8594;S+&#8208;Se+) and reduction (S0&#8208;Se0&#8594;S2&#8722;&#8208;Se2&#8722;) processes. This structural feature effectively overcomes the kinetic limitations typically associated with multivalent electrochemical reactions.








Abstract
By multi&#8208;electron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, chalcogen cathodes are expected to achieve a multifold increase in capacity. Although the strategy of organic chalcogenide cathodes can promote the positive&#8208;valent state conversion of chalcogens, its slow kinetics severely hinder its application in practical electrochemical systems. In this study, we utilize the d&#8208;&#960;coupling effect of Fe&#8208;organic framework compounds to promote the electronic structure adjustment of chalcogens, improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics in multiple&#8208;valence states. The Fe center employs the conjugated system to mediate charge adsorption and compensation on chalcogens during electrochemical reactions. This process enhances reaction kinetics and improves the reversibility of valence transitions. As revealed by experimental characterization and theoretical simulations, the ferrocene&#8208;chalcogenide compound (Fc&#8211;S&#8211;Se) enables a three&#8208;electron transfer process, facilitated by the redox coupling between S+/Se+&#8594;S0/Se0 and S0/Se0&#8594;S2&#8722;/Se2&#8722;. The results show that the Fc&#8211;S&#8211;Se electrode demonstrates greater utilization of oxidation states (approximately 3 electrons transferred) and better rate performance (1400 and 391 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 1 A g&#8722;1). It achieves an initial capacity of 1400 mAh g&#8722;1 (0.1 A g&#8722;1), approximately 3.3 times that of sulfoselenides (S&#8211;Se) (475 mAh g&#8722;1). This discovery can inspire further exploration of multivalence active site engineering for developing advanced battery cathodes.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering of Hollow Spheres of Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Boron Capture from Brine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain engineering enables covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to undergo dynamic reconstruction, synergistically embedding polyol groups and advancing structural ordering. The resulting HSPCOF (hollow, stable, and polyol&#8208;functionalized COF) features uniform hollow particles and high surface area, achieving 150 mg&#160;g&#8722;1 adsorption at 298&#160;K within 180&#160;min, with outstanding adsorption performance even in complex Salt Lake brines.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold grand promise in chemical separations owing to their tunable pore architectures and rich functionalities. However, their practical efficacy is often plagued by disordered stacking and restricted accessibility of functional groups. In this study, we present a side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, which synergistically manipulates pore&#8208;wall functionalization, dynamic structural reconstruction, and bond stabilization, to fabricate hollow, stable, and polyol&#8208;functionalized COFs (HSPCOF) adsorbents for high&#8208;efficiency capture of boron from brine. For the first time, we demonstrate that side&#8208;chain&#8208;engineering can be employed to introduce polyol groups, enabling boron chelation while concurrently enhancing the crystallinity of COFs. The resultant HSPCOF exhibits a high specific surface area, interconnected channels, and exceptional boron adsorption capacity of 150.05&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K, within 180&#160;min, 10.29&#8208;fold higher than commercial resin MK51. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the HSPCOF preferentially binds borate anions via bidentate cyclic ester formation with polyol groups, affording strong affinity and high selectivity. Remarkably, HSPCOF maintains robust borate anion adsorption performance in harsh Salt Lake brine, achieving 848.79&#160;mg g&#8722;1 capacity and 91.51% removal efficiency, validating its practical utility. This work affords generic guidelines for designing crystal and functionally precise COF materials by side&#8208;chain engineering.

         <title>Cooperative Auvertex&#8211;Aushoulder Pair Sites of Biicosahedral Au25 Cluster for Highly Oxidative Carbonylation of Diamine to Cyclic Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports that the [Au25(PPh3)10(SCH2CH2Ph)5Cl2]2+ cluster in the library of metal clusters is unique for the oxidative carbonylation of diamine, in which the apical Cl exchange and phosphine dissociation expose adjacent Auvertex and Aushoulder sites that provide access to diamine and CO and activate oxygen molecules into singlet oxygen, thereby achieving a complete selectivity for cyclic urea.








Abstract
The realization of target reactants completely transformed on the designed active sites toward desired products remains a challenge. Here, we report that the [Au25(PPh3)10(SCH2CH2Ph)5Cl2]2+ cluster in the library of metal clusters is unique for the oxidative carbonylation of diamine to cyclic urea. Our studies reveal that the ligand on&#8211;off dynamics in the presence of solvent coupled with diamine can invoke the active function of the vertex and shoulder Au of the [Au25(PPh3)10(SCH2CH2Ph)5Cl2]2+, i.e., that is respectively capped by Cl and PPh3. Notably, the transient exposed Auvertex&#8211;Aushoulder neighboring sites exhibit a selective recognition to reaction molecules, leading to the interdependent and stepwise reactivity for the oxidative carbonylation of diamine with CO and O2. The diamine is preferentially adsorbed on the Aushoulder site, with the CO inserting sequentially into the diamine to produce the key intermediate containing the secondary amide group, and meanwhile the Auvertex site engages in converting O2 to singlet oxygen and finally enables the H&#8208;atom abstraction from the amine group of the above intermediate, thereby achieving an exclusive selectivity for cyclic urea. This work provides an alternative route for the efficient carbonylation upgrading of diamine, typically distinguished from homogeneous organometallic complexes and heterogeneous supported metal catalysts.

In the Research Article (e202519101), Tengfei Yan, Ofer Reany, Junqiu Liu, and co&#8208;workers present a reversible, light&#8208;controlled ON/OFF chloride channel based on azobenzene&#8208;functionalized semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils. These biomimetic systems achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive chloride transport through photoisomerization, demonstrating unprecedented controllability in both liposomal membranes and living cells. The (E)&#8208;isomer selectively enables chloride flux, induces significant mitochondrial and lysosomal disruption, and promotes apoptosis in cancer cells, while the (Z)&#8208;isomer remains inactive.

Atomic layer deposition builds up solids in individual atomic steps by a cyclic repetition of successive surface reactions. In the Communication (e13903) by Julien Bachmann and co&#8208;workers this approach is adapted to form high&#8208;quality halide perovskite thin films from dissolved precursors. Pivalate ligands solubilize lead ions and deliver them to the surface, enabling rapid, controlled film growth. In situ investigations capture the moment of nucleation in the process of forming the semiconductor.

         <title>The Redox Properties of Polyphenols and Their Role in ROS Generation for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual redox nature of polyphenols enables antioxidant activity and controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This review details the biomedical applications of polyphenols in materials such as nanoparticles, coatings, and hydrogels for antimicrobial, tissue regeneration, and cancer therapies. Sources, clinical translation challenges, and future directions, including artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced delivery systems, are also discussed. 








Abstract
Polyphenols, particularly catechols, represent a significant class of compounds characterized by their versatile physicochemical and biological properties, sourced from both natural origins and industrial by&#8208;products. This review highlights their critical redox properties, which enable both antioxidant activity and controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These dual capacities underpin their diverse biomedical applications, including the development of materials like nanoparticles, hydrogels, bioadhesives, coatings, and membranes. The review explores their utility in areas such as antimicrobial strategies, advanced cancer therapy, and tissue regeneration, demonstrating how their ROS modulation drives therapeutic effects. Despite promising preclinical studies, significant challenges persist in clinical translation, encompassing pharmacokinetics, biosafety, regulatory pathways, and manufacturing consistency. Future perspectives emphasize the crucial need for deeper understanding and precise control of ROS dynamics, advanced delivery systems, rational material design, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate research and clinical validation. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current state, challenges, and future directions for polyphenol&#8208;based biomedical materials.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermal Coupling Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;thermal coupling catalysis, which synergistically applies electrical and thermal energy, can overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers inherent in traditional thermocatalytic and electrochemical reactions. This interdisciplinary field offers a novel development pathway for sustainable processes and opens up unique opportunities for innovative catalytic technologies.








Abstract
The chemical industry serves as a cornerstone of modern societal development, yet it is also associated with substantial energy consumption and high emissions. Electro&#8208;thermal coupling catalysis, an emerging frontier at the intersection of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, offers a promising solution. The coupling of electrocatalytic reactions can solve the problems of slow reaction rates, substrate deactivation of catalysts, and difficult separation of products, and overcome thermodynamic and kinetic barriers inherent to traditional thermocatalytical reactions. This minireview highlights the state of the art in electro&#8208;thermal coupling catalysis and the significant applications for nitrogen fixation, propane dehydrogenation, alcohol reforming, and methane and carbon dioxide conversion. Furthermore, we discuss the key challenges and future prospects that these integrated systems must address to advance toward technological maturation and commercial implementation, with the aim of providing insights for the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable chemical processes.

         <title>Turning Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles Into Ferromagnetic at Room Temperature via Molecular Functionalization for Magnetic Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

Chemically sculpted CoFe2O4 nanomagnets, achieved through molecular functionalization, exhibit enhanced magnetic order&#8212;unlocking new routes to tunable nanoscale ferromagnetism for magnetic memory applications.








Abstract
Molecular functionalization of magnetic oxide nanoparticles presents a powerful strategy for interfacial engineering, enabling the emergence of exotic magnetic phenomena. While non&#8208;covalent approaches have been widely explored, they often fail to provide robust interfaces for real applications. We report here covalent surface modification of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles (NPs) using a series of judiciously selected aryl diazonium salts to achieve a higher degree of surface functionalization and strong interfacial electronic coupling. This modification establishes robust carbon&#8211;metal (C&#8211;M) covalent bonds at the nanoparticle&#8211;molecule interface, conferring chemical stability and tunable magnetic properties. Notably, &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aryl compounds transform pristine superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 NPs into room&#8208;temperature ferromagnets, with a significant increase in coercivity, remanent magnetization, and saturation magnetization, attributed to enhanced surface spin ordering on different sublattices and elevated effective anisotropy. Zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled and field&#8208;cooled magnetization measurements reveal elevated blocking (Tb) and irreversibility (Tirr) temperatures, further confirmed by thermoremanent magnetization, with Tb rising from 245.9&#160;K in pristine NPs to 336.8&#160;K in aryl&#8208;functionalized&#8208;CoFe2O4 NPs. Molecular&#8208;level modeling further supports the origin of ferromagnetism in aryl&#8208;functionalized&#8208;CoFe2O4 NPs. Chemical functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles offers a versatile strategy to tune the magnetic properties of pristine nanoparticles for applications in spintronics, spin&#8208;based memory, and spin logic.

         <title>Harnessing Solar Energy, Extending Storage, and Accelerated Release in &#8220;Twisted&#8221; Negative Photochromic Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report twisted (hetero)arylazonaphthalene derivatives exhibiting negative photochromism, sunlight&#8208;induced photon energy conversion through E&#8208;Z photoswitching in neutral and acidic media, extended storage through neutralization, and accelerated Z&#8208;E isomerization through strong acid, or triplet sensitization, useful for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage materials. 








Abstract
We present a series of twisted (hetero)arylazonaphthalene derivatives exhibiting negative photochromism, sunlight&#8208;induced E&#8208;Z photoisomerization, and stimuli&#8208;responsive accelerated Z&#8208;E isomerization, toward the storage and release of energy in molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage materials. Through structural evidence from XRD studies and structure&#8208;property relationships, we envisaged that the geometrical azo&#8208;twist governs the negative photochromism. The salient features of these derivatives include superior sunlight&#8208;driven photoswitching and tuneable thermal half&#8208;lives (t1/2) of Z isomers (days to seconds) even under an acidic medium, and the Z&#8208;E isomerization under triplet photosensitization conditions, exemplifying multi&#8208;mode activation of catalytic Z&#8208;E relaxations on demand. Remarkably, a thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix encapsulating these targets not only retains the photoswitching behavior but also shows sensitivity toward acids and bases. More importantly, the combination of sunlight&#8208;driven forward E&#8208;Z photoisomerization (charging) in acidic medium, storage (&#916;Hiso up to 35&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1), subsequent neutralization to extend the cis isomer's half&#8208;life, and the accelerated reverse Z&#8208;E isomerization (discharging) of these targets sheds new light on the development of MOST materials. Overall, the design of these azo compounds, their characteristics, and ease of functionalization, while retaining their features, render them suitable for applications in various domains.

Sensing that the air&#8211;organic&#8211;water interface is salt&#8208;depleted using azide monolayers, extending the stratified salt hypothesis beyond neat interfaces. 








Abstract
Understanding ionic behavior at aqueous interfaces is vital to fields spanning environmental chemistry, microdroplet reactivity, and electrochemical systems. Yet, whether ions accumulate or are depleted at aqueous boundaries remains debated. Using an uncharged, surface&#8208;anchored azide probe, we find that even at 5&#160;M salt concentrations, the air&#8211;organic&#8211;water interface is depleted of small, inorganic ions, contrasting pronounced effects in bulk. Only under water&#8208;in&#8208;salt conditions (&gt;10&#160;M ZnCl2) does evidence of direct cation coordination emerge at the interface. These findings extend the stratified salt model to the air&#8211;organic&#8211;water interface and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into interfacial reactivity, ion partitioning, and &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; transformations.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Structural Evolution of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product IDO1 Inhibitors and Degraders</title>

The combination of bicyclic monoterpene&#8208; and pyrrolidine&#8208;alkaloid fragments yields novel pseudo&#8208;natural products. Biological characterization revealed that these iDegs are inhibitors and degraders of indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase.








Abstract
Terpenoid alkaloids are derived from the fusion of structurally diverse terpenoid&#8208; and alkaloid moieties. The biologically relevant chemical space defined by this unique natural product (NP) class may be explored beyond the limitations of biosynthetic pathways by means of the pseudo natural product (PNP) principle, i.e., by combination of NP fragments in different arrangements. We describe the design, synthesis and structural evolution of a monoterpene&#8211;pyrrolidine PNP collection obtained by functionalization and combination of bicyclic monoterpenes with pyrrolidine alkaloid&#8208;derived fragments. Diverse fusion strategies led to the discovery of (&#8208;)&#8208;myrtenal&#8208;pyrrolidine PNPs that are indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors and degraders, termed iDegs. Structural fine&#8208;tuning modulated both degradation and inhibition potencies. Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that iDegs induce unprecedented changes in the C&#8208;terminus of IDO1 which promote degradation. iDegs inhibited tumor growth in SKOV&#8208;3 tumor&#8208;bearing mice and led to prolonged survival, which promises to inspire novel medicinal chemistry programs aimed at IDO1 in different diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Terpenoid alkaloids are derived from the fusion of structurally diverse terpenoid- and alkaloid moieties. The biologically relevant chemical space defined by this unique natural product (NP) class may be explored beyond the limitations of biosynthetic pathways by means of the pseudo natural product (PNP) principle, i.e., by combination of NP fragments in different arrangements. We describe the design, synthesis and structural evolution of a monoterpene&#8211;pyrrolidine PNP collection obtained by functionalization and combination of bicyclic monoterpenes with pyrrolidine alkaloid-derived fragments. Diverse fusion strategies led to the discovery of (-)-myrtenal-pyrrolidine PNPs that are indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors and degraders, termed iDegs. Structural fine-tuning modulated both degradation and inhibition potencies. Co-crystallization revealed that iDegs induce unprecedented changes in the C-terminus of IDO1 which promote degradation. iDegs inhibited tumor growth in SKOV-3 tumor-bearing mice and led to prolonged survival, which promises to inspire novel medicinal chemistry programs aimed at IDO1 in different diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Spatial Visual Proteomics Enabled by Single&#8208;Cell&#8208;Type Proximity Biotinylation and Signaling Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;catalyzed proximity proteomics approach using orthogonally engineered trifunctional probes that simultaneously enable HRP&#8208;mediated radical labeling, single&#8208;cell&#8208;type fluorescence imaging, and biotin&#8208;driven proteome capture within the same tissue section. Our strategy provides a robust platform for single&#8208;cell&#8208;type profiling and proteomic discovery in clinical pathology research.








Abstract
Mapping the spatial proteome signature within heterogeneous tissue microenvironment of clinical specimens offers unique insights into both physiological and pathological molecular phenotypes. However, to simultaneously visualize and discover these spatial proteome features is challenging. Herein, we introduce spatial visual proteomics (SVPro) which integrates single&#8208;cell proximity biotinylation coupled with fluorescence signal amplification via the trifunctional probe. This probe uniquely combines naphthylamine&#8208;mediated radical targeting, clickable fluorescence imaging, and biotinylation&#8208;facilitated proteome capture, enabling all three within a single tissue section. Strategic PEGylation and multivalent fluorescent conjugation of these probes improves labeling and visualization efficiency and specificity. SVPro allows cell&#8208;type proteomic profiling of neuronal subpopulations in distinct mouse brain regions and amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques in mouse brain of Alzheimer's disease model. Notably, we identified and validated distinct marker proteins associated with amyloid&#8209;&#946; plaques deposited in different brain regions. SVPro therefore emerges as a robust and high&#8208;resolution spatial proteomics approach for simultaneously visualizing the spatial architecture and proteome landscapes of intact tissue microenvironment.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling of Ethers to Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed double C&#9472;O bond activation has been achieved. Diverse ethers were successfully transformed into 1,2&#8208;diarylethanes and linear alkyl arenes. This protocol is extended toward synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Experimental mechanistic investigation and DFT calculations revealed the involvement of radical intermediacy.








Abstract
Alkanes have extensive applications in diverse fields and their natural abundance is dwindling. Ethers are prevalently present in biomolecules and synthetic compounds; however, despite recent progress in their transformations they are considered as unreactive functionalities, and widely used as solvents in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Hence, catalytic synthesis of alkanes from bio&#8208;ample ethers is highly desirable. A simple cobalt&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8211;O bond activation of ethers is attained now; diverse symmetrical and unsymmetrical arylmethyl ethers (ArCH2OCH2Ar&#8242;) are selectively transformed to 1,2&#8208;diaryl alkanes. This protocol is extended toward unsymmetrical arylmethyl alkyl ethers which furnished linear alkyl arenes. Synthesis of biologically active compounds is also achieved utilizing this catalytic method. Consumption of ethers in catalytic deoxygenative coupling to alkanes follows first&#8208;order kinetics. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reactions proceed through molecular intermediates and involve arylmethyl and alkyl radicals. DFT analysis reveals that the in situ generated radical either abstracts a proton from silane, resulting in C&#8211;H bond formation or attacks the aryl silyl ether, leading to C&#8211;C coupling. The reaction mechanism involves intermediates with different spin multiplicities and spin crossover through minimum energy crossing points (MECPs).

         <title>From Methane to Nanodiamond Precursors in Water: Superacid&#8208;like Condensation Pathways Under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under extreme pressure and temperature, superionic water acts as a strong superacid, catalyzing methane polycondensation through pentacoordinated carbonium ions (CH5+). This discovery reveals the non&#8208;classical carbocation chemistry underlying the early stages of diamond formation in water under extreme conditions.








Abstract
The chemical behavior of water and hydrocarbons under extreme pressures and temperatures lies at the heart of processes shaping planetary interiors, influences the deep carbon cycle, and underpins innovative high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure material synthesis. Recent experiments have shown that simple hydrocarbons immersed in water under extreme conditions transform into heavier hydrocarbons and nanodiamonds. However, the chemistry of water in these regimes, and its role in driving hydrocarbon condensation, remain poorly understood. Here, using atomistic simulations techniques, we show that water under extreme conditions acts like a strong superacid, protonating hydrocarbons and forming transient pentacoordinated carbocations such as CH5+. These fleeting species can either transfer the proton to neighboring water species, or release molecular hydrogen to generate highly reactive carbocations that drive hydrocarbon chain growth. These mechanisms parallel the superacid catalyzed hydrocarbon condensation at ambient conditions that was discovered in the work of George Olah, who demonstrated that methane polycondensation proceeds via transient pentacoordinated ions in superacids. Our work shows that the same non&#8208;classical carbocation chemistry emerges in water under extreme conditions, leading to nanodiamond precursors. These findings reveal the existence of superacid&#8208;like hydrocarbon condensation in water, and provide a unifying reaction network that explains chemical transformations in environments such as planetary&#160;interiors.

         <title>Covalent Activation of the C&#8208;type Lectin DC&#8208;SIGN</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the first covalent activators of a C&#8208;type lectin. Using orthogonal functional assays, NMR, MS/MS, and computational modeling, we delineate mechanisms from a functional electrophile&#8208;first screen on dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing non&#8208;integrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) that yields two modes: N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)&#8208;ester 11 modifies K379 to induce carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) oligomerization via a secondary site, and squarate 33 modifies K373 in the carbohydrate site to strengthen glycan binding. 








Abstract
Dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing non&#8208;integrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) is a C&#8208;type lectin receptor expressed on antigen&#8208;presenting cells, crucial for pathogen recognition and immune modulation. The shallow and polar carbohydrate binding site of DC&#8208;SIGN presents challenges for ligand design. Here, we explored covalent modification targeting specific lysine residues as a novel strategy to modulate DC&#8208;SIGN function. Screening a lysine&#8208;targeted electrophilic fragment library using orthogonal functional assays identified two potent activators. Structural analyses via NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and computational modeling confirmed structural perturbations of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and revealed distinct mechanisms of activation. While both activators significantly enhanced DC&#8208;SIGN's affinity for monosaccharide ligands, one compound induced oligomerization via covalent coupling and non&#8208;covalent secondary site interactions, whereas the other selectively modified lysine K373 directly within the primary carbohydrate binding site. These findings demonstrate the potential of lysine&#8208;targeted covalent compounds as a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating DC&#8208;SIGN function and potentially C&#8208;type lectins in general.

         <title>Solvation Entropy as a Lever for Steering the Macroscopic Properties of a Functional Supramolecular Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transition between the two fully&#8208;characterized states of a supramolecular helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer (represented as blue and light pink stacks) can be predictably varied over 85&#160;K by changing the nature and amount of cosolvent; entropy of solvation (schematized as solvents of different sizes) is the main lever to tune the macroscopic properties of the resulting polymers. 








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;solute interactions are utterly important in supramolecular polymers (SPs), yet the high responsivity of SPs to solvent polarity makes it challenging to play on other solvation effects to tune their macroscopic properties in a rational manner. Herein, we report the characterization at various scales of the assembly properties of a C2&#8208;symmetric benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide monomer with two (1S)&#8208;methylheptyl moieties and one diphenylphosphino group as lateral chains. Our investigation reveals a highly cooperative structural transition between two SP states, which can exquisitely be tuned by solvents of similar polarities, leading to variation of the transition temperature (T*) over a range of 85&#160;K. The structural transition was detected in 4 pure solvents and 13 toluene/cosolvent mixtures; a fair relationship is determined between T* and the solvent molar volume. The transition is only weakly favored by enthalpy (by ca. 2&#160;kJ.mol&#8722;1 at 286&#160;K). However, minimization of the entropic cost leads to a notable increase in the T*. This allows a fine tuning of the thermothickening and catalytic properties of the resulting SPs auguring that solvation, and notably solvation entropy, may constitute an important lever for steering SPs structure and properties.

         <title>Terpenoid Synthesis via Convergent Radical Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent radical annulation strategy for the synthesis of complex terpenoids is disclosed. A 1,3&#8208;diradical synthon enabled rapid C&#8208;ring annulations through sequential radical couplings to synthesize serratene and cyclodammarane scaffolds from sclareolide. These concise routes feature unique hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;initiated (HAT) radical cascades including a 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cycloisomerization and a radical/polar crossover (RPC) bicyclization.








Abstract
The development of a convergent radical annulation strategy for the synthesis of complex terpenoids from sclareolide is disclosed. This approach employs a 1,3&#8208;diradical synthon to enable rapid C&#8208;ring annulation through inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical couplings, exemplified in the concise syntheses of serratene and cyclodammarane scaffolds from a common intermediate. Key features include a rapid alternating polarity (rAP) Kolbe electrolysis for onoceradiene assembly, a Co&#8208;electrocatalytic metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cycloisomerization&#9472;the first of its kind&#9472;to form the serratene core, and a tandem Fe&#8208;mediated reductive olefin coupling/enolate alkylation cascade&#9472;also unprecedented&#9472;to forge the [4.3.1] propellane motif of cyclodammaranes with complete diastereocontrol over three contiguous quaternary centers. These routes, completed in 5&#8211;9 steps, maximize skeletal bond&#8208;forming efficiency, feature unique radical cascades, and highlight the advantages of radical&#8208;based disconnections in terpenoid synthesis.

         <title>Perfectly Linear &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene with Near&#8208;Ideal Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust bis&#8208;borane initiator, 1,5&#8208;(bis&#8208;borinane)pentane (1,5&#8208;BBP), for the controlled synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxy polymethylene (PM) via C1 polymerization. Through optimized monomer purification and carefully tailored polymerization conditions, we obtained perfectly linear PM chains&#8212;completely free of side&#8208;branching, precisely controlled molar masses, narrow polydispersity indices, and crystallinity approaching the theoretical maximum.








Abstract
A novel 1,5&#8208;(bis&#8208;borinane)pentane (1,5&#8208;BBP) has been developed for polyhomologation (C1 polymerization), enabling the synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxy polymethylene (PM) with controlled molar masses and narrow polydispersity at elevated temperatures. The structural integrity and complete difunctionality of the PM were confirmed by 1H NMR, 11B NMR, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF MS), and SEC analyses. Achieving perfectly linear polyethylene (PE), an analog to PM, without branching remains a longstanding synthetic challenge, as even trace defects disrupt lamellar packing and reduce crystallinity. We address this limitation through the introduction of a monomer purification strategy for dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide in C1 polymerization that, for the first time, reduces residual branching to&#160;&lt;0.04%, as confirmed by quantitative 13C NMR. The resulting nascent PM exhibits exceptional properties, including enthalpies of fusion up to 290 J&#183;g&#8722;1, melting temperatures of 138 &#176;C&#8211;143.15 &#176;C, and crystallinity values of 93.8%&#8211;99.1% (DSC) and 92.0%&#8211;95.9% (WAXS). Solid&#8208;state 2D 1H&#8208;13C cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinningwide&#8208;line separation (CP&#8211;MAS WISE) NMR spectra further confirm predominantly crystalline domains with minimal amorphous content. This study demonstrates that precise control over initiator design, monomer purity, and reaction conditions enables &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;terminated PM with crystallinity approaching the theoretical limits.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Organocatalyst Combinations as Powerful Multicatalytic Systems for Aerobic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicatalytic strategy based on the simple combination of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and organocatalysts is able to mediate challenging aerobic oxidation reactions. The use of earth&#8208;abundant MOFs and commercially available (hydro)quinone co&#8208;catalysts greatly simplify the generation of powerful multicatalytic systems, opening the door for the exploration of new reactivity.








Abstract
Aerobic oxidation using molecular oxygen as terminal oxidant represents a sustainable route to access valuable organic compounds. However, achieving high selectivity in such transformations remains challenging. Here, an easily tunable biomimetic multicatalytic system combining robust Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and simple, commercially available, (hydro)quinone&#8208;type molecules as co&#8208;catalysts, which mimics the cooperative action of enzyme/coenzyme pairs in a confined environment is reported. A Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808/1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene semiheterogeneous system enables the aerobic oxidation of anilines to azoxybenzenes, products that are typically elusive under aerobic conditions, with excellent yields and selectivity. Electron transfer triggers the formation of active oxidation sites in the MOF/(hydro)quinone interface, able to generate reactive oxygen species from O2 under mild conditions without the need for light or other external stimuli. The generality of this novel multicatalytic approach is demonstrated by expanding it to different reactions and catalytic systems. In particular, the aerobic oxidation of thiols to disulfides is achieved by changing the organic co&#8208;catalyst, whereas benzylamines are aerobically oxidized to their corresponding coupled products by employing a Ti&#8208;based MOF (Ti&#8208;MIL&#8208;125) together with another co&#8208;catalyst. Overall, this work highlights the untapped potential of MOF/organocatalyst combinations to drive challenging reactions under environmentally benign conditions.

Thermally activatable SpyCatcher/SpyTag system enables rapid physiological gelation with robust mechanical properties and high cytocompatibility, advancing injectable biomaterials for cell encapsulation and tissue engineering.








Abstract
Injectable and in situ&#8208;forming hydrogels are attractive for tissue engineering and drug delivery, yet challenges remain in balancing gelation speed, mechanical strength, and cytocompatibility. Here, we report a thermally activatable SpyCatcher/SpyTag (TASpy) system that undergoes rapid chemical crosslinking at physiological temperature. Inspired by the CnaB2 domain, thermally activatable SpyCatcher (TASpyC) fuses SpyCatcher with a non&#8208;reactive SpyTag mutant, creating a single polypeptide that remains folded and minimally reactive at lower temperatures yet partially unfolds at 37&#160;&#176;C to expose a covalent binding site. This design enables controlled isopeptide&#8208;bond formation, facilitating the formation of robust injectable protein hydrogels. We demonstrate improved mechanical properties, enhanced cell encapsulation, and accelerated gelation upon heating&#8212;supporting high cell viability and in vivo retention. Notably, subcutaneous injections of TASpy&#8208;based precursors solidify within minutes, degrade over five weeks, and exhibit excellent biocompatibility, underscoring the potential of TASpy hydrogels for advanced biomedical applications.

         <title>Building Ligand&#8208;Responsive Artificial Signaling Pathways Through Programmable Trans&#8208;Acting RNA Circuits in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a versatile strategy to engineer ligand&#8208;responsive artificial signaling pathways through programmable RNA circuits in mammalian cells. With this design, cells can be endowed with new capabilities to sense and deal with the variations of endogenous metabolites and proteins through controllable cellular responses in a cell state/type&#8208;specific manner, which may be applicable for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.








Abstract
Synthetic RNA circuits provide powerful tools to reprogram genetic networks for customized cellular functions. However, the construction of ligand&#8208;induced complex synthetic signaling pathways in mammalian cells remains challenging due to the lack of modular and scalable RNA&#8208;based components. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to engineer ligand&#8208;responsive artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) using programmable RNA circuits. By designing aptamer&#8208;embedded circular RNAs as trans&#8208;acting triggers coupled with controllable CRISPR functions as outputs, we demonstrate that various small molecules and proteins can be sensed and transduced into manipulation of originally unrelated endogenous genes through amplifiable, logical and multiplexed RNA circuits. Integration of this RNA system into the cellular genetic network endows cells with state/type&#8208;specific phenotype responses regulated by endogenous metabolites and proteins. This study establishes a universal RNA platform for engineering ASPs induced by ligands in mammalian cells, with broad potential of cellular signaling and response engineering for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Long Single&#8208;Stranded DNA with Site&#8208;Specific Modifications to Enable Single&#8208;Base&#8208;Resolution Epigenetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust one&#8208;pot synthesis of long single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with precise site&#8208;specific modifications. When applied to 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) patterns and CRISPR/HDR, this method enables single&#8208;base resolution epigenetic manipulation and uncovers synergistic density effects in methylation maintenance. 








Abstract
We report a method for synthesizing site&#8208;specifically modified long single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high purity and fidelity. With the successful synthesis of long ssDNA carrying different 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) patterns, single&#8208;base&#8208;resolution analysis of 5mC epigenetic dynamics at specific genomic loci were enabled in mammalian cells. The results revealed that the density of 5mC sites synergistically correlated with their maintenance. This study opens new avenues for precise epigenetic manipulation and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Solution ALD of (CH3NH3)(PbI3) Perovskite Thin Films Yields Functional Quality and Stability Superior to Classical Processing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically controlled deposition of the prototypical hybrid halide perovskite methylammonium triiodoplumbate(II), MAPI, is demonstrated in layer by layer fashion from the solution phase. Theoretical modeling confirms the accretion mechanism. Extensive materials and functional characterization highlight how chemical control of nucleation and growth delivers solids of high purity and of functional quality better than classical engineering approaches do in which precipitation is driven by solvent evaporation. 








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level control of solution&#8208;processed hybrid halide perovskites is achieved experimentally by solution atomic layer deposition (sALD). This method transfers the surface chemical principles of gas&#8208;phase ALD (gALD) to precursors dissolved in the liquid phase. Circumventing limitations associated with precursor volatility, sALD broadens the portfolio of reaction chemistries usable and material classes accessible. We establish its applicability to depositing ultrathin films of ionic semiconductors by developing an sALD procedure for the most prominent halide perovskite, methylammonium triiodoplumbate (CH3NH3PbI3, &#8216;MAPI&#8216;). The process saturates upon precursor dosage variation to self&#8208;limiting growth typical for ALD, as analyzed by ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ techniques. sALD&#8208;deposited MAPI is highly pure, stoichiometric, and polycrystalline. When MAPI films are prepared in congruent pairs by sALD and by a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;coating method, sALD&#8208;grown films clearly outperform their spin&#8208;coated counterparts in terms of charge carrier lifetimes and stability. They exhibit high carrier mobility and yield functional light absorbing layers in solar cells.

         <title>Photoswitchable Peptides as Molecular Tools to Encode Structural Order and Disorder in Intracellular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photoswitchable peptide conjugate which exhibits isomerism&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly: the planar trans&#8208;isomer assembles into well&#8208;ordered nanofibers while the non&#8208;planar cis&#8208;isomer yields disordered aggregates. Our study offers a direct visualization on the effects of structure formation inside living cells.








Abstract
Understanding how self&#8208;assembled structure formation affects cells remains a central challenge in supramolecular chemistry. However, chemical tools that allow access to both ordered and disordered intracellular assemblies from a single molecular scaffold are rare due to design complexity. Here, we present a photoswitchable isotripeptide incorporating an arylazopyrazole (AAP) unit, which undergoes intracellular cleavage to yield a self&#8208;assembling monomer. Upon photoisomerization, the planar trans&#8208;isomer forms &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich nanofibers with strong aromatic interactions, while the non&#8208;planar cis&#8208;isomer assembles into disordered, random&#8208;coil aggregates lacking aromatic contribution. The structural dynamics of the assemblies are demonstrated by repeated photoswitching between the two states in buffered conditions. Notably, A549 cancer cell viability correlates with the isomer&#8208;dependent assembly behavior and critical aggregation concentrations (CACs): the trans&#8208;isomer, with higher aggregation propensity, exhibits greater cytotoxicity. This photoswitchable peptide system thus provides a powerful platform with fast, reversible and robust switching kinetics, long isomer half&#8208;lives, and high photostability to probe the intracellular consequences of supramolecular order and disorder using a single molecular scaffold.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2] Annulations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl &#947;&#8208;Benzyl Allenoates via a Transannular Cyclization Approach</title>

An enantioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#945;&#8208;allyl &#947;&#8208;benzyl allenoates, catalyzed by chiral spiro phosphines via an intramolecular and transannular cyclization relay, has been developed. This strategy enables the efficient synthesis of a variety of chiral bicyclo[3.2.0]heptenes bearing three contiguous stereocenters, delivering good yields and excellent stereoselectivities.








Abstract
Fused cyclobutane frameworks are valuable scaffolds in natural products and pharmaceuticals, yet catalytic asymmetric methods for their construction remain rare due to ring strain and stereocontrol challenges. Here, we report a spiro phosphine&#8208;catalyzed, stereoconvergent, and enantioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of racemic &#945;&#8208;allyl &#947;&#8208;benzyl allenoates via transannular cyclization, efficiently delivering bicyclo[3.2.0]heptenes in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Experimental studies and DFT calculations indicate a stepwise mechanism involving seven&#8208;membered zwitterion formation, dynamic kinetic resolution through reversible nucleophilic addition, and a rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining deprotonation via intramolecular hydrogen transfer. This protocol offers a concise and general approach to enantioenriched fused cyclobutanes, expanding synthetic options for drug discovery.

         <title>Enhanced&#8208;Type Quantitative Luminescence Recognition for Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A millimeter&#8208;sized luminescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) single crystal is developed as a robust, reusable sensor for per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Unlike conventional sensing conducted by MOF powders, the single crystal enables easy usage, improved stability, and enhanced luminescence response, facilitating practical PFAS detection via well&#8208;defined host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Rapid and quantitative detection of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remains a critical challenge in environmental monitoring due to their low light absorption capacities. Luminescent sensing based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables analyte&#8208;specific optical responses through well&#8208;defined host&#8211;guest interactions, though conventional MOF powders as sensing materials face limitations in practical deployment for their stabilities and recyclable capacities. Herein, we report a millimeter&#8208;sized luminescent MOF single crystal that functions as a reusable sensor for PFAS, exhibiting an enhanced&#8208;type luminescence response upon analyte binding. In contrast to MOF powders, which often suffer from suspension instability and material loss during recycling, the single&#8208;crystal format offers robust structural integrity, direct handling, and facile recovery. The sensor exhibits exponential luminescence responses toward five commonly encountered PFAS and retains its sensing performance for 10 cycles. This work presents a durable and scalable luminescent platform for PFAS detection and underscores the role of dimensional control in advancing MOF&#8208;based sensing technologies.

         <title>Synthesis of Chlorine&#8208;Terminated MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction with TiCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium tetrachloride is demonstrated as a new gas&#8208;phase etchant to fabricate several different chlorine&#8208;terminated&#160;MXenes from their parent MAX phases in a completely dry process. The MXene structures are analyzed, and the experimental results are corroborated by computational analysis. Ti3C2Cl2 MXene is then delaminated using Li intercalant in organic solvents and subjected to further characterization. 








Abstract
Despite rapid research progress in the field of MXenes over the past decade, this new family of nanomaterials still faces challenges in terms of scalable manufacturing and control over surface chemistry, which determines many of their physicochemical properties. This work demonstrates titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a new type of gas&#8208;phase etchant for the dry selective extraction of the A&#8208;element (Al) from MAX phases, providing MXenes with uniform chlorine surface terminations. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive washing, which is required in the cases of wet&#8208;chemical and molten salt etching. Computational data suggest that TiCl4 reacts with the MAX phases directly to extract AlCl3 rather than forming any intermediate phases. One of the resulting MXenes, Ti3C2Cl2, was then delaminated into few&#8208;layer flakes by intercalating lithium ions from an organic solvent. Some of the hydrophobic delaminated flakes were discovered to roll into a tubular shape, forming 1&#8208;dimensional nanoscrolls. Our dry etching process provides opportunities for the scalable synthesis of halogen&#8208;terminated Ti&#8208; and Nb&#8208;based MXenes with two to four M&#8208;element layers and controlled surface chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials with a molecularly controlled, dense presentation of carbohydrates on their surfaces, serving as biological cues.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of molecular building blocks into ordered supramolecular structures enables the creation of nanomaterials that can display ligands on their surfaces with molecular precision. However, many of these supramolecular scaffolds face challenges in incorporating bulky or hydrophilic ligands, such as carbohydrates. This issue often requires the co&#8208;assembly of ligand&#8208;containing blocks with non&#8208;functionalized ones, diluting ligand presentation and compromising their precise spatial arrangement. Herein, we present carbohydrate oligomers that assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials featuring a molecularly controlled, dense presentation of carbohydrate ligands on their surfaces. This modular system accommodates a variety of carbohydrate ligands while maintaining consistent bulk material properties. Using this approach, we have engineered a series of supramolecular hydrogels, whose nanostructure displays specific carbohydrate residues with high density that act as biological cues to influence the morphology of Candida albicans.

         <title>Unlocking Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Beyond via External Heavy&#8208;Atom Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncovalent strategy to activate and enhance room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free chromophores through external heavy&#8208;atom engineering (HAE) is reported. Incorporating these chromophores into halogen&#8208;rich polymer matrices brings them into close spatial proximity with heavy atoms, thereby facilitating the intersystem crossing process via external HAE and thus unlocking RTP.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from purely organic materials holds great potential for optoelectronic and bioimaging applications; however, its realization remains challenging due to inefficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and rapid nonradiative decay. Herein, we present an effective strategy to activate and enhance RTP in heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free chromophores through external heavy&#8208;atom engineering (HAE). By dispersing these chromophores within hydrophobic halogen&#8208;rich polymer matrices, external HAE is employed to enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling and promote efficient ISC. The generality of this strategy is demonstrated across a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and further extended to other heterocyclic chromophores, affording bright (phosphorescence quantum yields up to 61.6%) and long&#8208;lived (phosphorescence lifetimes up to 273&#160;ms) RTP materials under ambient conditions, with emission wavelengths spanning from 500 to 700&#160;nm. This supramolecular approach circumvents the need for covalent introduction of heavy atoms to the luminophores, thereby preserving their intrinsic photophysical properties while unlocking desirable triplet&#8208;state emissions. Overall, the current external HAE strategy provides a versatile platform for the construction of high&#8208;performance organic RTP materials, offering new insights into the design principles of organic RTP systems and broadening the material landscape for optoelectronic and bioimaging applications.

The generality of this strategy is demonstrated across a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and further extended to other heterocyclic chromophores, affording bright (phosphorescence quantum yields up to 61.6%) and long-lived (phosphorescence lifetimes up to 273&#160;ms) RTP materials under ambient conditions, with emission wavelengths spanning from 500 to 700&#160;nm. This supramolecular approach circumvents the need for covalent introduction of heavy atoms to the luminophores, thereby preserving their intrinsic photophysical properties while unlocking desirable triplet-state emissions. Overall, the current external HAE strategy provides a versatile platform for the construction of high-performance organic RTP materials, offering new insights into the design principles of organic RTP systems and broadening the material landscape for optoelectronic and bioimaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Shortcut Denitrification Coupled with Chemical Diazotization for Low&#8208;Carbon Nitrate Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a low&#8208;carbon and high&#8208;energy&#8208;efficiency denitrification strategy by coupling electrochemical shortcut denitrification (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion) with chemical diazotization (ESD&#8208;CD), where NO3&#8722; is first electrochemically reduced to NO2&#8722; by an oxide&#8208;derived Cu foam electrode, which then reacts with sulfamate (NH2SO3&#8722;) via chemical diazotization to rapidly generate N2. This effective coupling of two processes can ensure nearly 100% N2 selectivity and also shorten the electrolysis process, significantly boosting the denitrification rate and reducing the energy consumption. This study offers a novel strategy for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;carbon wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Efficient treatment of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) wastewater with low carbon emission is a tough challenge because traditional multiple&#8208;effect evaporation and biological denitrification are carbon&#8208;intensive, especially in the case of NO3&#8722; concentration higher than 1000&#160;mg&#8208;N L&#8722;1. In this study, we demonstrate a low&#8208;carbon and high&#8208;energy&#8208;efficiency denitrification strategy by coupling electrochemical shortcut denitrification (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion) with chemical diazotization (ESD&#8208;CD), where NO3&#8722; is first electrochemically reduced to NO2&#8722; by an oxide&#8208;derived Cu foam electrode, which then reacts with sulfamate (NH2SO3&#8722;) via chemical diazotization to rapidly generate N2. For 5000&#160;mg&#8208;N L&#8722;1 simulated NO3&#8722; wastewater, the ESD&#8208;CD achieved 98.8% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency, 99.9% N2 selectivity, and 95.3% Faradaic efficiency. Impressively, its energy consumption was as low as 9.97&#160;kWh kg&#8208;N&#8722;1, and its denitrification rate reached an unprecedented record of 24.87&#160;g&#8208;N m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Driven by photovoltaic cells, the ESD&#8208;CD process maintained stable performance in treating industrial NO3&#8722; wastewater (3085.2&#160;mg&#8208;N L&#8722;1) with over 96.6% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency and 99.2% N2 selectivity, and also reduced operational costs by 64.4% and 74.9%, and CO2 emissions by 79.5% and 93.3% in comparison with biological denitrification and multiple&#8208;effect evaporation, underscoring the promising potential of coupling selective electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction with chemical diazotization for sustainable treatment of high&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; wastewater.

         <title>The Histidine Kinase VraS Interacts with Vancomycin and Penicillins Through its Membrane&#8208;Anchored N&#8208;terminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The signals triggering activation of VraTSR, a key regulator of the cell wall stress response in Staphylococcus aureus, remain unknown. Combining crosslinking assays with vancomycin&#8208; and ampicillin&#8208;derived photoprobes or VraS&#8208;pAzF variants and Saturation Transfer Difference NMR experiments, we demonstrate that these two structurally distinct antibiotics bind to the N&#8208;terminal membrane&#8208;anchored region of the histidine kinase VraS, establishing VraS as a pivotal component in antibiotic detection.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major global health threat, with the VraTSR three&#8208;component system playing a key role in conferring resistance to cell&#8208;wall active antibiotics, through regulation of the cell wall stress stimulon. The molecular signals sensed by VraTSR remain unknown. We investigated interactions of the membrane histidine kinase VraS with &#946;&#8208;lactams and glycopeptides. Photo&#8208;crosslinking assays with a vancomycin&#8208;derived and an ampicillin&#8208;derived photoprobe revealed direct interaction of these two classes of antibiotics with full&#8208;length VraS. Saturation transfer difference (STD) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments confirmed vancomycin, ampicillin and penicillin G binding to VraS, with the involvement of aryl protons from the antibiotics. STD NMR assays with truncated versions of VraS demonstrated that ampicillin and vancomycin bind to the membrane&#8208;anchored N&#8208;terminal region of VraS. In contrast, assays with membrane vesicles expressing only VraT or co&#8208;expressing VraS/VraT did not show covalent adduct formation between VraT and the vancomycin&#8208;derived photoprobe. VraS p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine mutants demonstrated participation of the extracellular loop of VraS in &#946;&#8208;lactam binding. These results demonstrate that vancomycin and penicillins directly interact with VraS, an interaction that could be involved in activation of the cell wall stress stimulon and the mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance.

The kinetics of mechanochemical reactions can be markedly altered through the selective pre&#8208;activation of starting reagents, as revealed through reaction monitoring using time&#8208;resolved in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and ab initio density functional theory simulation.








Abstract
Learning to control reaction kinetics is essential for translating any chemical technology into real&#8208;world application. Based on time&#8208;resolved in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we demonstrate the opportunity to tune mechanochemical reaction rates through the pre&#8208;activation of the starting reagents. For three model co&#8208;crystal systems, the pre&#8208;activation of the most stable reagent yields up to a ca 10&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate, whilst negligible kinetic enhancement is seen when the less stable reagent is pre&#8208;activated. Moreover, we demonstrate how the polymorphic outcome of mechano&#8208;co&#8208;crystallization is also sensitive to pre&#8208;activation of the starting material. Our results suggest that reproducibility of mechanochemical processes requires detailed understanding over the origin and history of reagent powders, whilst providing a new conceptual framework to design and control mechanochemical reactions.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrosynthesis of Glycine from Glyoxylic Acid and Nitrate via Stabilizing the NH2OH Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

Highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH2OH and promoting the key C&#8211;N coupling process from *NH2OH and GOA yet suppressing the generation of the by&#8208;products on CuSn alloys catalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling reactions have emerged as an important strategy for synthesizing value&#8208;added organic compounds under ambient environment, among which glycine is of practical importance for various biological activities and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, such synthesis suffers from limited selectivity due to the complex reaction pathways. In this study, we report the highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH2OH and optimizing the absorption of glyoxylic acid on copper&#8208;based model catalysts. Theoretical calculations and operando measurements indicate that CuSn alloys promote the generation of NH2OH and optimize the absorption of glyoxylic acid, thereby facilitating the precise coupling of C&#8211;N groups to synthesize glycine. Consequently, the CuSn electrocatalyst delivers an excellent performance for the co&#8208;reduction to generate glycine with a maximum Faradaic efficiency and selectivity of 78.69% and 99.32%, respectively. Moreover, the CuSn catalyst enables the production of 0.73&#160;g of glycine with a conversion rate of 100%, respectively, in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that the total cost for the proposed method is 1158.88 $ ton&#8722;1, 1.78&#8208;fold lower than the commercial price (2060.44 $ ton&#8722;1), suggesting that the electrosynthesis of glycine in our system is a feasible and profitable route.

&lt;p&gt;Highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co-reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and promoting the key C&#8211;N coupling process from *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and GOA yet suppressing the generation of the by-products on CuSn alloys catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling reactions have emerged as an important strategy for synthesizing value-added organic compounds under ambient environment, among which glycine is of practical importance for various biological activities and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, such synthesis suffers from limited selectivity due to the complex reaction pathways. In this study, we report the highly selective synthesis of glycine from the electrocatalytic co-reduction of nitrate and glyoxylic acid via stabilizing the intermediates of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and optimizing the absorption of glyoxylic acid on copper-based model catalysts. Theoretical calculations and operando measurements indicate that CuSn alloys promote the generation of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and optimize the absorption of glyoxylic acid, thereby facilitating the precise coupling of C&#8211;N groups to synthesize glycine. Consequently, the CuSn electrocatalyst delivers an excellent performance for the co-reduction to generate glycine with a maximum Faradaic efficiency and selectivity of 78.69% and 99.32%, respectively. Moreover, the CuSn catalyst enables the production of 0.73&#160;g of glycine with a conversion rate of 100%, respectively, in large-scale synthesis. Techno-economic analysis reveals that the total cost for the proposed method is 1158.88 $ ton&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.78-fold lower than the commercial price (2060.44 $ ton&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), suggesting that the electrosynthesis of glycine in our system is a feasible and profitable route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Human Proteoglycan Linkage Region Glycosyltransferases are Dimeric and Show Unexpected Specificities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

Non&#8208;canonical glycopeptides of the proteoglycan linkage region are accessible by the enzymes B3GalT6 and GlcAT&#8208;1 confirming a recently discovered rescue mode in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis. The crystal structure of B3GalT6 revealed a covalent dimer linked by a disulfide.








Abstract
We selected the N,O&#8208;glycosylated proteoglycan bikunin as a model to establish a chemoenzymatic approach to defined proteoglycans using native chemical ligation. Overexpression of the human linkage region glycosyltransferases B4GalT7, B3GalT6 and B3GlcAT&#8208;1 as N&#8208;terminal SUMO&#8208;fusions gave high yields of soluble and active enzymes in E. coli. When starting with xylosylated bikunin peptides the transferases performed well in enzymatic cascade reactions and provided the desired linkage region tetrasaccharide glycopeptides. B3GalT6 and B3GlcAT&#8208;1 led to side products with N,O&#8208;glycosylated bikunin peptides revealing unexpected promiscuity of both enzymes towards complex type N&#8208;glycans. Additionally, B3GalT6 was found to synthesize short poly&#8208;&#946;3&#160;Gal structures. B3GlcAT&#8208;1 can slowly convert the biosynthetic intermediate Gal&#8208;Xyl to the non&#8208;canonical trisaccharide GlcA&#8208;Gal&#8208;Xyl. This reaction independently confirmed the recently detected biosynthetic bypass to GAGs in the case of dysfunctional B3GalT6 (spondylodysplastic Ehlers&#8208;Danlos&#8208;syndrome). The three linkage region glycosyltransferases B4GalT7, B3GalT6 and B3GlcAT&#8208;1 were dimeric in solution and the crystal structure of B3GalT6 was solved showing a covalent dimer linked by a disulfide in the center of the large dimerization domain. This motif appears to be conserved in higher organisms and reinforces the concept of dimeric glycosyltransferases lining the Golgi.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Near&#8208;Infrared Chiral TeSe Nanodrug Against Orthotopic Drug&#8208;Resistant Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This first brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chiral TeSe nanodrug was fabricated via self&#8208;assembly and apolipoprotein E&#8208;modification. D&#8208;TeSe showed enhanced cellular uptake, blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and tumor specificity compared to L&#8208;TeSe, benefiting from chirality recognition. 808&#160;nm irradiation elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of D&#8208;TeSe, selectively inducing apoptosis and oxidative death in orthotopic drug&#8208;resistant glioma, significantly improving survival. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a formidable therapeutic challenge due to its high invasiveness, the highly restrictive blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), and frequent drug resistance, necessitating new therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed tellurium&#8208;selenium nanoparticles (TeSe NPs) with exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chiroptical properties and potent antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant glioma for the first time. Notably, the right&#8208;handed nanoparticles (D&#8208;TeSe NPs) exhibited higher cellular uptake than left&#8208;handed L&#8208;TeSe NPs through chirality&#8208;selective recognition by drug&#8208;resistant glioma cells. The Te and Se active centers in D&#8208;TeSe NPs selectively triggered severe oxidative stress in glioma cells, leading to redox imbalance, reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately causing 44.2% glioma cell death (versus 37.1% for L&#8208;TeSe NPs). When combined with 808&#160;nm right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, D&#8208;TeSe NPs showed enhanced ROS generation, elevating therapeutic efficacy to 62.5% while maintaining negligible toxicity to normal cells. Furthermore, apolipoprotein E&#8208;functionalized D&#8208;TeSe NPs demonstrated improved BBB penetration and tumor&#8208;targeting capability, significantly extending the survival of mice with orthotopic drug&#8208;resistant glioma to 52 days (versus 21 days for PBS control). This study pioneers a NIR and brain&#8208;targeted chiral nanoplatform for precision therapy of orthotopic glioma, offering a chirality&#8208;driven paradigm against drug&#8208;resistant malignancies and other brain diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Zinc Modulation Stabilizes Ru Clusters on Spinel Oxide for Efficient and Durable Acid Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing low&#8208;Ru anodes with high activity and durability is challenging for PEMWE. We synthesized Ruclusters/ZnCo2O4 via an inert Zn stabilizing strategy. Zn stabilizes the structure and optimizes Ru&#8217;s electronic environment through electron buffering. This dual regulation achieves 200&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &gt;725 h stability. In PEMWE, it operates &gt;275 h at 200&#160;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating a new paradigm of using inert metals to regulate supports for dual activity&#8208;stability breakthroughs.








Abstract
The development of low ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based anodes with high activity and durability is crucial and still a challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) systems at a low cost. Here, we synthesized a Ru cluster catalyst (Ruclusters/ZnCo2O4) loaded on zinc (Zn)&#8208;doped cobalt oxide spinel, where the presence of Zn atoms transforms the support (ZnCo2O4) from a &#8220;fragile structure&#8221; to a &#8220;stable substrate&#8221; and indirectly stabilizes the Ru active center by optimizing the electronic environment of the Ru sites through electron transfer meanwhile, thereby achieving a balance between high activity and stability in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The prepared catalysts with a low overpotential (200&#160;mV) and can operate stably for over 725 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (with a decay rate of only 0.143&#160;mV h&#8722;1). A PEMWE device uses Ruclusters/ZnCo2O4 as the anodes operate stably for over 275 h at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating promising application potential. Theoretical calculations and experiments reveal Zn atoms can regulate the support electronic structure concurrently, endowing the catalysts with high activity and long lifetime. This strategy provides a new paradigm for the development of acidic OER catalysts: utilizing inert metals to regulate the supports, achieving dual breakthroughs in activity and stability.

         <title>High&#8208;Concentration Alcohol Generation in Bipolar Membrane CO Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a forward&#8208;biased bipolar membrane (FB&#8208;BPM) CO electrolyzer that reduces liquid product crossover to&#160;&lt;10% (8x lower than conventional designs) while minimizing hydrogen production and in favor of multicarbon liquid species. By engineering catalyst morphology to modulate the binding of *CO, *H, and *OH intermediates, we identified a CuSn catalyst enhancing C2&#8211;C1 coupling pathways for alcohols formation. Integrating the reactor design with catalyst innovation, we achieve&#160;&gt;15 wt% alcohols production directly from the cathodic outlet.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide offers an electricity&#8208;powered route to make multicarbon liquid products. However, in conventional systems employing anion exchange membranes (AEMs), significant liquid product crossover leads to dilute product streams, increasing separation costs; and also produces unwanted anodic oxidation, further decreasing overall efficiency. Here, we report a forward&#8208;biased bipolar membrane (FB&#8208;BPM) system that achieves&#160;&lt;10% liquid product crossover while sustaining a highly alkaline environment near the cathode, suppressing ethylene and hydrogen and favoring liquid products. By tuning catalyst composition to modulate the adsorption of *H and *OH, we steer selectivity toward acetate and alcohols. Using the FB&#8208;BPM system, we achieve&#160;&gt;25 wt% acetate on CuZn and&#160;&gt;15 wt% alcohols on CuSn directly from the cathode outlet stream.

         <title>Binaphthalene&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Scorpionate Zinc Catalysts for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Bio&#8208;Based &#947;&#8208;Ketolactones to High&#8208;Molar&#8208;Mass Degradable Polyesters</title>

We developed binaphthalene&#8208;modified C&#8208;scorpionate zinc catalysts with high activity and stability, enabling efficient, controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;derived &#947;&#8208;ketolactones to produce high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polyesters (Mn&#160;&gt;&#160;800&#160;kDa) with excellent mechanical performance and photodegradability. This system also prevents catalyst aggregation and achieves precise chain&#8208;length control even at low catalyst loadings.








Abstract
The metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic (di)esters is a key strategy for producing sustainable polyesters, yet the development of robust, efficient, and tunable catalysts remains a major challenge. Herein, we reported a series of zinc catalysts supported by poly(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane (C&#8208;scorpionate) ligands for the controlled ROP of 4,4,6,7&#8208;tetramethyloxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (MeOPD), a bio&#8208;derived &#947;&#8208;ketolactone obtained from ketoisophorone. Ligand framework optimization afforded a highly active and stable binaphthalene&#8208;containing zinc complex, enabling the synthesis of degradable polyesters with absolute Mw&#160;&gt;&#160;900&#160;kDa and Mn&#160;&gt;&#160;800&#160;kDa. Mechanistic studies revealed that steric and electronic features of the ligand suppress catalyst aggregation and stabilize the Zn&#9472;OR species. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited remarkable tolerance to excess alcohols, allowing for precise molar mass control even at low catalyst loadings while maintaining polymerization efficiency. Tensile testing confirmed improved mechanical properties of the resulting polyesters with increasing molar mass, while photodegradation studies demonstrated efficient UV&#8208;triggered degradation enabled by backbone ketone functionalities. These findings offer important insights into catalyst design for next&#8208;generation sustainable polymers.

         <title>In Cellulo Peptide Cyclization via Gene&#8208;Encoded Proximity&#8208;Induced Proline&#8208;Isothiocyanate Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cellulo de novo biosynthesis of complex cyclic peptides remains a substantial technical challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that an isothiocyanate (ITC) group encoded via genetic code expansion could selectively and efficiently crosslink to proximal N&#8208;terminal Pro (P&#8208;ITC crosslinking) and affords cyclic peptides without obvious limitations. Via P&#8208;ITC crosslinking, a disulfide&#8208;bridged 13&#8208;mer bicyclic peptide is facilely constructed in E. coli.








Abstract
Cyclic peptides represent a very useful modality in modern drug discovery. However, there remain substantial technical challenges in the de novo biosynthesis of complex cyclic peptides particularly in an intracellular manner. Herein, we demonstrate that an isothiocyanate (ITC) group encoded via genetic code expansion could selectively and efficiently crosslink to proximal N&#8208;terminal Pro (P&#8208;ITC crosslinking) and affords cyclic peptides without obvious limitations related to amino acid composition (including Lys and Cys) or sequence length. Notably via P&#8208;ITC crosslinking, a disulfide&#8208;bridged 13&#8208;mer bicyclic peptide is facilely constructed in E. coli, thus lending us the ability to intracellularly construct and select complex cyclic peptides.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Trap Induced &#8220;Hot&#8221; Microenvironment Boosting Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shallow energy&#8208;level defects in MWO&#8208;S act as electron traps, rapidly capturing, storing, and releasing hot electrons, thereby minimizing their thermalization. It simultaneously generates a highly active &#8220;hot&#8221; microenvironment, which significantly boosts the catalytic conversion of inert nitrogen. These findings inspire the development of catalytic systems engineered for hot&#8208;electron&#8208;active surfaces.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis aims to develop a highly reactive surface enriched with hot carriers to enable challenging chemical processes, including high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier nitrogen reduction reactions. In traditional plasmonic photocatalysis, hot carriers often undergo rapid thermalization, leading to suboptimal catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the role of hot carriers in surface reactions is often complex and frequently overlooked. Here, we designed a photocatalyst through loading Au nanoparticles on Mo&#8208;doped W18O49 nanorods (Au&#8208;MWO&#8208;S) to achieve efficient nitrogen reduction to produce ammonia, with a formation rate reaching 571.0 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (STA) conversion efficiency up to 0.28%. It was revealed through in situ experiments and theoretical simulations that the shallow energy&#8208;level defects in MWO&#8208;S act as electron traps to rapidly capture, store, and release hot electrons, which greatly reduces the thermalization of hot electrons. At the same time, the local electromagnetic field of MWO&#8208;S was enhanced, creating a high&#8208;activity &#8220;hot&#8221; microenvironment on the surface of the photocatalyst. This, in turn, increased the occupancy of electrons in the anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of N2, significantly promoting photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (pNRR). This work unveils the mechanism of hot carrier participation in surface reactions, inspiring the development of catalytic systems with hot&#8208;electron&#8208;active surfaces.

         <title>Construction of Small&#8208;Molecule Deubiquitinase&#8208;Targeting Chimeras to Reactivate and Stabilize Mutant p53 Y220C in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrated that DUBTAC A1 effectively reactivated and deubiquitinated mutant p53 Y220C in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this dual&#8208;action strategy proved superior to PK5196 (p53 Y220C reactivator) in inducing apoptosis in p53 Y220C&#8208;mutant Huh7 cells and achieved a 61.06% reduction in tumor weight in Huh7 xenograft model, marking a significant advance for both p53 Y220C therapy and the broader DUBTAC field.








Abstract
Wild&#8208;type p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is crucial in various pathological processes. The predominant strategy for p53 Y220C mutant involves binding reactivators to mutation&#8208;induced pocket to stabilize the protein thermally and restore wild&#8208;type structure. However, the corrected p53 Y220C remains vulnerable to ubiquitination, reducing protein levels and impairing function. Herein, we report the development of p53 Y220C&#8208;specific deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimeras (DUBTACs)&#8212;bifunctional small molecules concurrently recruiting both p53 Y220C and the deubiquitinase OTUB1. The most potent compound, A1, effectively restored wild&#8208;type conformation and potently removed ubiquitin. Furthermore, A1 demonstrated superior efficacy in inducing apoptosis in p53 Y220C&#8208;mutant Huh7 cells and achieved a 61.06% reduction in tumor weight in Huh7 xenograft model. Our results demonstrated&#160;the viability of the DUBTAC strategy for p53 Y220C, successfully re&#8208;establishing conformation&#160;and promoting&#160;deubiquitination. More importantly, this study provides the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for DUBTAC application&#160;in vivo, establishing targeted deubiquitination as a therapeutic approach.

&lt;p&gt;This research demonstrated that DUBTAC &lt;b&gt;A1&lt;/b&gt; effectively reactivated and deubiquitinated mutant p53 Y220C in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this dual-action strategy proved superior to &lt;b&gt;PK5196&lt;/b&gt; (p53 Y220C reactivator) in inducing apoptosis in p53 Y220C-mutant Huh7 cells and achieved a 61.06% reduction in tumor weight in Huh7 xenograft model, marking a significant advance for both p53 Y220C therapy and the broader DUBTAC field.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild-type p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is crucial in various pathological processes. The predominant strategy for p53 Y220C mutant involves binding reactivators to mutation-induced pocket to stabilize the protein thermally and restore wild-type structure. However, the corrected p53 Y220C remains vulnerable to ubiquitination, reducing protein levels and impairing function. Herein, we report the development of p53 Y220C-specific deubiquitinase-targeting chimeras (DUBTACs)&#8212;bifunctional small molecules concurrently recruiting both p53 Y220C and the deubiquitinase OTUB1. The most potent compound, &lt;b&gt;A1&lt;/b&gt;, effectively restored wild-type conformation and potently removed ubiquitin. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;A1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated superior efficacy in inducing apoptosis in p53 Y220C-mutant Huh7 cells and achieved a 61.06% reduction in tumor weight in Huh7 xenograft model. Our results demonstrated&#160;the viability of the DUBTAC strategy for p53 Y220C, successfully re-establishing conformation&#160;and promoting&#160;deubiquitination. More importantly, this study provides the first proof-of-concept for DUBTAC application&#160;in vivo, establishing targeted deubiquitination as a therapeutic approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scaleup Sodium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Ah&#8208;Level Pouch Cells Enable 100&#160;C Ultrafast Charging Capabilities</title>

Herein, we demonstrate the advanced electric double&#8208;layer capacitive storage by assembling a 1.6&#160;Ah SIC pouch cell, which delivers a high energy density of 42&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 in 0&#8211;3.4&#160;V, a high state of charge of 57% at 100&#160;C fast&#8208;charging rate, stable electrochemical cycles, and high safety.








Abstract
Traditional hybrid ion capacitors face the low capacity of electric double&#8208;layer (EDL) storage in narrow potential windows and the requirement of prelithiation (or presodiation) for practical device fabrication. Herein, we demonstrate that the activated carbon negative electrode (AC NE) maintains EDL capacitive behavior without the influence of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers in a wide potential window of 3&#8211;0.05&#160;V vs. Na+/Na. Remarkably, the AC NE displays an ultrahigh EDL capacitive storage capacity of 145&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (177&#160;F g&#8722;1), a high initial coulombic efficiency of 95.6%, capacitor&#8208;level ultrahigh rate capabilities and excellent cycling stability. Importantly, we assemble a 1.6&#160;Ah (1694&#160;F) SIC pouch cell, which delivers a high energy density of 42&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 (based on the total mass of the device), a high state of charge (SoC) of 57% at an ultrafast charging rate of 100&#160;C, stable 10000 electrochemical cycles and high safety (passing nailing penetration and thermal runaway tests). Additionally, the high&#8208;performance SIC is assembled without any presodiation treatment, which largely reduces manufacturing complexities and costs. Our work provides a significant milestone for the ultimate goal of electrochemical capacitors, which is increasing the energy density accompanied by capacitor&#8208;level high power density, long&#8208;term cyclability, and easy assembly.

         <title>Chiral Bifacial Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: A Homochiral Strategy to Improve Organic Solar Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop new bifacial chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). Through comparative investigations of four NFAs including meso, racemic, and chiral entries, we demonstrate the superiority of homochiral NFAs for the first time. In addition, pristine chiral NFAs films and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) with PBDB&#8208;T exhibit high spin polarization values of 50%&#8211;70% in the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effects. 








Abstract
Asymmetric design has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although most asymmetric NFAs focus on lateral (i.e., left&#8211;right) asymmetry, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy has remained underexplored, despite its ability to induce both a vertical dipole moment and molecular chirality, thereby potentially enabling functionalities such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). With this perspective, we develop chiral and bifacial NFAs, (S,S)&#8208;IE4F, and (R,R)&#8208;IE4F, featuring an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core bearing a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) group and a hydrophobic phenyl group on the bridging sp3&#8208;carbons. Their racemic counterpart (rac&#8208;IE4F) and a non&#8208;bifacial achiral isomer (meso&#8208;IE4F) are also synthesized as the controls. Compared to meso&#8208;IE4F, the bifacial isomers exhibit higher solubility, more favorable molecular packing for carrier transport, and larger dipole moments. Notably, neat (S,S)/(R,R)&#8208;IE4Fs and their bulk heterojunctions with PBDB&#8208;T exhibit pronounced CISS effect, with spin polarizations of &#8764;70% and &#8764;50%, respectively. Consequently, OSCs based on homochiral bifacial IE4Fs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 8.17%, three times higher than that of meso&#8208;IE4F. This study highlights the impact of isomerization in NFAs and provides a new molecular design strategy for homochiral asymmetric NFAs.

Bioinspired iron catalysis enables selective C(sp3)&#9472;H alkynylation via high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates, circumventing oxygen rebound to unlock direct functionalization of aliphatic feedstocks, natural products, and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
The development of synthetic catalysts capable of replicating cytochrome P450's remarkable C&#9472;H activation proficiency while suppressing oxygen rebound presents a fundamental challenge in catalysis, yet holds transformative potential for alkane functionalizations. Herein, we report an iron/EtBCMOM (L&#8208;cystine&#8208;based ligand) catalytic system for the selective distal methylene C(sp3)&#8208;H alkynylation of alkanes using alkynyl sulfones. This catalytic paradigm establishes a robust platform for the direct transformation of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds into versatile alkyne functionalities, exhibiting exceptional predictability in regioselectivity and accommodating an expansive substrate scope (&gt;60 structurally diverse examples). The technology unlocks previously inaccessible chemical space, enabling single&#8208;step derivatization of natural products, medicinally relevant molecules, and commodity feedstocks at traditionally unreactive positions.

         <title>Molecular Design of Nitrile Electrolytes Enabling Lithiated Silicon&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sulfur Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating polar nitrile with hydrofluoroether segments, a novel fluorinated nitrile electrolyte is developed which enhances Li+&#8211;anion coordination and suppresses polysulfide dissolution. This system promotes a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur reaction and stabilizes interfaces via additive&#8208;derived layers. It enables high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency in LiSi&#8722;S batteries over 100 cycles.








Abstract
The development of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is hindered by the polysulfide dissolving, cross&#8208;over and the inherent lithium metal anode instability.

&lt;p&gt;By integrating polar nitrile with hydrofluoroether segments, a novel fluorinated nitrile electrolyte is developed which enhances Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;anion coordination and suppresses polysulfide dissolution. This system promotes a quasi-solid-state sulfur reaction and stabilizes interfaces via additive-derived layers. It enables high-capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency in LiSi&#8722;S batteries over 100 cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is hindered by the polysulfide dissolving, cross-over and the inherent lithium metal anode instability. We herein instead describe a lithiated silicon&#8722;sulfur (LiSi&#8722;S) battery enabled by molecular engineering of highly solvating nitrile electrolytes toward weakly solvating to fundamentally decouple the reactions of the two electrodes and eliminate their cross-talk. Specifically, by controlled fluorination of the ethoxy-nitrile base solvent, the charge distribution on the solvent is manipulated which suppresses the solvation for polysulfides promoting a quasi-solid-state sulfur reaction (QSSSR) mechanism. The promoted anion participation in Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation, along with the fluoroethylene carbonate additive, further stabilizes the interphases at both sulfur cathode and LiSi anode mitigating the mechanical degradations. The QSSSR-based LiSi&#8722;S cell shows a high capacity of 1499.0&#160;mA h g&lt;sub&gt;sulfur&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1C, and achieves a high capacity retention of 90.2% over 100 cycles at 0.2C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Materials Created by Engineering a Continuum of P3HB Stereomicrostructures in a One&#8208;Step Catalytic Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereomeric mixtures of diolide were polymerized to P3HB mono&#8208;materials that behave like thermoplastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, which were then combined to create all&#8208;P3HB mono&#8208;material tapes.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;material products that combine multiple complementary polymers can create products with desired performance but present challenges to end&#8208;of&#8208;life (EoL) management. The emerging mono&#8208;material product design based on a single polymer type addresses the fundamental EoL issue, but challenges of delivering vastly tunable material properties by the single polymer still remain. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to produce biodegradable poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) materials with a wide range of material properties by engineering a stereomicrostructure continuum, achieved through polymerizing diastereomeric mixtures of racemic and meso&#8208;dimethyl diolides at various feed ratios with a single catalyst. This one&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot process produces biodegradable P3HB mono&#8208;materials ranging from rigid to flexible thermoplastics, to tough thermoplastic elastomers, to a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive (PSA), which have been then combined to fabricate prototype all&#8208;P3HB PSA tapes, demonstrating the feasibility of designing mono&#8208;material products through engineering polymer stereomicrostructures.

         <title>Synergistically Activating N2 and CO2 at Water Microdroplet Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the microdroplets interface can efficiently activate both N2 and CO2, with a significant mutual promotion effect observed between their activation processes. Mechanistic investigations reveal that oxygen radicals and CO2 are jointly involved in the nitrogen fixation process, offering a new strategy for spontaneous nitrogen fixation and CO2 conversion.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) fixation is essential for sustaining life but is challenging under ambient conditions. Industrial N2 fixation is energy&#8208;intensive and exacerbates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, while high concentration of atmospheric CO2 urgently requires scalable mitigation strategies. In this study, we report that simultaneous spontaneous activation of N2 and CO2 under ambient conditions in microdroplets, producing ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2&#8722;), and formate (HCO2&#8722;), as confirmed by isotopic labelling experiments and theoretical calculations. This can clarify the doubts about environmental ammonia pollution in microdroplets. The activation of N2 and CO2 exhibits a synergistic enhancement effect in microdroplets. Mechanistic investigation reveals novel pathways involving the CO2&#8208;facilitated N2 fixation and the oxygen radical (&#8226;O)&#8208;mediated N2 fixation. This discovery offers a sustainable pathway for green N2 fixation and atmospheric CO2 utilization, and offers insights into the potential formation pathway of HONO in the atmosphere.

Azobenzene&#8208;appended semiaza&#8208;bambusuril macrocycles act as light&#8208;gated anion channels. UVA and visible light toggle E/Z isomers, enabling reversible ON/OFF chloride transport in liposomes and cells. This photo&#8208;switchable system offers a new design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular therapeutics.








Abstract
The ability to control ion transport across membranes in living systems by stimulus&#8208;responsive natural channels, such as channelrhodopsins and their mimics, is a revolutionary tool for understanding biological processes. Herein, we demonstrate a new class of azo&#8208;functionalized bambusurils (azo&#8208;BUs) that act as efficient, photo&#8208;switchable anion channels capable of modulating chloride flux across lipid membranes and within cellular environments. The (E)&#8208;isomer exhibits pronounced chloride transport activity, which can be reversibly toggled via light&#8208;induced isomerization, enabling precise spatiotemporal control. Mechanistic studies reveal that the (E)&#8208;form induces apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen spieces (ROS) generation, and cytochrome c release, while also disrupting lysosomal acidification via H&#8314;/Cl&#8722; cotransport. This dual perturbation of cytosolic and lysosomal ion homeostasis underscores the compound's multifaceted cytotoxic mechanism. In contrast, the (Z)&#8208;isomer displayed minimal transport activity and negligible cytotoxicity, reinforcing its role as the inactive, photo&#8208;switchable OFF state in this system. The ability to control transport activity with light positions azo&#8208;BUs as promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation, stimuli&#8208;responsive anticancer agents. This work introduces a reversible photo&#8208;gated anion channel with therapeutic potential, offering a powerful platform for studying membrane transport and designing light&#8208;responsive biomedical tools.

         <title>Recyclable Turing&#8208;Structured Polymer Electrolytes for Sustainable Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable Turing&#8208;structured polymer electrolytes (TPEs) were prepared at gas/liquid/solid interface through evaporation/diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The Turing structure provides periodic Li ion&#8208;enriching microdomains that assemble shortened, ordered pathways into 3D percolating ion&#8208;conduction network. TPEs enable stable cycling performance in various solid&#8208;state batteries, alongside excellent self&#8208;healing, flame&#8208;retardant, and recyclable properties.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) face critical limitations in ionic conductivity, ion transference numbers, and recyclability. We report a recyclable Turing&#8208;structured polymer electrolyte (TPE) prepared at gas/liquid/solid interface through evaporation/diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The Turing structure provides fast ion&#8208;conduction surfaces/channels with periodic lithium (Li)&#8208;ion (Li+) self&#8208;concentration domains to enable a 3D percolating Li+ conduction, reducing migration barriers to achieve a high Li+ conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and transference number (0.61). TPEs enable stable cycling performance in various solid&#8208;state batteries at low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), alongside excellent self&#8208;healing, flame&#8208;retardant, and recyclable properties. Closed&#8208;loop recycling recovers 86.5% of polymer precursors and 82.6% of costly Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt, with regenerated electrolytes retaining their initial performance. These results highlight the potential of Turing structure as a scalable design paradigm for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage and conversion systems.

&lt;p&gt;Recyclable Turing-structured polymer electrolytes (TPEs) were prepared at gas/liquid/solid interface through evaporation/diffusion-driven instability. The Turing structure provides periodic Li ion-enriching microdomains that assemble shortened, ordered pathways into 3D percolating ion-conduction network. TPEs enable stable cycling performance in various solid-state batteries, alongside excellent self-healing, flame-retardant, and recyclable properties.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) face critical limitations in ionic conductivity, ion transference numbers, and recyclability. We report a recyclable Turing-structured polymer electrolyte (TPE) prepared at gas/liquid/solid interface through evaporation/diffusion-driven instability. The Turing structure provides fast ion-conduction surfaces/channels with periodic lithium (Li)-ion (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) self-concentration domains to enable a 3D percolating Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction, reducing migration barriers to achieve a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#160;&#176;C) and transference number (0.61). TPEs enable stable cycling performance in various solid-state batteries at low-temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), alongside excellent self-healing, flame-retardant, and recyclable properties. Closed-loop recycling recovers 86.5% of polymer precursors and 82.6% of costly Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt, with regenerated electrolytes retaining their initial performance. These results highlight the potential of Turing structure as a scalable design paradigm for sustainable and high-performance energy storage and conversion systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Heat to Electrons: Bridging Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;Phase Thermal and Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Ethylene Glycol over Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aerobic liquid&#8208;phase thermal oxidation of ethylene glycol and its electrocatalytic oxidation resulted in the same product distribution using mesostructured Co3O4. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal analogous surface intermediates requiring Co3+ centers and OH&#8722; species with O2 or the anodic potential regenerating the reduced active sites.








Abstract
The selective oxidation of alcohols under thermal and electrocatalytic conditions presents a promising route to value&#8208;added chemicals using sustainable energy sources. We establish mechanistic convergence between heterogeneous liquid&#8208;phase thermal oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) and its electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (EGOR) using mesostructured Co3O4 synthesized via hard templating as a catalyst. Comprehensive catalytic performance assessments and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal analogous surface intermediates and pathways in both regimes, resulting in the same product distribution. Co3+ centers and OH&#8722; species facilitate oxidation via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), with molecular oxygen or the applied anodic potential regenerating active sites. Product selectivity to glycolate, formate, and oxalate is governed by temperature, EG concentration, pH, applied O2 pressure, or potential. Surface and bulk characterization confirm the robustness of the spinel structure, enabling multiple catalyst recycling. These insights provide a first mechanistic framework connecting heterogeneous thermal and electrocatalytic oxidation over non&#8208;noble metal oxide catalysts, paving the way for designing multi&#8208;functional materials for chemical synthesis under electrothermal conditions.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Induced Crystal Symmetry Breaking and Lattice Distortion in Hybrid Cu(I) Halides for Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by symmetry&#8208;breaking principles, we developed a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to engineer asymmetric structures in Cu(I) halides, enhancing lattice distortion and charge transfer for superior STE emission. This approach achieved a 138% improvement in emission efficiency with a near&#8208;unity PLQY of 99%, a 187% boost in radioluminescence, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging (29 lp/mm) in(C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6 single&#8208;crystal films.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides have emerged as promising scintillators due to their efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission. However, the radiative efficiency of STE emission is mainly determined by structural distortion, making it challenging to precisely control the distortion for optimal luminescence. Here, inspired by symmetry&#8208;breaking principles, we developed a universal asymmetric structure transformation strategy through mixed&#8208;ligand engineering to modulate structural distortion and enhance intramolecular charge transfer, thereby boosting radiative STE emission. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that this mixed&#8208;ligand approach effectively tunes bond lengths and angles, intensifying structural distortion while simultaneously promoting charge transfer for improved luminescence. By optimizing structural distortion, the (C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6 crystal achieved a 138% enhancement in emission efficiency with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99% PLQY). Consequently, the &#8203;radioluminescence intensity increased by 187%, reaching 2.67 times light output that of (Lu, Y)2SiO5: Ce (LYSO). Owing to this remarkable improvement in radioluminescence, large&#8208;area (C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6 single&#8208;crystal films with low light scattering exhibited outstanding X&#8208;ray imaging performance, achieving a spatial resolution exceeding 29 lp/mm, 2.64 times higher than that of (C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6@PMMA films (11 lp/mm). This work establishes mixed&#8208;ligand engineering as an effective approach for structural asymmetry design and demonstrates the material's potential for advanced radiation detection and imaging.

         <title>Lattice Hydrogen Engineering Unlocks Inert TiO2 for H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice hydrogen implantation strategy is introduced to resolve the core thermodynamic and kinetic bottlenecks in neutral 2e&#8208; ORR electrosynthesis. This approach creates dual&#8208;function active sites within inert metal oxides that serve as intrinsic proton reservoirs, establishing a universal design principle for sustainable, scalable H2O2 production.








Abstract
Electrochemical H2O2 production through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) represents a transformative route for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis. Nevertheless, conventional catalysts struggle to achieve optimal intermediates adsorption and efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) under neutral conditions, as the sluggish dissociation of water imposes a severe kinetic bottleneck. Herein, we introduce a lattice hydrogen engineering strategy that confers unprecedented catalytic functionality to traditionally inert metal oxides. Through precise hydrogen implantation into the TiO2 lattice, we establish Ti&#8208;O2C&#8208;H active centers&#8212;a dual&#8208;function motif that simultaneously achieves near&#8208;ideal OOH* adsorption (positioned at the Sabatier volcano apex) and intrinsic proton reservoir capability. This atomically engineered H&#8208;TiO2 catalyst delivers&#160;&gt;&#160;95% H2O2 selectivity, operating stably for over 100 h at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This robust operation yields a high H2O2 production rate of 13,968&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with an energy efficiency of 41.3%. Crucially, the universality of lattice hydrogen engineering is demonstrated through the activation of WO3, MoO3, and Nb2O5, yielding comparable performance enhancements for neutral 2e&#8722; ORR. By unlocking metal oxides as a robust catalyst platform for H2O2 electrosynthesis, this work establishes a scalable pathway toward scalable, green and cost&#8208;effective peroxide production.

Stereodivergent access to spiropyrrolidine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with three skipped stereocenters is enabled by orchestrally integrating Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation with Ru&#8208;mediated asymmetric transfer hydrogenation/lactonization followed by a stereoselective imine reduction in a one&#8208;pot protocol, completing the three&#8208;dimensional chiral architectures that were otherwise inaccessible.








Abstract
The stereodivergent synthesis of spiroheterocycles bearing multiple stereocenters is a pivotal yet challenging frontier in asymmetric catalysis, particularly for rigid scaffolds integrating pharmacophoric pyrrolidine and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motifs with structural complexity and saturation. While the strategy of synergistic dual catalysis has advanced the stereodivergent construction of vicinal stereocenters, the precise control of 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in spirocyclic architectures remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report a bimetallic Cu/Ru sequential catalytic platform enabling stereodivergent access to spiropyrrolidine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with three skipped stereocenters. By orchestrally integrating Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation with Ru&#8208;mediated tandem asymmetric transfer hydrogenation/lactonization, this one&#8208;pot protocol achieves independent stereochemical control over two successively formed 1,3&#8208;stereocenters through sequential catalytic cycles. A stereoselective imine reduction further installs the third stereocenter with exceptional diastereoselectivity, completing the three&#8208;dimensional chiral architectures that were otherwise inaccessible. Control experiments validate the sequential catalytic pathway and reveal the essential role of Cs2CO3 in facilitating lactonization.

         <title>Constructing Robust Hydrogen Bond Networks in Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the dual role of the cosolvent as both a hydrogen donor and acceptor, together with the structure&#8208;making ability of SO42&#8722;, the H&#8208;bond anchoring effect is remarkably reinforced, leading to a substantial reduction in the reactivity of both H and O atoms. This synergistically suppresses V dissolution at the cathode and hydrogen evolution at the anode, thereby achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycling durability for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Hydrogen bonding in the aqueous electrolyte of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is a key factor dominating cycling stability due to the corrosive effects of water on both anode and cathode. Herein, we designed a robust, continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond network using ethylene glycol as a cosolvent and sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) as structure&#8208;making anion. Both hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms of water and ethylene glycol in the electrolyte are inter&#8208;anchored to mitigate the attack of O on a vanadium&#8208;based cathode and the attack of H on the zinc (Zn) anode. Furthermore, the entry of ethylene glycol into the Zn2+ solvation structure facilitates Zn2+ intercalation and improves the reversibility of byproducts arising from H+&#8208;insertion. As a result, excellent cycling performances was achieved in coin cells, with capacity retentions of 87% after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and 95% after 150 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest cycling stabilities reported to date. Moreover, a pouch cell with an area of 90 cm2 delivered a substantial capacity of 2 Ah and maintained 80% capacity retention after 70 cycles, highlighting the strong potential for practical scalability.

         <title>Streamlined Sugar Diversification via Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Alkylarylation of Glycals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise multi&#8208;site C&#8208;functionalization of carbohydrates poses a significant challenge. Herein, we have developed a C&#8208;alkylarylation reaction of glycals, achieving highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of the sugar. This strategy provides a wide range of novel and structurally diverse sugar&#8208;based molecules for carbohydrate drug discovery.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;site modification of sugars represents a highly promising strategy for constructing bioactive molecules in glycosciences. However, the modular assembly of diversifiable sugar architectures from readily available precursors remains a considerable challenge. Here, we disclosed a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed alkylarylation of glycals that achieves simultaneous diversification at the C1 and C2 positions of sugars. The reaction enables the synthesis of diverse 2&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl branched heteroaryl/aryl&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, including unprotected ones, with excellent regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, and stereoselectivities, and is compatible with an array of (hetero)&#8208;arenes and alkyl branches bearing a variety of functional groups. The utility is demonstrated through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the efficient downstream modifications on the easily functionalizable C2 alkyl branches and the C1 (hetero)&#8208;arenes, as well as the identification of a 2&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl phosphate aryl&#8208;C&#8208;glycoside as a potent antitumor agent through preliminary biological evaluation. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on radical trapping and Stern&#8211;Volmer luminescence experiments. Collectively, this study developed a modular, dual&#8208;functional sugar diversification platform that facilitates simultaneous Csp3&#9472;Csp2&#160;and Csp3&#9472;Csp3&#160;bond formation at the saccharide skeleton, which represents an alternative strategy for the rapid construction of complex carbohydrate derivatives for drug discovery.

         <title>Competing Dipolar and van der Waals Forces in Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing of Poly(Ionic Liquid) Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic responses of poly(ionic liquid) copolymers arising from the competing polar and dipolar forces is attributed to a balanced coexistence of ordered and disordered states involving the reversible rearrangements of H&#8208;bonding, ionic interactions, and London dispersion forces. Dynamic recovery from mechanical damage results from significant entropy increases causing energy dissipation and reversible segmental rearrangements.








Abstract
These studies elucidate the origin of molecular processes involved in the self&#8208;healing of imidazolium&#8208;based poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) subjected to dynamic surface oscillating forces (SOF). In contrast to their counterpart homopolymers, which are either brittle or exhibit irreversible responses, PILCs composed of short (&#8208;CH3; Me) and long (&#8211;CH)2)3CH3; Bu) aliphatic side chains attached to the cation&#8208;anion pair composed of a 50/50 monomer molar ratio (poly(Me/Bu 50/50)) exhibit remarkable recovery. These dynamic responses arise from the competing polar and dipolar forces attributed to a balanced coexistence of ordered and disordered states involving the reversible rearrangements of H&#8208;bonding, ionic interactions, and London dispersion forces. These copolymer composition&#8208;driven processes exhibit dynamic recovery due to significant entropy increases, causing energy dissipation and reversible segmental rearrangements to achieve energetically favorable states. Spectroscopic FT&#8208;IR measurements combined with 2D correlation spectroscopic (2D&#8208;COS) analysis supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal the significance of short&#8208; and long&#8208;forces involved in polar&#8208;dipolar interactions that enable dynamic recovery. The combination of directional and non&#8208;directional entropy&#8208;driven interchanges appears promising for identifying PILC architectures capable of mechanical adaptability, dynamic self&#8208;healing, and ionic conductivity.

         <title>Synthesis and Upcycling of All&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Backbone Degradable Polyethylene with Dispersed On&#8208;Chain Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;carbon&#8208;backbone photodegradable polyethylene (PE) is synthesized through incorporating phenyl ketone group into the on&#8208;chain of PE, which balances stability and degradability of PE material and possesses dispersed distribution of on&#8208;chain keto group. Under ambient UVA light, these polar, upgrading PE material achieves complete conversion of ketone with significantly higher efficiency, producing well&#8208;defined telechelic PE oligomers, which serve as intermediates for upcycling into value&#8208;added PLA&#8211;PE&#8211;PLA triblock copolymers.








Abstract
The challenges of photodegradable polyolefins, which have attracted much attention, persist in achieving controlled synthesis, efficient degradation, and chemical upcycling. Here, we report an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;backbone photodegradable polyethylene (PE) incorporating on&#8208;chain ketones through coordination&#8211;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and the optimal phenyl vinyl ketone (PVK).

     alt="Synthesis and Upcycling of All-Carbon-Backbone Degradable Polyethylene with Dispersed On-Chain Ketones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-carbon-backbone photodegradable polyethylene (PE) is synthesized through incorporating phenyl ketone group into the on-chain of PE, which balances stability and degradability of PE material and possesses dispersed distribution of on-chain keto group. Under ambient UVA light, these polar, upgrading PE material achieves complete conversion of ketone with significantly higher efficiency, producing well-defined telechelic PE oligomers, which serve as intermediates for upcycling into value-added PLA&#8211;PE&#8211;PLA triblock copolymers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges of photodegradable polyolefins, which have attracted much attention, persist in achieving controlled synthesis, efficient degradation, and chemical upcycling. Here, we report an all-carbon-backbone photodegradable polyethylene (PE) incorporating &lt;i&gt;on-chain&lt;/i&gt; ketones through coordination&#8211;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and the optimal phenyl vinyl ketone (PVK). This strategy enables precise control over the chain structure, including PVK dispersed distribution (0.3&#8211;8.3 mol%), saturated C&lt;sup&gt;sp3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;sp3&lt;/sup&gt; backbone, and enhanced surface properties while retaining thermomechanical properties. Crucially, this is the first report that achieves the quantitative conversion (100%) of ketone units in photodegradable PE under ambient UVA light (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; = 390&#8211;395&#160;nm) with high efficiency. Mechanistic studies on photodegradation reveal two competitive pathways: Norrish Type II scission and Norrish&#8211;Yang cyclization (&#8764;50% for each), yielding well-defined telechelic PE oligomers.

         <title>A Chemically Engineered Macrocyclic Peptide Shuttle Overcomes Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier in Aging Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuron&#8208;targeting, perfluoroalkane&#8208;constrained macrocyclic peptide shuttle is reported to efficiently penetrate the aged blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) for cargo delivery with high biosafety by harnessing the caveolae&#8208;dependent transcytosis, a mechanism potentiated in the aging brain.








Abstract
The blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) poses a major challenge for the delivery of therapeutics into the central nervous system. Receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis (RMT) is a highly efficient strategy for delivering therapeutics across the BBB. However, the age&#8208;dependent downregulation of key endothelial receptors limits its efficacy in age&#8208;related disorders. This underscores the urgent need to develop age&#8208;adapted strategies to enhance BBB traversal. Here, we report the discovery of a neuron&#8208;targeting macrocyclic peptide shuttle that actively triggers caveolae&#8208;mediated transcytosis, a pathway potentiated in brain endothelial cells during aging, through chemically engineered cross&#8208;linking architectures with tuned lipophilicity. In vivo evaluations in aged murine models revealed that the perfluoroalkane&#8208;tethered macrocycle achieves superior BBB traversal efficiency over current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art receptor&#8208;mediated BBB peptide shuttles, with high biosafety. Importantly, our findings establish that the perfluoroalkane&#8208;containing architecture confers an optimal balance between BBB permeability and nonspecific cytotoxicity. This macrocycle shuttle platform provides a dual&#8208;function delivery system for both efficient BBB traversal and neuron&#8208;targeting in the aging brain, showing promise as a therapeutic delivery strategy for age&#8208;related neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Orientation&#8208;Engineered Anderson&#8208;Type Polyoxometalate Sub&#8208;1 nm Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>

In this work, Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 sub&#8208;1&#160;nm nanosheets (Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 SNSs) with different ZnMo6O24H6 (ZnMo6) building block arrangements were successfully synthesized through cluster self&#8208;assembly strategy. Different building block site exposures altered the lithium storage activity and charge storge mechanism of Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 SNSs.








Abstract
The unique atomic&#8208;scale active site exposure of two&#8208;dimensional sub&#8208;1&#160;nm nanosheets (2D SNSs) effectively shorten the electron/ion diffusion distance, significantly enhancing the rapid charge&#8211;discharge performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is still challenging to precisely regulate the exposed sites of the building blocks. Herein, Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 sub&#8208;1&#160;nm nanosheets (Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 SNSs) were successfully synthesized through the cluster self&#8208;assembly strategy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed two stable configurations (Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;1 and Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;0.05) with distinct active sites exposure. Notably, Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;1 exhibited excellent performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anodes, with a reversible capacity of 1361.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, significantly outperforming Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;0.05 (258.5&#160;mAh g&#8722;1). Electrochemical mechanism and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the terminal&#8208;oxygen (Ot) sites exposed in Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;1 enabled optimal lithium&#8208;ions adsorption (Eads&#160;=&#160;&#8722;6.54&#160;eV), which facilitated rapid lithium storage behavior and exhibited exceptional redox reversibility. This study would provide a promising novel approach for the design and synthesis of 2D SNSs at molecule level.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalyzed Exothermic Binder Enables Ultrafast Processing and Migration&#8208;Resistant Binder Networks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;catalyzed exothermic resin (ExoR) binder achieves ultrafast (3 min) and energy&#8208;efficient (70% saving vs. polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. It suppresses binder migration and delivers near&#8208;theoretical capacity in LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, with compatibility extending to other cathode materials.








Abstract
Scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;performance cathodes is crucial for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, conventional binders such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) require prolonged drying, which slows electrode production and induces binder migration. Herein, we report a self&#8208;catalyzed exothermic resin (ExoR) binder that undergoes rapid, thermally triggered polymerization, completing network cross&#8208;linking within 3&#160;min while consuming 70% less drying energy than PVDF. Thermal and microstructural analyses confirm rapid ExoR polymerization and complete solvent removal, while revealing a uniform binder distribution and a continuous carbon&#8208;binder domain. This architecture lowers interfacial resistance and restrains polarization, producing an enhanced electrochemical response. The ExoR&#8208;LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode achieves a near&#8208;theoretical specific capacity at 0.1 C and excellent cycling stability, maintaining 155&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 with 95.5% retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (20 mg cm&#8722;2) ExoR&#8208;LFP cathodes deliver 2.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 areal capacity while preserving structural integrity. The ExoR binder also performs well with LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC111) and Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (LMRO) cathodes, demonstrating broad compatibility across diverse chemistries. By concurrently improving manufacturing efficiency and electrochemical performance, this nearly fluorine&#8208;free (0.05 wt.%) ExoR system provides a scalable and sustainable strategy for the high&#8208;throughput production of advanced lithium&#8208;ion cathodes.

Alkenylthianthrenium salts react as dipolarophiles and serve as synthetic equivalents of strained cycloalkynes, enabling efficient access to diverse 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles upon cycloaddition&#8211;elimination with azides. This strategy bypasses unstable cycloalkyne intermediates and provides a platform for fused&#8208;ring heterocycles and triazolium&#8208;functional polymers from simple alkene precursors.








Abstract
Cycloalkynes are highly reactive coupling partners in a variety of cycloaddition manifolds, but the synthetic utility of cycloalkynes with fewer than 8 atoms is limited by their fleeting stability. To expand access to heterocycles derived from formal cycloadditions to cycloalkynes, we have developed a methodology in which alkenylthianthrenium salts are used as synthetic equivalents of cycloalkynes in reactions with azides. This methodology enables expedient access to a variety of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from alkene building blocks in two steps, including triazoles fused with 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and 8&#8208;membered carbocycles. Rather than serving as precursors to in situ&#8208;generated alkynes, we discovered that many alkenylsulfonium salts react with azides as dipolarophiles, generating 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via a distinct cycloaddition&#8211;elimination mechanism. We show that this methodology is viable for both acyclic and cyclic alkenylsulfonium salts and demonstrate its applications as a tool for the synthesis of new small molecule heterocycles and functional polymeric materials.

         <title>Synthetic Motifs for Understanding Lewis Acid Interactions with Persulfides and Thioselenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

Using isolated dichalcogenides as precursors, we report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of Zn persulfide and thioselenide complexes. 77Se NMR shows distinct impacts to electronic structure and reactivity between different thioselenides coordinated to different Lewis acids.








Abstract
Persulfides (RSS&#8211;) and thioselenides (RSSe&#8211;) play important roles in biological S and Se transfer reactions, and their interactions with Lewis acidic moieties exert control over reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis and reactivity of mononuclear Zn2+ persulfide and thioselenide complexes from a unified synthetic strategy of using isolable dichalcogenide precursors. Highlighting the benefits of replacing S with Se, we use 77Se NMR spectroscopy to reveal the effects of Lewis acid coordination (K+, Na+, Zn2+) on the electronic environment of the terminal Se of the thioselenide (R&#8211;S&#946;&#8211;Se&#945;&#8211;). Coordination of RSSe&#8211; to Zn2+ polarizes the Se&#9472;S bond, rendering the internal sulfur atom (R&#8211;S&#946;&#8211;Se&#945;&#8211;) susceptible to nucleophilic attack and resulting in selenide (Se2&#8211;) release. We also prepared a mononuclear Zn2+ persulfide complex and probed differences in persulfide nucleophilicity when compared to the parent thiolate. Alkylation of the Zn2+ persulfide is considerably faster than the Zn2+ thiolate, supporting the proposed nucleophilicity enhancement of persulfides due to the &#945;&#8208;effect, and&#160;providing new insights into persulfide reactivity when coordinated to metals. Taken together, these investigations highlight the utility of small molecule synthetic models in advancing insights into the biological chemistry of metal dichaclogenides.

Carbon Insertion: An unprecedented visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ring expansion of cyclic oximes through a photochemical aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement, mediated by energy transfer catalysis has been developed. This diradical&#8208;mediated photochemical rearrangement provides a mild and efficient synthetic route and expands the toolbox of radical&#8208;based ring expansions, complementing classical approaches such as the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction.








Abstract
Skeletal editing has emerged as a transformative strategy for manipulating cyclic architectures, with radical&#8208;based approaches providing particularly mild and versatile routes. While significant progress has been made, molecular editing via diradical intermediates under visible&#8208;light irradiation remains rare. Herein, we report an unprecedented visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ring expansion of cyclic oximes through a photochemical aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement, mediated by energy transfer catalysis. This diradical&#8208;mediated photochemical rearrangement provides a mild and efficient synthetic route, exhibiting broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and versatile downstream reactivity of the rearranged scaffolds. The transformation can also be conducted under photochemical continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Mechanistic studies support a stepwise sequence involving triplet diradical formation, a challenging 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization, &#946;&#8208;scission elimination, and diradical recombination. This method expands the toolbox of radical&#8208;based ring expansions, complementing classical approaches such as the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Silver Bimetallic Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks with Unique Intermediate Interlayer Transfer Effects for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 to Ethylene Conversion</title>

A Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic metal&#8211;covalent organic framework with unique intermediate interlayer transfer effects was developed for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2H4. In the catalytic process, Ag sites primarily facilitate CO generation, while neighboring Cu sites promote C&#9472;C bond formation, thus achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 51.5%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9% for C2H4 at a reduction potential of &#8208;1.774&#160;V vs. RHE

Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4) offers a promising approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while generating high&#8208;value chemical products. However, achieving both high C2H4 selectivity and long&#8208;term catalyst stability remains a significant challenge for single&#8208;atom catalysts, primarily due to the absence of adjacent active sites required for the coupling of reaction intermediates. Herein, a bimetallic metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with precisely tunable Cu&#8208;Ag spatial configurations was developed to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion through a synergistic catalytic mechanism. By optimizing the Cu/Ag molar ratio to 1:1 (Ag0.5Cu0.5&#8208;CTC&#8208;TAPT), the catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 (FE(C2H4)) of 51.5%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9% at a reduction potential of &#8208;1.774&#160;V versus (vs.)&#160;RHE, along with a current density of 439.0&#160;&#177;&#160;7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability (FE(C2H4)&#160;&gt;&#160;40% over 10 h), outperforming most single&#8208;metal M/COFs and MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts that predominantly yield C1 products. In situ spectroscopic analysis and mechanistic studies indicate that Ag sites primarily facilitate CO generation, while neighboring Cu sites promote C&#9472;C bond formation. This work introduces a novel design strategy for constructing COF&#8208;based materials with adjacent heterogeneous metal active sites, highlighting their significant potential for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable C2+ chemicals.

Through intentional copper doping, the PLQY was enhanced from 0.8% to near unity, accompanied by bright cyan circularly polarized luminescence and efficient second harmonic generation.








Abstract
Chiral metal halides featuring circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have drawn considerable attention due to their promising applications in imaging, sensing, and photonics. However, such materials largely rely on chiral organic cations, and technically significant cyan CPL remains out of reach. Here, we report an enantiomeric pair of zero&#8208;dimensional chiral silver halides, P/M&#8208;(MTP)2AgI3 (MTP&#160;=&#160;methyltriphenylphosphonium), constructed from achiral MTP+ cations and distorted triangular&#8208;planar [AgI3]2&#8722; units. Further intentional doping with copper(I) ions not only suppresses nonradiative recombination but also introduces additional emissive centers, leading to photoluminescence quantum yield enhanced from 0.8% to near unity and enabling bright cyan CPL with a large dissymmetry factor glum of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Moreover, the intrinsic non&#8208;centrosymmetry of this material enables efficient second harmonic generation, together with a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 52.6&#160;mJ cm&#8722;2. This study offers new insights into the design of chiral metal halides with rich chiroptical and nonlinear optical effects.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Driven Circularly Polarized Luminescence Sign Inversion in Chiral Bispyrene Based Cocrystals with Optical Waveguide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest insertion in chiral bispyrene enforces an &#8220;open&#8221; conformation with negative circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), while &#8220;closed&#8221; assemblies give positive CPL. Solvent&#8208;vapor stimuli induce reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;polymorph transitions accompanied by CPL switching. All chiral bispyrene&#8208;based microcrystals act as low&#8208;loss optical waveguides, highlighting opportunities for integrated photonic circuits.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials hold great promise for advanced photonic applications, yet achieving dynamic control over both the luminescent dissymmetry factor (glum) and wavelength remains a substantial challenge. Conventional approaches to CPL inversion often require the intricate synthesis of enantiomers or depend on specific crystal orientation effects. Herein, we propose a supramolecular cocrystal engineering approach to achieve conformation&#8208;driven CPL inversion alongside multicolor emission. The resulting single&#8208;crystals (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;CPYM and cocrystals (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;CPY/OFN, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;CPY/TPF, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;CPY/TCNB exhibited tunable emission ranging from 441 nm to 591 nm, arising from arene&#8208;perfluoroarene and charge&#8208;transfer interactions. Crucially, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that OFN and TCNB guests insert between the pyrene rings of the host (R,R)&#8208;CPY, enforcing an &#8220;open&#8221; conformation and yielding negative CPL signals. By contrast, TFP does not insert, preserving the &#8220;closed&#8221; conformation and producing in positive CPL of (R,R)&#8208;CPY/TFP. Furthermore, a reversible vapor&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;polymorphism transformation was demonstrated, enabling switchable CPL. All microcrystals functioned as low&#8208;loss optical waveguides from 0.0189 to 0.0471 dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, underscoring their potential for integrated photonic circuits. This work provides a robust strategy for designing multifunctional chiroptical materials with controllable CPL signs through conformation regulation in cocrystal system for applications in photonics and sensing.

         <title>Electrochemical Azolation of Electron&#8208;rich Fluoroarenes: A Controlled Redox Chain Unlocks C&#9472;N Bond&#8208;forming e&#8208;SNAr</title>

         <dc:description>
Anodic oxidation unlocks C&#9472;N bond formation in electron&#8208;rich fluoroarenes. Spatial separation of redox events extends the lifetime of active intermediates, expands the scope of nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and promotes a new mechanism for SNAr reactions: uphill redox catalysis. Powered by voltage control, azolation occurs quickly and selectively; reactions proceed with catalytic charge and can be easily scaled in a batch setup.








Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions are critical methods for forming C&#9472;N bonds in synthetic campaigns, but limitations in electrophile electronics restrict access to a large portion of chemical space. Photochemical oxidation of fluoroarenes has emerged as an attractive strategy to activate fluoroarenes toward nucleophilic addition, but back&#8208;electron transfer to solution&#8208;phase reduced photocatalysts limit the scope and efficiency of these methods. Herein, we describe an electrochemical strategy to overcome this obstacle by spatially separating redox events at electrode surfaces, extending the lifetime of the activated electrophile and enabling the azolation of electron&#8208;rich alkoxyfluoroarenes. Through stabilization of the oxidized product with voltage control and HFIP solvent, the reaction proceeds with catalytic charge via a proposed uphill redox chain mechanism. A wide range of electron&#8208;rich fluoroarenes and azoles are tolerated&#8212;including those with orthogonal functional group handles. The redox catalytic nature of this e&#8208;SNAr reaction enables energy and mass efficient syntheses and facile scaling in a simple batch setup.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorus Radical Transformations for the Assembly of P&#8208;Stereogenic Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective copper&#8208;photoredox catalytic platform enables enantioselective generation of metal&#8208;bound P&#8208;centered radicals and their stereoretentive transformations within a precisely defined chiral environment. This strategy not only enables efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant P&#8208;chiral molecules but also provides mechanistic insights into heteroatom&#8208;centered asymmetric radical chemistry.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals hold transformative potential for organophosphorus synthesis, yet their configurational lability and distinctive reactivity profiles have historically restricted their application in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;photoredox catalytic system that enables the stereoselective generation of copper&#8208;bound P&#8208;centered radicals and their subequent stereoretentive transformations within a well&#8208;defined chiral environment. The synergistic approach achieves unprecedented kinetic resolutions of racemic H&#8208;phosphinates with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes or gem&#8208;difluorostyrenes, delivering 85 fluorine&#8208;containing P&#8208;chiral phosphinates with up to 98%&#160;ee. The method thereby bridges a synthetic gap for these previously inaccessible, pharmacologically significant compounds. Mechanistic and computational studies reveal a stereochemical relay: enantiodiscriminatory binding of racemic substrates, photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) for radical generation, and stereoretentive bond formation. By reconciling radical reactivity with stereochemical fidelity, our strategy establishes metallaphotoredox catalysis as a versatile paradigm for heteroatom&#8208;centered stereochemistry.

         <title>Reversible Monoclinic Transition Buffering and Stepwise Uniform Delithiation in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;modification of Zr doping and Li3NbO4 coating stabilizes the buffer monoclinic phase in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. The regulated M&#8596;H transitions suppress lattice distortion, promote stepwise uniform delithiation, and prevent Li&#8208;sufficient/deficient phase segregation. This structural engineering yields superior cyclability with reduced voltage decay and enhanced thermal/air stability, offering a strategy to advance high&#8208;energy Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are promising high&#8208;energy cathodes but suffer from severe structural degradation during cycling, particularly due to irreversible phase transitions and interfacial instability. While extensive studies focus on the hexagonal (H) phase transition, the intermediate monoclinic (M) phase plays a critical yet overlooked role in mediating lattice strain and enabling ordered delithiation. Stabilizing the M phase remains challenging in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes due to linked bulk and surface degradation. Herein, we report stabilization of LiNiO2 by combining Zr doping and Li3NbO4 coating, which respectively suppresses anisotropic lattice distortion by forming Li/Ni superlattices and provides uniform protection on primary particles. This dual&#8208;modification effectively inhibits NiO6 bond length/angle dispersion within M phase, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller activity and establishing a reversible transition buffer that accommodates lattice strain and guides moderated M&#8596;H conversion, thereby functioning as a structural bridge to ensure continuous symmetry recovery. The modified cathode achieves a stepwise uniform delithiation with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Li distribution, preventing separation into Li&#8208;sufficient and Li&#8208;deficient areas and delivering enhanced cycling stability with reduced voltage decay. This work demonstrates that M phase engineering is a promising strategy for developing ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes with high energy density and prolonged stability.

&lt;p&gt;Dual-modification of Zr doping and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NbO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coating stabilizes the buffer monoclinic phase in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. The regulated M&#8596;H transitions suppress lattice distortion, promote stepwise uniform delithiation, and prevent Li-sufficient/deficient phase segregation. This structural engineering yields superior cyclability with reduced voltage decay and enhanced thermal/air stability, offering a strategy to advance high-energy Ni-rich cathodes.

         <title>Cis&#8208;Trans Isomerism Revealed in Circularly Polarized Luminescent Superatomic Ag28 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, cis&#8208;trans isomerism R&#8208;Ag28&#8208;cis/trans and S&#8208;Ag28&#8208;cis/trans were introduced into CPL superatomic nanoclusters. SCXRD shows that the Ag28 cluster has a chiral core&#8208;shell structure Ag12@Ag14S12, and two AgS units are differently attached to the framework, resulting in the cis&#8208;trans isomerism. The distinctions in electronic structures and optical performance were revealed with the theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters facilitate the exploration of chiral origin in metal nanomaterials, meanwhile, their structural isomers with subtle variations serve as ideal models for investigating the structure&#8208;property relationship at the atomic level. Here, we obtained two pairs of chiral superatomic cis&#8208;trans isomers with the formula [R/S&#8208;Ag28(SOC10H15)14(CF3COO)10] (denoted as R/S&#8208;Ag28&#8208;cis/trans), where the cis and trans configurations coexist within the R and S chiral forms, respectively. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis revealed that Ag28 clusters adopt a chiral core&#8208;shell configuration of Ag12@Ag14S12, consisting of an Ag12 kernel encapsulated within a chiral Ag14S12 cage. The additional two AgS units are located in a different fashion on the flanks of the framework, leading to the cis&#8208;trans isomerism of the silver clusters. DFT calculation reveals the distinctions in electronic structures and optical absorptions of the cis&#8208;trans isomers. The enantiomeric R/S&#8208;Ag28 exhibit intense red phosphorescence at 740&#160;nm in the crystalline state, and hold a &#8764;28&#160;nm blueshift in solution. Furthermore, R/S&#8208;Ag28 display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity, achieving a maximum (|glum|) value of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 in the crystalline state. This study enriches the diversity of chiral superatomic clusters and introduces cis&#8208;trans isomerism in metal clusters, establishing a novel platform to explore structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Induced Cu Site Differentiation in Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalyst Enables Asymmetric CO&#9472;CHO Coupling for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Conversion</title>

Symmetric *CO&#9472;*CO coupling hinders CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion. We report a Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst where Pd atoms induce site differentiation on the Cu surface, creating two distinct sites. Pd&#8208;proximal sites promote *CO to *CHO protonation via H2O dissociation, while Pd&#8208;distal sites stabilize *CO. This strategy unlocks a highly efficient asymmetric CO&#9472;CHO coupling pathway, delivering a Faradiac efficiency of 78.8% (&#177;2.5%) for C2H4.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene (C2H4) presents a pivotal strategy for industrial decarbonization and carbon valorization but is persistently hindered by the intrinsic high kinetic barrier for symmetric *CO&#9472;*CO coupling on conventional Cu catalysts. To surmount this fundamental challenge, we synthesized a tandem Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst that achieves site differentiation of the surface Cu. The Pd1 atom induces electronic heterogeneity by creating two electronically distinct Cu sites. The Pd&#8208;proximal sites promote *CO protonation to *CHO by leveraging Pd assisted H2O dissociation, and Pd&#8208;distal sites stabilize *CO. This synergistic division unlocks a highly efficient asymmetric C&#9472;CHO coupling pathway. Operando spectroscopy and DFT calculations confirm that the engineered pathway lowers the critical C&#9472;C coupling barrier by &#8764;50%. The Pd1Cu/Ag&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst delivers a peak C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 78.8% (&#177;2.5%) with a partial current density of 441&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;0.97&#160;V versus RHE in a flow cell, while maintaining excellent operational stability. This work validates asymmetric CO&#9472;CHO coupling as a superior route for C2H4 electrosynthesis by introducing a generalizable design paradigm of precisely steering reaction pathways on multi&#8208;carbon electrocatalysts.

         <title>Polarized Heterojunction in a Doubly Doped Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Structure to Obtain an Organic Photovoltaic Device of 20.5% Efficiency</title>

A solvent&#8208;mediated infiltration doping strategy was proposed, enabling efficient double doping in organic photovoltaics. By spatially separating F4TCNQ and DMBI dopants within a D18/L8&#8208;BO layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer architecture, dopant crosstalk and trap formation are minimized by controlling the penetration depth. The resulting polarized heterojunction enhances charge transfer and transport, achieving 20.5% PCE and 82.3% FF in device.








Abstract
Achieving efficient double doping in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is hindered by parasitic interactions between p&#8208; and n&#8208;type dopants, which lead to radical accumulation, deep&#8208;level traps, and reduced device performance. Herein, we report a solvent&#8208;mediated infiltration doping strategy to overcome these challenges based on D18/L8&#8208;BO layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) system. By incorporating F4TCNQ as the p&#8208;type dopant in the donor layer and DMBI as the n&#8208;type dopant in the acceptor layer, with controlled infiltration via a chlorobenzene:ethanol (CB:EtOH) binary solvent mixture, we constructed a polarized heterojunction that mitigates dopant crosstalk. This approach reduces trap depths (activation energy Ea&#160;=&#160;0.2&#160;eV vs. 0.84&#160;eV for direct doping) and narrows lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) density of states while enhancing built&#8208;in potential and hole transfer rate (&#964;1&#160;=&#160;0.40&#160;ps). Consequently, the optimized devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.5%, with a fill factor (FF) of 82.3%, surpassing control (19.5%) and direct doping (19.1%) configurations. These findings highlight the efficacy of spatially controlled doping for advancing high&#8208;efficiency, scalable OPVs toward sustainable energy applications.

&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.40&#160;ps). Consequently, the optimized devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.5%, with a fill factor (FF) of 82.3%, surpassing control (19.5%) and direct doping (19.1%) configurations. These findings highlight the efficacy of spatially controlled doping for advancing high-efficiency, scalable OPVs toward sustainable energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Electric Field&#8208;Driven Reaction Pathway Regulation via Ru Single Atoms on Highly Curved Carbon Sphere for Stable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes &#8220;microenvironmental regulation of active sites&#8221; strategy to overcome low activity utilization caused by disordered reaction pathways for conventional&#160;single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in Li&#8211;O2 batteries. By leveraging the tailored metal&#8208;support interactions of unique SACs, function&#8208;driven oriented assembly of discharge intermediates into 3D cylindrical&#8208;like products is achieved, presenting a novel design paradigm for SAC systems towardspractical Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are extensively employed in Li&#8211;O2 batteries owing to their exceptional atomic utilization efficiency and precise active&#8208;site control, which collectively enhance battery performance. However, weak metal&#8208;support interactions impede effective anchoring and electronic state modulation, leading to suboptimal catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Herein, we report a Ru single&#8208;atom/onion&#8208;like carbon sphere (Ru SACs/OCS) catalyst designed to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This enhancement stems from the interplay of the local electric field induced by the tip effect, facilitating rapid mass transport of reactive species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results demonstrate that precise modulation of substrate nanostructure curvature significantly amplifies the local electric field intensity surrounding SACs on the support surface. This augmentation elevates surface charge density and active&#8208;site concentration of the catalyst, thereby promoting the preferential disproportionation of reaction intermediates at the catalyst surface. The proposed strategy offers a streamlined and effective approach to engineer SACs with highly curved heterostructures, enabling enhanced catalytic reactions in metal&#8722;air battery technologies.

A radical desymmetrizing cyclization of unactivated internal alkenes under copper catalysis was developed for the synthesis of a variety of 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan&#8208;3&#8208;ones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of a substrate&#8208;Cu(II) complex and indicate that nucleophilic radical addition to the coordinated alkene is the stereodetermining step.








Abstract
We herein report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical desymmetrizing cyclization of cyclopentenes through peroxidation&#8208;amination and alkylamination. This strategy provides a general and efficient route for the synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan&#8208;3&#8208;ones bearing one quaternary and two adjacent tertiary stereocenters in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The embedded peroxy and amide motifs allow a diverse of transformations, furnishing a library of structurally diverse analogues, including all four stereoisomers of 6&#8208;hydroxy derivatives. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of a substrate&#8208;Cu(II) complex and indicate that nucleophilic radical addition to the coordinated alkene is the key stereocontrolling step responsible for both enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Inner&#8208;Axial Chlorine Engineering Enables Efficient and Selective Phenol Electrocatalytic Upcycling to Benzoquinone on Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl catalyst efficiently upcycled aqueous phenol to valuable para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ), with CoN4 sites electronically regulated by inner&#8208;axial chlorine coordination. This modification facilitated charge transfer, optimized reaction thermodynamics, and synergistically promoted phenol adsorption and p&#8208;BQ desorption.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upcycling of aqueous phenol into value&#8208;added para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) provides a promising route for synergistic wastewater treatment and sustainable chemical synthesis. Nevertheless, previous attempts have primarily relied on noble metal&#8208;based (e.g., Pd, Ru) electrocatalysts, but struggled with high costs and low selectivity. We, herein, report a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst comprising carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported CoN4 sites coordinated with inner&#8208;axial chloride atoms (Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl), delivering 92.4% phenol conversion and 83.7% p&#8208;BQ yield under mild conditions. The superior electrocatalytic performance stems from inner&#8208;axial coordination of Cl, which fine&#8208;tunes the CoN4 site microenvironment and electronic structure. This modification enhances charge&#8208;transfer capacity, optimizes oxidation thermodynamics, and facilitates phenol adsorption and p&#8208;BQ desorption. The proposed electrocatalytic system with the Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl catalyst, maintains&#160;&gt;&#160;80.3% phenol conversion and&#160;&gt;&#160;70.7% p&#8208;BQ yield over 10 consecutive cycles. Furthermore, integrating the Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl catalyst into a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer enables efficiently operational stability. This work establishes a potential and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalytic approach to valorize phenolic wastewater through resource recovery.

         <title>Engineering Cyanoarene Photocatalysts to Resolve Deactivation Challenges in Organocatalyzed ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalyst (PC), 4DMDP&#8208;IPN, that overcomes intrinsic limitations of cyanoarene&#8208;based PCs in organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) by suppressing [PC&#8226;+&#8230;Br&#8722;] complexation and detrimental back electron transfer (BET). Isolation of 4DMDP&#8208;IPN&#8226;+PF6&#8722; confirmed the slowed BET, enabling well&#8208;controlled O&#8208;ATRP even at an ultra&#8208;low PC loading of 5&#160;ppm.








Abstract
Cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalysts (PCs) have been widely utilized in organic transformations including photo&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (CRP). Despite favorable photophysical and electrochemical properties, these PCs have exhibited limited efficacy in photoinduced organocatalyzed ATRP (O&#8208;ATRP). We identified that reduced performance arises from preferential formation of [PC&#8226;+&#8230;Br&#8722;] complexes, which facilitates detrimental back electron transfer (BET), generating bromine radicals and side reactions. To address this, we developed a new cyanoarene&#8208;based PC, 4DMDP&#8208;IPN, incorporating strongly electron&#8208;donating groups at donor moieties. This design effectively suppresses complex formation and alleviates BET, significantly improving O&#8208;ATRP performance. With 4DMDP&#8208;IPN, O&#8208;ATRP of methacrylates with high monomer conversion, narrow dispersity, and excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity, even at an ultra&#8208;low PC loading of 5&#160;ppm. This represents the lowest reported PC loading that still ensures polymerization control, eliminating the need for post&#8208;polymerization catalyst removal. Moreover, we demonstrated successful O&#8208;ATRP of poly(methyl acrylate), a particularly challenging monomer, with decent levels of control and chain&#8208;end fidelity. This work not only overcomes intrinsic limitations of cyanoarene&#8208;based PCs in O&#8208;ATRP, but also establishes a new design strategy for next&#8208;generation PCs. We anticipate that these findings will contribute significantly to the advancement of photo&#8208;CRP and broaden the applicability of cyanoarene&#8208;based PCs in a wide range of organic transformations.

         <title>Thermal Property Engineering in Mn&#8208;Based Hybrid Halides via Structural Tailoring of Phosphonium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing strategies such as carbon chain extension, branching increase, and structural isomerization, a series of Mn&#8208;based OIMHs with tunable melting temperature (110&#8211;257&#160;&#176;C) and glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA, 0.71&#8211;0.92) are successfully constructed, where the (4&#8208;BATBP)MnBr4 glass shows significant potential for high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray imaging applications.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide (OIMH) glasses have emerged as promising scintillator materials, distinguished by their exceptional optical transparency, straightforward synthesis, and tunable thermodynamic properties. The manufacturability and functional characteristics of these glasses are synergistically governed by the melting temperature (Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg), and decomposition temperature (Td), which can be effectively regulated through rational structural modulation. In this study, monophosphonium salts functionalized with secondary ammonium groups (&#9472;NH2+R) are prepared. By utilizing strategies such as carbon chain extension, branching increase, and structural isomerization, a series of Mn&#8208;based OIMHs with tunable Tm (110.0&#8211;256.6&#160;&#176;C) and Tg (78.7&#8211;101.7&#160;&#176;C) are successfully constructed. To probe into the structure&#8208;performance relationship, differential scanning calorimetry analysis and density functional theory calculations are conducted. Notably, the (4&#8208;BATBP)MnBr4&#183;2H2O crystal (4&#8208;BATBP2+ = 4&#8208;(n&#8208;butylamino)butyltriphenylphosphonium) exhibits the highest glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA, Tg/Tm&#160;=&#160;0.92). The corresponding (4&#8208;BATBP)MnBr4 glass scintillator demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 20&#8211;25 lp mm&#8722;1 under X&#8208;ray irradiation and retains excellent stability after prolonged heat treatment at 65&#160;&#176;C for 130 days, underscoring its significant potential for high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

         <title>Hybridized Host Functions in Polyaromatic Tube&#8208;in&#8208;Capsule Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of tube&#8208;in&#8208;capsule hybrid hosts is achieved in water through a combination of a polyaromatic tube and capsule. Rod&#8208;like aromatic dyes are selectively bound within the hybrid host, yielding ternary composites with high emission ability through spatial isolation of the dyes. Replacing the capsule with a chiral derivative affords chiral ternary composites with pronounced dye&#8208;based circularly polarized emission.








Abstract
Noncovalent hybridization of two types of host compounds has emerged as a promising strategy to develop unique functions, unattainable by either of the hosts. Here we report unusual spectroscopic features observed within a new hybrid host, formed by the combination of a polyaromatic tube and capsule, with rigid and flexible frameworks, respectively, in water. The resultant tube&#8208;in&#8208;capsule host selectively encapsulates rod&#8208;like aromatic dyes (e.g., BODIPY and coumarin derivatives), yielding ternary host&#8211;guest composites bearing a dye&#8208;in&#8208;tube structure. The ternary composites exhibit strong emission (up to &#934;F = &#8764;60%) from the bound dyes in water, with up to 45&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the corresponding dye&#8208;in&#8208;capsule composites, due to the spatial isolation of the dyes in the tubular cavities. Detailed host&#8211;guest studies using dye derivatives and partial tube structures clearly indicate the importance of the rod&#8208;like dye shape and tubular cavity for the present photofunctions. Furthermore, unusual remote chiroptical induction of encapsulated achiral dyes is readily demonstrated within a related hybrid host, where the achiral capsule is replaced with a chiral polyaromatic capsule. The dye&#8208;based, pronounced circularly polarized emission (|glum| = &#8764;3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3) is observed only in this hybridized host&#8211;guest system.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Enabled Double Borylation Strategy for &#960;&#8208;Extended MR&#8208;TADF Emitters: From Synthetic Challenge to Benchmark OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a concise and versatile synthetic strategy for multiple resonance (MR) emitters. In this approach, chlorine atoms play a &#8220;dual role&#8221;: they not only direct regioselective one&#8208;shot double borylation but also serve as reactive handles for derivatization, enabling facile tuning of physical properties. As a representative example, W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cz achieved ideal deep&#8208;green emission with record&#8208;high efficiencies at high luminance levels.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials are promising emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. However, realizing pure&#8208;green, narrowband emission with simultaneously high efficiency and stability remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for display applications. In this study, we report a concise one&#8208;shot double borylation strategy uniquely enabled by chlorine substituents acting as both directing and functional groups. This dual role not only ensures regioselective synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended multiple resonance (MR) framework&#8212;previously considered synthetically inaccessible&#8212;but also provides versatile handles for late&#8208;stage diversification. The resulting key intermediate, W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cl, was obtained in 48% yield and readily converted into a series of structurally diverse MR&#8208;TADF emitters through single&#8208;step derivatizations. These emitters exhibited narrowband emissions from deep green to yellow&#8208;green (FWHM 27&#8211;34&#160;nm) with tunable photophysical properties. Notably, TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence devices based on W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cz achieved an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.1%. More importantly, the device maintained record&#8208;high efficiencies of 34.3% and 29.5% at luminance levels of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best efficiency&#8211;brightness trade&#8208;off among reported green sensitized OLEDs. This work not only overcomes synthetic bottlenecks in accessing &#960;&#8208;extended MR&#8208;TADF frameworks but also establishes a versatile platform for color&#8208;tunable, high&#8208;performance OLEDs.

         <title>Integrating Fluorinated [BF4] Anion With &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Six&#8208;Membered Rings for Short&#8208;Wavelength UV Frequency Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

This work not only presents a high&#8208;performance melamine crystal for 266&#160;nm output but also demonstrates a synergistic assembly strategy using &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations and wide energy gap fluoride anions to balance the critical trade&#8208;off between band gap and nonlinearity in nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.








Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for the short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) region are vital for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers, particularly for generating 266&#160;nm light via the direct fourth harmonic generation. While organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered rings are key functional units, their typically narrow band gaps hinder short&#8208;wavelength UV application. In this study, we targeted melamine [C3H8N6] for its strong hyperpolarizability and combined it with the wide&#8208;energy gap fluorinated [BF4] tetrahedra to synthesize three new compounds. Among them, the non&#8208;centrosymmetric &#945;&#8208;phase, &#945;&#8208;C3H8N6(BF4)2&#183;(H2O), exhibits balanced properties: a short UV cutoff edge and a high powder second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiency of 6.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP, surpassing most known short&#8208;wavelength UV transparent melamine salts and hybrid crystals with &#960;&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered rings. More importantly, it achieves phase&#8208;matched 266&#160;nm generation with an efficiency &#8764;1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;that of classic BBO crystal. Theoretical calculations confirm that the [C3H8N6] cation is the primary source of the NLO response, while the fluorinated [BF4] anion is responsible for the wide band gap. This work not only presents a high&#8208;performance melamine crystal for 266&#160;nm output but also demonstrates a synergistic assembly strategy using &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations and wide energy gap fluoride anions to balance the critical trade&#8208;off between band gap and nonlinearity in NLO materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for the short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) region are vital for all-solid-state lasers, particularly for generating 266&#160;nm light via the direct fourth harmonic generation. While organic planar &#960;-conjugated six-membered rings are key functional units, their typically narrow band gaps hinder short-wavelength UV application. In this study, we targeted melamine [C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] for its strong hyperpolarizability and combined it with the wide-energy gap fluorinated [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] tetrahedra to synthesize three new compounds. Among them, the non-centrosymmetric &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-phase, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), exhibits balanced properties: a short UV cutoff edge and a high powder second-harmonic generation efficiency of 6.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP, surpassing most known short-wavelength UV transparent melamine salts and hybrid crystals with &#960;-conjugated six-membered rings. More importantly, it achieves phase-matched 266&#160;nm generation with an efficiency &#8764;1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;that of classic BBO crystal. Theoretical calculations confirm that the [C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cation is the primary source of the NLO response, while the fluorinated [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] anion is responsible for the wide band gap. This work not only presents a high-performance melamine crystal for 266&#160;nm output but also demonstrates a synergistic assembly strategy using &#960;-conjugated cations and wide energy gap fluoride anions to balance the critical trade-off between band gap and nonlinearity in NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline 90&#176;&#8208;Twisted Carbon&#8208;Centered Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; Diradical Derived from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>

We report the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis of a triplet TME analog [(IPrMe&#8208;CDY)2C]2 (3) derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Unlike transient TME, diradical 3 shows indefinite stability under an inert atmosphere. Consequently, our findings not only present an opportunity for further exploration of the electronic properties associated with TME but also enable potential applications in molecular magnetic materials.








Abstract
Diradicals, molecules with two unpaired electrons, are crucial for understanding chemical reaction mechanisms, bond formation, and bond dissociation. Beyond their fundamental importance, they are increasingly studied for potential applications in batteries, luminescent materials, solar cells, and organic spintronic devices. As an essential property, determining the electronic ground state&#8212;singlet or triplet&#8212;of diradicals is critical for understanding their reactivity, physical properties, and spin&#8211;spin interactions. Tetramethyleneethane (TME), a prototypical disjoint non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical, has long attracted attention; however, its ground state remains controversial because it is highly unstable. Here, by appending four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;functionalized p&#8208;phenylene units to an olefin skeleton, we prepared a TME analog that exhibits high stability in both solution and solid state at room temperature. Experimental characterization and quantum chemical calculations reveal that the isolated diradical adopts a triplet ground state, a 90&#176;&#8208;twisted conformation with D2d symmetry, and a central C&#9472;C bond length of 1.498(5) &#197;. Preliminary studies further demonstrate the unique reactivity of this carbon&#8208;centered diradical. This strategy offers a general approach for the rational design and isolation of other highly reactive diradicals, facilitating deeper insights into their electronic structures and properties.

         <title>Benchmark C2H4/C3H6 Separation in MOF&#8211;COF Bilayer Membranes via Interfacial Coordination Induced Sub&#8208;Angstrom Channel Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial coordination induced sub&#8208;angstrom channel regulation strategy is developed where the abundant ionic groups in iCOF coordinate with ZIF&#8208;8 lattice, causing lattice contraction of ZIF&#8208;8 and shifting the molecular cut&#8208;off from 4.8 to 4.4&#160;&#197;. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;iCOF membrane exhibited record&#8208;high C2H4/C3H6 separation performance with C2H4 permeance of 405 GPU and C2H4/C3H6 selectivity of 45.








Abstract
Olefins including ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6) are pivotal raw materials in the chemical industry, and methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) process provides a sustainable strategy to replace conventional petroleum&#8208;based methods for the olefin production. The purification of olefin mixture is an essential part in the MTO process where membrane technology has emerged as a high&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving approach. However, it remains a critical challenge to achieve precise sieving of C2H4 and C3H6 due to their similar molecular size. Herein, we report an interfacial coordination induced sub&#8208;angstrom channel regulation strategy and achieve unprecedented cut&#8208;off shift of ZIF&#8208;8 from C3H6/C3H8 to C2H4/C3H6. Ionic covalent organic framework with crystalline structure and high&#8208;density sulfonate groups was used as growth template for ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. The coordination between sulfonate groups and Zn2+ ions induced lattice contraction of ZIF&#8208;8 framework, which is confirmed by XRD patterns and molecular dynamic simulations. The resulting membranes demonstrate a distinct cut&#8208;off between C2H4 and C3H6, achieving a C2H4 permeance of 405 GPU and an exceptional C2H4/C3H6 selectivity of 45, surpassing the separation performance of all reported membranes. Finally, we demonstrate the excellent scalability of this strategy by fabricating large area flat sheet membrane (&gt;500&#160;cm2) on polymer substrates.

         <title>Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation on the Low&#8208;Silica CHA Zeolite Through Cooperative Cation and Gas Molecule Migration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed K&#8208;CHA achieves excellent inverse CO2/C2H2 separation performance based on the trapdoor effect, with an ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity of 4350 and a static CO2 capacity of 3.51&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1. Structural analysis combined with computational simulations reveals the preferential affinity for CO2 of K&#8208;CHA and the distinct migration trajectories and synergistic migration of the door&#8208;keeping cations (K+ ions) and adsorbed molecules (CO2/C2H2) during gas diffusion. 








Abstract
Inverse CO2/C2H2 separation is promising for direct C2H2 purification; however, designing cost&#8208;effective and CO2&#8208;selective stable porous materials remains challenging. Herein, by precise Si/Al ratio design and inorganic cation regulation in low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites, we achieve excellent inverse CO2/C2H2 separation&#160;based on the trapdoor effect via a cooperative cation and gas molecule migration mechanism, distinct from the transient and reversible cation deviation previously reported. The designed K&#8208;CHA exhibits high CO2 capacity (3.51&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1) and much lower C2H2 uptake (0.62&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, achieving an ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity of 4350, outperforming most metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolites. Breakthrough experiments confirmed the exceptional one&#8208;step C2H2 purification ability of K&#8208;CHA, yielding a productivity of 662.9&#160;mmol&#160;kg&#8722;1. Rietveld refinement located cation positions within CHA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) elucidated the separation mechanism that CO2 interacts more strongly with K&#8208;CHA compared to C2H2, and the diffusion barrier for CO2 passing through K&#8314;&#8208;gated 8&#8208;rings is lower than C2H2. AIMD further revealed distinct trajectories and synergistic migration of the door&#8208;keeping K+ ions and CO2/C2H2&#160;molecules during diffusion. This work provides new insights into the trapdoor mechanism, advancing our fundamental understanding.

         <title>Programmed Pore Engineering in an Isoreticular Triazole&#8211;MOF Series for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Separation</title>

Programmed hydrogen&#8208;bond modulation within aminotriazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) creates supramolecular interlocks in ZSTU&#8208;30 that invert a usual adsorption order, enabling CO2&#8208;preferred removal, cascading separation C2H2, and obtaining polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from ternary gas mixtures in a single step. 








Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification from CO2/C2H2/C2H4 ternary mixtures is industrially crucial yet remains highly challenging. Current metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack the ideal CO2&#160;&gt;&#160;C2H2&#160;&gt;&#160;C2H4 adsorption sequence necessary for stepwise removal of impurities. Herein, we address this gap through precise pore environment tuning within an isoreticular series of zinc&#8211;triazole MOFs. By modulating the number and position of &#9472;NH2/&#9472;CH3 groups on the ligand, we precisely control pore chemistry from one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) interconnected channels, which successfully achieves the targeted adsorption order. The unilateral amino groups in the optimized MOF, ZSTU&#8208;30, create unique supramolecular interlocking sites that strongly bind CO2 while mitigating interactions with C2H4 and C2H2. Consequently, ZSTU&#8208;30 enables the direct production of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt; 99.9%) from a ternary gas mixture in a single step, with an exceptional C2H4 productivity of 3.18&#160;mmol g&#8722;1. The CO2&#8211;host interaction mechanism is elucidated by in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, which reveal multiple supramolecular interactions at the adsorption sites. Combining excellent water and pH stability, ZSTU&#8208;30 stands out as a robust and promising physisorbent for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Engineering of MXene&#8208;Based Metal Arrays for Oriented Generation of High&#8208;Valent Metal&#8208;Oxo Species from Peroxymonosulfate for Fast Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric oxygen&#8208;coordination strategy activates inert V2C MXene to induce PMS to generate high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species (HVMOS), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This arises from replacing conventional two&#8208;electron oxygen transfer at single sites with synergistic single&#8208;electron transfer via short&#8208;range bimetallic oxygen bridges in a topologically sympathetic electric field, thereby significantly reducing the free energy of HVMOS generation. 








Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species (HVMOS) are appealing for water purification because they break the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off of conventional radical&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes. However, oriented HVMOS generation via heterogeneous reactions has been challenging because of the difficulty in the precise design of favourable and high&#8208;loading active sites. Herein, a facile asymmetric oxygen&#8208;containing coordination strategy was developed to activate inert metal arrays in V2C MXene, which could effectively activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to selectively generate HVMOS. The unique ultrashort&#8208;range distance between neighboring V sites (2.36&#160;&#197;) in MXene with asymmetric coordination generated a distinctive topological sympathetic electric field (TSEF), which enabled efficient PMS activation and ultrafast oxidation of water pollutants (kobs&#160;=&#160;1498.33 min&#8722;1M&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies revealed a new single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer pathway from PMS to V2C through short&#8208;range bimetallic oxygen bridges, significantly reducing the energy barrier of HVMOS generation promoted by TSEF. The nonradical system exhibited robust anti&#8208;interference capacity and excellent stability in different real water matrices and long&#8208;term operations.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Catalytic Performance Tuning of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Using a Weaving Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a universal weaving strategy, researchers synthesized HE&#8208;MOFs by precisely controlling the dosage of metal&#8211;ligand complexes (MLs) and H2L. After carbonization, these HE&#8208;MOFs were converted into HEAs/CeO2/C, featuring tunable metal contents and adjustable catalytic activities. This method provides a novel approach for designing multicomponent catalysts.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered considerable interest for their exceptional properties, notably in catalysis, owing to their multiple active sites and synergistic metal interactions. High&#8208;entropy metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HE&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising precursors for the synthesis of diverse HEAs. However, conventional approaches to synthesizing HE&#8208;MOFs rely primarily on increasing metal ion diversity within the MOF nodes, often leading to complex and poorly controlled reaction kinetics. In this work, we present a novel weaving strategy that incorporates the pre&#8208;synthesis of metal&#8211;ligand complexes (MLs) as modular building blocks to overcome the intricate coordination dynamics associated with multiple metal ions and ligands. By designing a series of ML &#8220;threads&#8221; and precisely controlling their stoichiometry and combination, we successfully fabricate HE&#8208;MOFs incorporating cerium oxide clusters as structural nodes. Subsequent carbonization and reduction convert these HE&#8208;MOFs into CeO2/C&#8208;supported alloys or HEAs with finely adjustable metal contents and tunable catalytic properties. A dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system revealed that the optimized HEAs(10L)/CeO2/C catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 13.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This pioneering method permits atomic&#8208;level control over the metal composition of HEAs, ensuring a broad range of metal ions are homogeneously distributed and enabling the rational design of highly efficient catalytic systems.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Diimide Dimers with Cross Conformations as Cathode Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three perylene&#8208;diimide dimers (S&#8208;di(PDI)s) as cathode interfacial layer (CIL) were designed and synthesized, which not only preserve the large planar conjugated backbone of PDI subunits but also exhibit a cross conformation between two PDI blades. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with S&#8208;di(PDI)&#8208;NBr CIL achieved remarkable PCEs of 20.53% and 26.53%, respectively, because of the excellent charge transporting ability and good solution processability.








Abstract
A series of PDI&#8208;based monomers and cross&#8208;coupled copolymers have been reported recently, exhibiting excellent photoelectric performance as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the problems of high crystallinity for monomers and poor batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch repeatability for copolymers are still unresolved, which inspire the probe to the size of PDI&#8208;based materials. Herein, PDI&#8208;based homo&#8208;oligomers, namely single&#8208;bond&#8208;linked perylene&#8208;diimide dimers (S&#8208;di(PDI)s) were designed and synthesized. Compared with PDI monomers, S&#8208;di(PDI)s not only retain the large planar conjugated backbone of PDI subunits, but also exhibit a cross conformation between two PDI blades, which is beneficial for maintaining excellent electron transporting capability while reducing intermolecular excessive aggregation and achieving outstanding optical and thermal stabilities. Among them, the binary devices of D18:L8&#8208;BO fabricated with S&#8208;di(PDI)&#8208;NBr CIL achieve a remarkable PCE of 20.53%, even higher than devices fabricated with copolymer PNDIT&#8208;F3N that is widely used as CIL in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSC system. Meanwhile, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on S&#8208;di(PDI)&#8208;NBr CIL also achieved an outstanding PCE of 26.53%, much higher than PSCs based on C60 CIL.

Herein, PDI-based homo-oligomers, namely single-bond-linked perylene-diimide dimers (S-di(PDI)s) were designed and synthesized. Compared with PDI monomers, S-di(PDI)s not only retain the large planar conjugated backbone of PDI subunits, but also exhibit a cross conformation between two PDI blades, which is beneficial for maintaining excellent electron transporting capability while reducing intermolecular excessive aggregation and achieving outstanding optical and thermal stabilities. Among them, the binary devices of D18:L8-BO fabricated with S-di(PDI)-NBr CIL achieve a remarkable PCE of 20.53%, even higher than devices fabricated with copolymer PNDIT-F3N that is widely used as CIL in state-of-the-art OSC system. Meanwhile, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on S-di(PDI)-NBr CIL also achieved an outstanding PCE of 26.53%, much higher than PSCs based on C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; CIL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Reaction Intermediates in Oxide&#8208;Derived Hollow Cu&#8211;Zn Bimetallic Catalyst Facilitates Selective Formation of C2+ Alcohols from Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinement strategy has been shown to enhance the C2+ alcohol selectivity and overall C2+ product in hollow Cu&#8211;Zn bimetallic catalyst. The hollow catalyst confines the reaction intermediate by slowing down their outflow and hence enhances the retention time of the intermediates. This leads to an increased surface coverage of CO that favors the C&#9472;C coupling that enhances the C2+ product formation. 








Abstract
Copper has long been the only element known to produce multicarbon (C2+) products from CO2 through electrochemical pathways. However, its low kinetic barrier favors ethylene formation over C2&#8314; alcohols at the selectivity&#8208;determining step (SDS). Alloying Cu with secondary metals has been explored to shift selectivity toward alcohols, but these approaches often suffer from poor activity and selectivity. In this work, we probe the role of confinement of reaction intermediates in favoring C2+ alcohol selectivity and overall C2+ product in oxide&#8208;derived hollow Cu&#8211;Zn bimetallic catalysts. From finite element method (FEM) simulation, it was observed that hollow catalyst increases the retention time of the reaction intermediates that favor the C&#9472;C coupling. Confinement gives rise to a two&#8208;fold increment in the overall C2+ product. We observed that the hollow Cu&#8211;Zn catalyst gives a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 50.13% toward C2+ alcohol and an overall FE of 81% toward C2+ product at a very high current density of 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KHCO3. DFT calculation shows that Zn affects selectivity determining step (SDS) and favors the formation of alcohol over ethylene. Various in situ techniques, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, were used to understand the active phase of the catalyst and mechanism in detail.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence with Large Dissymmetry Factor over 10&#8722;1 Based on Flexible Point&#8208;Chirality via Programming at Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small spirocyclic chiral fluorophores (SCFs) with donor&#8211;acceptor hydrogen bonds enable point chirality transfer to induce intrinsic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), driven by significant steric effects. Luminescence intensity and color in SCFs can be tuned by modulating hydrogen bonding through solvent choice. Moreover, the highly twisted SCF framework promotes &#945;&#8208;Helix&#8208;like stacking in a programmable manner, yielding opposite CPL signals and enhancing the dissymmetry factor (glum) to 0.18.








Abstract
In this work, we report a series of small Spirocyclic Chiral Fluorophores (SCFs) with donor&#8208;acceptor type small&#8208;&#960; emitters. These SCFs induce mimic &#945;&#8208;helix supramolecular packing modes via adjustments at the molecular level (e.g., hydrogen bonding sites, positions of fused rings). This approach not only enhances circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) up to 0.18 in assembled materials but also enables inversion of the chiral signal. Moreover, unlike most CPL materials with a single point&#8208;chiral center that are CPL&#8208;silent at the molecular state, the spirocyclic configuration can enhance efficient point&#8208;chirality transfer to the fluorophores owing to the self&#8208;rigidified skeleton, consequently enable efficient CPL with the glum in the order of 10&#8722;3 even in the molecular solutions. The mechanistic insights are revealed by experimental investigation including the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal analysis, as well as DFT calculation. This study opens new avenues for developing organic CPL materials with large g values based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight flexible point&#8208;chiral fluorophores, offering great potential for future applications in biotechnology and circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs).

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Geometry Engineering for High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Low Coercive Field in Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing molecular symmetry and geometry engineering, trigonal pyramidal cations with C3v symmetry adopted in ferroelectric hybrid metal halides undergo partial disorder transition to enable the highest Curie temperature up to decomposition temperature (530&#160;K) and exceptionally low coercive field (0.25&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K).








Abstract
Optimizing ferroelectric properties is critical for molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics toward practical applications, including enhanced saturation polarization (Ps), elevated Curie temperature (TC), and reduced coercive field (Ec). Recent advances in ferroelectrochemistry have provided efficient synthetic strategies to tailor these properties, with a focus on functionalizing organic components. However, the impact of combined molecular symmetry and geometry on ferroelectricity remains less understood. In this work, we construct a series of one&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric hybrid metal halides (HMHs) using C3v&#8208;symmetric trigonal pyramidal polar cations to systematically investigate how molecular symmetry and geometry modulate ferroelectric behavior. The model compound (TMS)PbI3 (TMS&#160;=&#160;trimethylsulfonium) exhibits ferroelectricity up to its decomposition temperature (530&#160;K), the highest among known HMH ferroelectrics, alongside an exceptionally low Ec (0.25&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K). We demonstrate that the unique C3v symmetry and trigonal pyramidal geometry of the TMS cation facilitate energy&#8208;favorable uniaxial rotation about the polar 3&#8208;fold axis and 90&#176; polarity flipping during disordering in the ferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase transition near 271&#160;K. This partial disorder transition underpins the remarkable high&#8208;temperature ferroelectric phase and low Ec. Selenium&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;based analogs show similar properties with Ec values of 0.55 and 0.47&#160;kV cm&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis Driving Auto&#8208;Catalytic Process Toward Oxidant&#8208;Free Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry for Water Purification</title>

A Fe/Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DSAC) featuring adjacent Fe and Co atoms each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate enables synergistic electron extraction from pollutants, facilitating rapid pollutant degradation through an auto&#8208;catalytic pathway.








Abstract
Driving oxidant&#8208;free catalysis toward green and efficient Fenton&#8208;like chemistry for water purification has been developed as a research hotspots of priority concern. In this study, a Fe/Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DSAC) was synthesized with adjacent Fe and Co atoms coordinating with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate, and applied in an oxidant&#8208;free system for pollutant degradation via an auto&#8208;catalytic pathway. Results showed dissolved oxygen (DO) was not the primary electron acceptor. In contrast, pollutants were adsorbed on electron&#8208;deficient sites, with electrons transferred to electron&#8208;rich dual Fe/Co sites via the carbon network, evidenced by a 0.6 oxidation state decrease and reduced open circuit potential. Intermediate analysis also confirmed the degradation process beyond adsorption process.

&lt;p&gt;A Fe/Co dual single-atom catalyst (FeCo-DSAC) featuring adjacent Fe and Co atoms each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate enables synergistic electron extraction from pollutants, facilitating rapid pollutant degradation through an auto-catalytic pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving oxidant-free catalysis toward green and efficient Fenton-like chemistry for water purification has been developed as a research hotspots of priority concern. In this study, a Fe/Co dual single-atom catalyst (FeCo-DSAC) was synthesized with adjacent Fe and Co atoms coordinating with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate, and applied in an oxidant-free system for pollutant degradation via an auto-catalytic pathway. Results showed dissolved oxygen (DO) was not the primary electron acceptor. In contrast, pollutants were adsorbed on electron-deficient sites, with electrons transferred to electron-rich dual Fe/Co sites via the carbon network, evidenced by a 0.6 oxidation state decrease and reduced open circuit potential. Intermediate analysis also confirmed the degradation process beyond adsorption process. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Fe doping not only introduced the additional active sites but also modulated the electronic structure of Co, making it more favorable for accepting the electrons from pollutants. This synergistic interaction facilitated effective contaminant degradation within the oxidant-free system. Furthermore, lifecycle analysis showed better environmental performance than conventional oxidant-added systems. This study provides new insights into the oxidant-free Fenton-like chemistry and advances the low-energy and low-chemical consumption water treatment technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating P States of Organophosphine Polymers to Enhance Multi&#8208;Channel Synergetic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>

Organophosphine polymers with different P states are prepared to explore the influence of intrinsic n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* states for RTP properties. Compared with n&#960;*&#8211;&#960;&#960;* competitive PAM&#8208;TPPO and n&#960;*&#8208;excluded PAM&#8208;TPP+, PAM&#8208;TPP exhibits n&#960;*&#8211;&#960;&#960;* synergy, which can not only promote ISC and Tn* population but also inhibit the influence of excitation wavelength on the RTP performance, thereby achieving the best RTP performance.








Abstract
According to El&#8208;Sayed's rule, n&#960;* component would facilitate intersystem crossing (ISC) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of organic molecules. However, purposeful molecular design still faces big challenge due to insufficient understanding of inherent effect of n&#960;* states on RTP. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;containing groups of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide, and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are introduced in polyacrylamide matrix, corresponding to PAM&#8208;TPP, PAM&#8208;TPPO, and PAM&#8208;TPP+. It shows that phosphorus (&#8220;P&#8221;) states determine excited&#8208;state compositions of these polymers and, more importantly, result in different RTP processes. p&#8211;&#960; conjugation between P atom and phenyls in PAM&#8208;TPP integrates ISC acceleration and triplet convergence to stabilize triplet states (Tn*). In contrast, P&#160;=&#160;O localized n&#960;* state of PAM&#8208;TPPO competes with &#960;&#960;* states of phenyls, while PAM&#8208;TPP+ has pure &#960;&#960;* states. In contrast to RTP&#8208;free PAM&#8208;TPPO and PAM&#8208;TPP+, with RTP dependent on 1&#960;&#960;* excitation, PAM&#8208;TPP achieves the best RTP performance, including the longest lifetime beyond 250&#160;ms, the highest efficiency reaching 10.8%, and the limited excitation dependence, owing to its more than fourfold larger ISC rate constants reaching 10&#8722;7 s&#8722;1 and doubled RTP proportions. This work clarifies the importance of n&#960;*&#8211;&#960;&#960;* synergy for developing high&#8208;performance RTP materials.

         <title>Seawater Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;level Current Densities Enabled by Pentagonal Defect&#8208;Rich Nanocarbon with Chlorine Doping</title>

Pentagonal defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon with chlorine&#8208;doping enables efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in seawater at industrial current densities, demonstrating great potential in pollutant degradation and marine disinfection.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) in seawater shows great prospects. However, designing an electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity, resistance to seawater corrosion, and even stable operation at industrial currents (&#8805;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), remains a critical challenge. In this work, we report a pentagonal defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon with chlorine&#8208;doping (Cl&#8208;PDC) by tailoring fullerene (C60) precursors via the molten salt method. The as&#8208;prepared Cl&#8208;PDC catalyst achieves a record H2O2 yield of 74.61&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a current density of 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency, outperforming among all previously reported catalysts in simulated seawater or neutral environments. Remarkably, the Cl&#8208;PDC&#8208;based electrode maintains operational stability over 400 h in simulated seawater, and enables rapid disinfection and pollutant degradation. Theoretical calculations and experimental analysis reveal that the synergy between the intrinsic pentagonal defects and Cl doping modulates the electronic structure of the carbon framework, optimizing *OOH intermediate adsorption, and introduces the localized negative charge to suppress Cl&#8722; poisoning at active sites. This work paves the way for sustainable seawater H2O2 production and marine environmental protection.

         <title>Physically Masked Nanoflares for Accurate Biological Applications by Blocking Nucleases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a porous nanocage constructed by polymer was used to trap the nanoflare for bio&#8208;application for the first time. Different from the traditional nanoflare, bulky nuclease was inhibited to traverse the nanocage but not for flexible nucleic acid target. Thus, high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence signal was acquired, and cancer cells can be differentiated from normal cells by fully avoiding the interference from nuclease.








Abstract
Nanoflare integrated with a gold nanoparticle (Au NP) core and a functional oligonucleotide shell is a powerful platform for bio&#8208;applications, such as sensing, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. However, degradation of nucleic acids by endogenous nucleases in vivo is an inevitable problem causing signal distortion. To solve this issue, in this work, a physically masked strategy was designed by trapping the nanoflare in a porous polymer nanocage. The porous structure of the nanocage allowed the penetration of small target molecules to react with the internal nanoflare, while bulky nucleases were blocked, resulting in high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence signaling. Using this method, cancer cells were differentiated from normal cells by a masked nanoflare that can recognize a microRNA biomarker (miRNA&#8208;21), and tumors were imaged with a high&#8208;contrast signal. The physical masking strategy opened up a new path for improving the stability of nucleic acid probes against nucleases, facilitating accurate bio&#8208;application.

         <title>Autocatalytic Circular DNA Powered Plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a Platform for Ultrasensitive Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Target Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autocatalytic circular DNA (cir&#8208;DNA) enhanced plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a platform that leverages spatial confinement effects for ultrasensitive detection of non&#8208;nucleic acid targets was engineered.








Abstract
CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based detection of non&#8208;nucleic acid targets faces two major challenges: 1) limited sensitivity due to the inherent inability to pre&#8208;amplify non&#8208;nucleic acid targets, and 2) suboptimal performance of traditional reporters caused by photobleaching of fluorescent dyes, rapid degradation, and slow reaction kinetics resulting from random molecular collisions. To overcome these limitations, we developed an innovative plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a platform featuring positive&#8208;feedback autocatalytic circular DNA (cir&#8208;DNA) amplification. This system synergistically combines spatial confinement effects with plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (PEF) to achieve ultrasensitive detection of non&#8208;nucleic acid targets. The engineered cir&#8208;DNA enables continuous Cas12a regeneration for autocatalytic signal amplification, while the designed plasmonic spherical nucleic acids significantly accelerate reaction kinetics while enhancing fluorescence signals. This integrated approach reduced the required reaction time to 15&#160;min while improving the detection limit by approximately 52&#8208;fold compared to conventional methods.

     alt="Autocatalytic Circular DNA Powered Plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a Platform for Ultrasensitive Non-Nucleic Acid Target Sensing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An autocatalytic circular DNA (cir-DNA) enhanced plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a platform that leverages spatial confinement effects for ultrasensitive detection of non-nucleic acid targets was engineered.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR/Cas12a-based detection of non-nucleic acid targets faces two major challenges: 1) limited sensitivity due to the inherent inability to pre-amplify non-nucleic acid targets, and 2) suboptimal performance of traditional reporters caused by photobleaching of fluorescent dyes, rapid degradation, and slow reaction kinetics resulting from random molecular collisions. To overcome these limitations, we developed an innovative plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a platform featuring positive-feedback autocatalytic circular DNA (cir-DNA) amplification. This system synergistically combines spatial confinement effects with plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) to achieve ultrasensitive detection of non-nucleic acid targets. The engineered cir-DNA enables continuous Cas12a regeneration for autocatalytic signal amplification, while the designed plasmonic spherical nucleic acids significantly accelerate reaction kinetics while enhancing fluorescence signals. This integrated approach reduced the required reaction time to 15&#160;min while improving the detection limit by approximately 52-fold compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning model, not only the assessment of the risk level of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) based on threshold-positive and threshold-negative serum concentrations but also highly accurate blind testing were both achieved, highlighting its potential for clinical applications such as pregnancy risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Hydrogen Participation and Mass Transport Acceleration Improve CO2 Electroreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced selectivity for C2 products achieved under broad&#8208;range high current densities via lattice hydrogen from Ho&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;stabilized CuH nanosheets participating in CO2RR.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction operated at high current densities typically face the critical issues of CO2 depletion and competing reactions. Here we prepared CuH branched nanosheets stabilized with holmium single atoms (HoSA&#8208;CuH). Finite&#8208;element analyses show that the branched HoSA&#8208;CuH structure could accelerate mass transport and alleviate CO2 depletion under high current densities. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Ho single atoms increase the electron density at Cu surface, which is conducive to CO2 enrichment and activation. Deuterium isotope labeling experiments confirm that the lattice hydrogen in CuH participate in the reaction, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step in C&#8211;C coupling. Therefore, the selectivity for C2+ over HoSA&#8208;CuH is above 80% under 700&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and C2 products account for 95% of all the C2+ products. Compared with the best&#8208;performing catalysts reported thus far, HoSA&#8208;CuH displays the broadest current density range for high FEC2.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Asymmetrical Charge Distribution on Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Sn Sites in Sn&#8208;Doped Bi2MoO6 for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>

Sn doping into Bi2MoO6 introduces enhanced Ov and constructs charge&#8208;asymmetrical Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Sn sites for boosting proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and charge separation. This multisite catalyst exhibits excellent CO2 photoreduction activity in pure water, with an enhanced CH4 evolution rate of 207.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and unprecedented AQE of 9.4% at 420 nm.








Abstract
Efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) at tailored active sites is beneficial for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, yet the relationship between catalytic sites and performance remains unclear. Herein, p&#8208;block Sn is introduced into the Bi2MoO6 lattice (Sn&#8208;BMO) via Bi site substitution to construct a novel oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Sn structure, where high&#8208;valence Sn induces Ov formation by lowering the Bi valence state, thereby creating a charge&#8208;asymmetrical region. This unique configuration promotes PCET: Sn acts as H2O oxidation site, enabling proton transfer to proximal Bi site connected to Ov that preferentially traps electrons to convert CO2. Furthermore, the electronic structure of Bi is modified to optimize Bi 6p&#8208;C 2p hybridization for formation of the key intermediate *CHO with low energy barrier. Consequently, Sn&#8208;BMO exhibits a remarkable CH4 evolution rate of 207.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 95.7% CH4 selectivity in pure water, achieving a record apparent quantum efficiency of 9.4% at 420&#160;nm. This work provides a novel approach to design charge&#8208;asymmetrical active site in multisite catalysts, elucidating how p&#8208;block elements influence catalytic performance in CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Zn(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions: Access to Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfonimidate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral Lewis acid catalyzed asymmetric nucleophilic substitution of sulfonimidoyl chlorides was reported, using 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines as nucleophiles, generating sulfur(VI)&#8208;stereogenic chiral sulfonimidate esters with good yields, excellent chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. A one&#8208;pot procedure enhanced the practicality. Quinuclidine as an additive facilitated a transformation from kinetic resolution to a dynamic kinetic process. DFT calculations and mechanistic experiments exhibit a bifunctional activation mode. The reaction is featured with kinetic resolution characteristics via an SN2 pathway.








Abstract
The construction of stereogenic S(VI) centers remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis, despite incremental advances. The enantioselective transformation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides is rarely described for forming chiral S(VI)&#9472;O bonds and limited to covalent organocatalytic manners. Herein, we report the first chiral Lewis acid catalyzed asymmetric nucleophilic substitution of sulfonimidoyl chlorides, using 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines as nucleophiles, affording sulfur(VI)&#8208;stereogenic chiral sulfonimidate esters with good yields (up to 94% yield), excellent chemoselectivities (O&#8208;functionalization) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Enantioenriched sulfonimidate esters are stereospecifically transformed into chiral S(VI) derivatives, with the 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine unit acting as the leaving group. The practicality of this method is enhanced via a directed one&#8208;pot procedure of in situ&#8208;generated sulfonimidoyl chloride from S(IV) sulfonamide. Furthermore, the addition of quinuclidine as an additive can trigger rapid racemization of sulfonimidoyl chloride, establishing a dynamic kinetic process instead of a kinetic resolution. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via an SN2 pathway with kinetic resolution characteristics. A bifunctional activation mode is elucidated by mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, in which Zn(II)&#8208;ligand complex activates the sulfonimidoyl chloride, while imidazolidine N&#8211;H forms a H&#8208;bond with the nitrogen atom in 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines.

         <title>Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Spiroaminoalkylation: One&#8208;Step Construction of Multifunctional Angular Polycyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric spiroaminoalkylation/allylic substitution reaction from easily available amine&#8208;tethered cyclohexa&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and salicylaldehydes or ortho&#8208;amino aromatic aldehydes has been developed, which allows for the expedient construction of chiral angular polycyclic amines.








Abstract
Angular polycycles are ubiquitous in natural products with significant biological properties. However, the straightforward catalytic asymmetric synthesis of spirocyclic scaffolds with multiple stereogenic centers from readily available starting materials remains largely underdeveloped and a formidable challenge. Using the aminoalkyl cyclopalladated complex as the key intermediate, we report herein the first example of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective multifunctional angular tetracyclic&#8208; and pentacyclic amines synthesis through palladium&#8208;catalyzed spiroaminoalkylation/allylic substitution reaction (up to 92% yield, up to 99% ee). The synthetic versatility of this methodology is underscored by the efficient synthesis of chiral phosphine ligands, which further demonstrates its robust utility in concisely constructing versatile chiral ligands.

Using the aminoalkyl cyclopalladated complex as the key intermediate, we report herein the first example of diastereo- and enantioselective multifunctional angular tetracyclic- and pentacyclic amines synthesis through palladium-catalyzed spiroaminoalkylation/allylic substitution reaction (up to 92% yield, up to 99% ee). The synthetic versatility of this methodology is underscored by the efficient synthesis of chiral phosphine ligands, which further demonstrates its robust utility in concisely constructing versatile chiral ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indole&#8208;Linkages as Base&#8208;Activated Sites in a Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Under Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of a nitro&#8208;containing sp2&#8208;carbon covalent organic framework (COF) (CityU&#8208;44) through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg reaction provided an indole&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;45), which displayed base&#8208;triggered active sites and a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at pH&#160;=&#160;13, six times higher than that under neutral conditions.








Abstract
The photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under alkaline conditions is very important for biomass pretreatment and electronic industry. However, the proton&#8208;deficient nature of alkaline water and the intolerance of COF linkages in strong alkaline conditions lead to insufficient H2O2 production by most COF&#8208;based catalysts. Thus, developing novel COFs containing base&#8208;triggered active sites is an effective strategy to maintain structural rigidity and photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, an indole&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;45) was prepared through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg post&#8208;synthetic reaction in a nitro&#8208;containing sp2&#8208;carbon COF (CityU&#8208;44). The formation of the indole linkage maintains its crystallinity, reduces the bandgap, and results in the redshift of fluorescent emission. Moreover, CityU&#8208;45 reveals an alkaline&#8208;activated characteristic with a photocatalytic H2O2 rate up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at pH&#160;=&#160;13, which is six times higher than that in neutral conditions. This research demonstrated that indole&#8208;linked COFs can be promising catalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 generation under alkaline conditions.

         <title>Hyalucidin A: A Bacterial RiPP Featuring a Benzofuranoindoline Motif Biosynthesized by Tandem P450 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyalucidin A, the most complex polycyclic bacterial RiPP identified to date, features a unique benzofuranoindoline motif and was discovered by targeting dual&#8208;P450 gene clusters. The synergistic P450 catalysis that drives its formation was elucidated, and peptide engineering led to the creation of 22 derivatives, emonstrating a scalable platform for macrocyclic RiPP diversification.








Abstract
Despite the emergence of P450&#8208;modified ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) as a distinct and rapidly expanding class of natural products, their structural diversity has been limited to scaffolds catalyzed solely by single P450 enzymes. To access greater structural complexity, we targeted unexplored biosynthetic gene clusters encoding two P450s. This effort led to the discovery of hyalucidin A, which features the most intricate polycyclic cross&#8208;linked architecture among reported P450&#8208;RiPPs and represents the first bacterial RiPP containing a benzofuranoindoline motif. Through stepwise enzymatic analysis, combinatorial biosynthesis, and precursor peptide engineering, we deciphered the cooperative function and substrate tolerance of both P450s. Our work expands the biosynthetic logic of P450&#8208;driven cyclization and provides a platform for engineering complex macrocyclic peptides.

         <title>Deactivation of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high activity and selectivity. However, they are dynamic and can be deactivated by the aggregation of metal atoms into nanoparticles (NPs). We argue that NP formation is one of the primary deactivation pathway, where NPs &#8220;poison&#8221; the SAC by capturing active atoms. Using experimental data, we conceptualize SACs and NPs as a dynamic system and propose strategies for suppressing aggregation, making it a key criterion for the development of stable catalysts.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent a pinnacle of atomic efficiency and catalytic precision. Their remarkable activity and selectivity arise from isolated, low&#8208;coordinate metal centers that engage directly in bond&#8208;forming events. However, under realistic reaction conditions, SACs are far from static. Increasing evidence reveals that single atoms undergo dynamic evolution over the reaction time. In this perspective, we challenge the conventional dichotomy that views SACs and nanoparticles (NPs) as fundamentally distinct catalytic systems. We propose that NPs, rather than acting as parallel or cooperative catalysts, may function as catalytic poisonants for SACs by trapping active metal atoms. This transformation results in loss of activity, reduced selectivity, and degradation of the catalytic system. Drawing on mechanistic studies, thermodynamic data, and experimental observations across diverse reaction classes, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and cross&#8208;coupling, we show that the aggregation of SACs into NPs is not merely a side process but rather a limitation to their stability and utility. We further outline thermodynamic and kinetic strategies to suppress this deactivation pathway and propose design principles that elevate NP suppression from a synthetic challenge to a foundational criterion in catalyst development. This perspective reframes the SAC&#8211;NP relationship as a dynamic continuum and emphasizes the importance of stabilizing isolated active sites in next&#8208;generation catalytic technologies.

         <title>Programmable Nanoscale Motion via Molecular Patterning on DNA Origami</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami nanorods enable precise urease placement with tunable coverage and asymmetry, revealing that propulsion depends on a balance of catalytic loading and geometry. Maximum speed occurs at &#8764;25% end&#8208;coverage and declines as enzyme distribution becomes more symmetrical. Experiments and simulations establish a framework for rational nanomotor design using programmable enzyme patterning.








Abstract
Asymmetry in enzymatically driven nanomotor design, both structural and functional, is widely considered essential for propulsion. However, the interplay between particle geometry, enzyme distribution, and catalytic loading remains poorly defined, largely due to limited control over enzyme positioning that hinders quantitative analysis. Using DNA origami nanorods, we achieve precise spatial placement of urease enzymes with independently tunable coverage and asymmetry. Single&#8208;particle tracking reveals that motility arises not solely from enzyme number or spatial arrangement but from a balance between catalytic loading and geometric anisotropy. Unexpectedly, maximal propulsion occurs at &#8764;25% urease end&#8208;coverage, significantly below the conventional 50% end&#8208;coverage, where half of the available binding positions on one structural half of the origami are occupied. Boundary Element Method simulations incorporating identical spatial parameters reproduce these findings, confirming that programmable enzyme patterning dictates diffusiophoretic propulsion. These results provide a quantitative framework linking topology, catalytic activity, and motion, revealing that optimal motility does not coincide with maximal asymmetry and advancing the rational design of enzyme&#8208;powered DNA nanomotors.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Support&#8208;Induced Interfacial Effects Steer Methanol Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction by Immobilized Cobalt Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) converts CO2 to methanol when immobilized on carbon nanotubes. Multiscale simulations show how nanotube supports shield CoPc from water, lowering the protonation barrier for adsorbed CO without affecting desorption. This enables methanol formation and highlights support engineering as crucial for tuning electrocatalytic pathways in heterogenized molecular catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanol when immobilized on carbon nanotubes. Multiscale simulations show how nanotube supports shield CoPc from water, lowering the protonation barrier for adsorbed CO without affecting desorption. This enables methanol formation and highlights support engineering as crucial for tuning electrocatalytic pathways in heterogenized molecular catalysts.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Type Polarization&#8208;Triggered Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation in Conjugated Polymers for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Evolution in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;polarization strategy is developed to achieve spontaneous exciton dissociation while lowering Eb by introducing B&#8592;N bonds and triazine as the dual&#8208;polarization units, achieving a superhigh AQY of 25.84% at 420&#160;nm and SCC up to 1.20% in pure water for H2O2 evolution.








Abstract
Severe exciton effect significantly hinders free&#8208;charge&#8208;involved water redox reactions, limiting the improvement of photocatalytic performance. Herein, a dual polarization strategy was proposed to achieve spontaneous exciton dissociation while lowering exciton binding energy by introducing B&#8592;N bonds and triazine as the dual&#8208;type polarization unit into the alkynyl&#8208;linked conjugated backbone. Dual&#8208;type polarization centers can induce spontaneous exciton dissociation (exciton activation energy &lt;25 meV) to generate more free charges that participate in water oxidation reactions. Triazine as the second polarization unit, lowers the energy barrier of the H2O oxidation reaction and serves as the active site of the O2 reduction reaction to accelerate H2O2&#8208;evolution. The H2O2&#8208;evolution performance of the dual&#8208;polarization photocatalyst reaches up to 4261&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a superb apparent quantum yield of 25.84% at 420&#160;nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion up to 1.20% in pure water, surpassing most of the H2O2&#8208;evolution organic photocatalysts ever reported. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;polarization photocatalyst exhibits strong universality in complex water bodies (lake water, river water, and seawater), while achieving higher H2O2&#8208;evolution performance than that in pure water.

         <title>Synergistic Co&#8208;Doping of Barium and Cobalt Enables Stable and Active RuO2 for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high activity and long&#8208;term durability with non&#8208;iridium catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a challenge. This work presents a co&#8208;doping strategy that incorporates Ba and Co into home&#8208;made RuO2, which introduces lattice strain and favorable electronic structure regulation, thereby enhancing both activity and stability for acidic OER and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. 








Abstract
Developing acid&#8208;stable and active non&#8208;iridium oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial to facilitating the cost&#8208;effective and large&#8208;scale applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) for hydrogen production. However, the instability of Ru sites and lattice oxygen loss limit their further application, imposing a significant challenge to designing Ru&#8208;based catalysts with both high activity and long&#8208;term stability. Here, cobalt and barium co&#8208;doped RuO2 catalysts (Ba/Co&#8208;RuO2) are developed, exhibiting a low overpotential of 166&#160;mV and exceptional durability, maintaining OER operation for over 1500 h at 10 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4 with negligible decay. More importantly, a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer using Ba/Co&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also demonstrates excellent performance, achieving 3 A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.87&#160;V and sustaining durability for over 300 h at 800 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ and ex situ experimental characterizations, together with computational analyses, confirm that the remarkable activity and stability originate from Ba and Co co&#8208;doping, which induces lattice strain and electron redistribution. These effects effectively stabilize the catalyst's structure and synergistically regulate the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. This work provides an efficient co&#8208;doping strategy to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for PEMWE.

         <title>Access to Axially Chiral Vinyl Sulfilimines via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Radical Relay Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Sulfilimination of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component trifluoromethylsulfilimination of alkynes has been realized via precise formation and manipulations of alkenyl radicals. The coupling systems proceeded in high regioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, affording S(IV)&#8208;based chirality as well as axial chirality (olefin).








Abstract
Sulfilimines have garnered increasing attention as valuable scaffolds in drug discovery and asymmetric synthesis. Nevertheless, catalytic enantioselective construction of sulfilimines in both axial and point chirality chemical space remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective sulfilimination of terminal alkynes with sulfenamides via a radical relay mechanism, enabling the direct assembly of axially chiral vinyl sulfilimines with high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The success of this strategy hinges on the atroposelective trapping of transient high active vinyl radicals by a chiral Cu&#8211;sulfinimidoyl intermediate. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a novel asymmetric radical sulfilimination mechanism through an enantioselective reductive elimination of a Cu(III) intermediate, thereby establishing a mechanism distinct from outer&#8208;sphere HAT&#8208;initiated radical&#8211;radical coupling or SH2 pathway.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption behavior controlled by both adsorption intensity and intermolecular interaction descriptors is unveiled with the molecular dimensionality regulation for additives. 1D&#8208; oligomer oligochitosan is selected for high adsorption intensity and low adsorption disorder, enabling concurrently the longevity and efficiency, unravelling an entirely &#8220;molecular structure&#8208;adsorption behavior&#8208;electrochemical progress&#8221; structure&#8208;function relationship. 








Abstract
Interfacial dendrite growth and parasitic reactions pose major challenges to the stability and efficiency of zinc metal batteries, prompting the exploration of electrolyte additives for interface stabilization. Here, we reveal that the interfacial adsorption of organic additives cannot be captured by the simplified Langmuir model, but is concurrently governed by vertical anodic affinity and intermolecular constraints. Building on this insight, we propose a dual&#8208;descriptor design strategy and introduce the tailored oligomers as brand&#8208;new type of electrolyte additives, aiming to balance the adsorption intensity and interfacial order at interface, thereby preventing steric agglomeration. The representative oligochitosan (OCS) synergistically optimizes the consecutive desolvation&#8208;diffusion process, facilitating vertically stacking of larger zinc grains and inhibiting hydrogen evolution, demonstrates exceptional high Coulombic efficiency (over 99.5% for Zn||Cu cells) and ultralong stability (&gt;4,400&#160;h at 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and &gt;880&#160;h at 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly outperforming conventional analogues. Moreover, Zn||V6O13 full cells retain 130.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 5,000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and 0.2&#160;Ah pouch cells maintain 91% capacity over 100 cycles. This work establishes a universal framework that connects molecular architecture with adsorption modes and interfacial dynamics, providing new insights for advanced electrolyte additives design.

         <title>Strategic Oxygen&#8208;Substitution in Perfluorinated Ce(IV) Coordination Frameworks Triggers Dual&#8208;Wavelength Nonlinear Optical Materials With Exceptional Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a partial oxygenation strategy to design rare&#8208;earth oxyfluoride crystals ACe3OF11 (A&#160;=&#160;NH4, K, Rb) with strongly enhanced nonlinear optical performances, including wide bandgaps, large SHG responses, and broad phase&#8208;matching ranges from ultraviolet to infrared regions.








Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) are crucial in laser technology for extending spectral ranges. However, achieving large SHG coefficients, suitable birefringence for phase&#8208;matching, and a broad laser output range remains a significant challenge. This work put forward a facile route to create NLO crystals with a wide&#8208;wavelength range by a slight oxygenation strategy in Ce(IV)&#8208;based fluorides. Given the tendency of perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based polyhedral geometry unit, a divalent oxygen anion was introduced to partially replace the monovalent fluorine anion to enhance the distortion of Ce(IV)&#8208;based polyhedra. This work successfully synthesized a series of acentric Ce(IV)&#8208;based oxyfluorides, ACe3OF11 (A&#160;=&#160;NH4, K, Rb), starting from noncentrosymmetric NH4Ce3F13 as the parent structure. ACe3OF11 exhibits strong SHG responses of 3.4&#8764;5.2 times that of KH2PO4 at 1064&#160;nm and 0.14&#8764;0.62 times of AgGaS2 at 2100&#160;nm, a wide phase&#8208;matching range from ultraviolet to infrared wavelength regions, which are unprecedented for rare&#8208;earth oxyfluoride crystals. This work establishes a partial oxygenation strategy for designing NLO rare&#8208;earth oxyfluorides, delivering novel NLO candidates with an optimized balance between wide bandgap, strong SHG efficiency, and unprecedented broadband phase&#8208;matching capability.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8211;Functionalized Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Exceptional Chemical Stability for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly crystalline chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;functionalized three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were designed and synthesized, featuring a 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated qtz topology and exceptional chemical stability. Notably, these COFs exhibit excellent catalytic activity, enantioselectivity, and recyclability in asymmetric N, N&#8208;acetalization reaction, markedly surpassing their homogeneous counterparts.








Abstract
The design of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) incorporating chiral phosphoric acids represents a promising strategy to enhance enantioselectivity in asymmetric catalysis while providing good framework stability, but their development remains a significant challenge. Herein, by using the multivariate approach, we report the construction of two highly crystalline chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;functionalized 3D COFs with the 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated qtz topology. Notably, the resulting frameworks exhibit exceptional chemical stability, remaining crystallinity even in 12&#160;M HCl, saturated NaOH, and boiling water. Moreover, benefiting from the confined chiral porous architecture, these COFs deliver good activity, enantioselectivity, and recyclability in asymmetric N, N&#8208;acetalization reactions, significantly outperforming their homogeneous analogues. This work not only reports a highly stable chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;functionalized 3D COF for asymmetric catalysis, but also provides a foundation for constructing robust, reusable heterogeneous chiral organocatalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site Pd Coupling with Jahn&#8211;Teller Active Cu as Pair Sites for Simultaneous Activation of Alkyne and Hydrogen Toward Efficient Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work overcomes the activity limitations of conventional single&#8208;site pairs in alkyne semihydrogenation. A single&#8208;site pair coupling Pd with Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;active Cu is engineered. The synergistic &#960;&#8211;d interaction and electronic coupling enable cooperative C2H2 activation and sequential hydrogenation. The catalyst achieves &gt;99.99% conversion and 97% selectivity with long&#8208;term stability, offering a Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;assisted orbital engineering strategy for catalyst design.








Abstract
Single&#8208;site pairs are promising in achieving high selectivity and activity in alkyne semihydrogenation, but its applicability is limited by the insufficient activity because pair sites cannot adsorb and activate alkyne. Here, we couple single&#8208;site Pd with Jahn&#8211;Teller active Cu atoms of Cu&#8208;doped Fe2O3 to construct a highly active and stable single&#8208;site Pd&#8208;Cu pairs. The Jahn&#8211;Teller active Cu possesses elongated axial orbitals, and the strong electronic coupling between Pd and Cu further contributes to their unoccupied axial d orbitals, which helps Pd&#8208;Cu pair to cooperatively activate C2H2 molecule, unlike ordinary single&#8208;site pairs where only H2 is activated. As a result, this catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, with&#160;&gt;&#160;99.99% conversion and 95.5% selectivity as well as excellent stability with negligible performance decay after 300&#8208;h test in purifying acetylene of ethylene stream. Both in situ spectra and theoretical results indicate two H addition steps occur on Pd and Cu sites in sequence. This work opens an avenue for constructing highly efficient single&#8208;site pairs for selective hydrogenation and beyond.

         <title>Mitigating Concentration Polarization via Ion&#8208;Sieving Interlayer Towards Long&#8208;Life 510&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
An interfacial ion&#8208;sieving strategy for Li metal anode is reported by introducing a poly(2&#8208;acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride&#8208;co&#8208;polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether methacrylate) (PAP) interlayer. The quaternary ammonium units of PAP effectively anchor anions and suppress their migration, while polyether chains facilitate homogeneous lithium&#8208;ion transport and diffusion. This synergistic effect increases the lithium&#8208;ion transference number and mitigates interfacial concentration polarization. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries were achieved under realistic conditions.








Abstract
Uncontrolled transport of lithium&#8208;ion and anion induce concentration polarization and Li dendrite growth, severely hindering the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries, especially under high current densities (&#8805;3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Herein, we report an interfacial ion&#8208;sieving strategy to immobilize anions and guide uniform lithium&#8208;ion transport for stable Li&#8208;metal batteries by introducing a poly(2&#8208;acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride&#8208;co&#8208;polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether methacrylate) (PAP) interlayer on Li metal anode. The quaternary ammonium groups effectively anchor anions and suppress their migration, while polyether chains facilitate homogeneous lithium&#8208;ion transport and diffusion. This synergistic effect increases the lithium&#8208;ion transference number, mitigates interfacial concentration polarization, and inhibits dendrite growth even at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Impressively, we demonstrate a 7 Ah PAP&#8208;Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell with ultra&#8208;high energy density (510&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and remarkable capacity stability (84.2%, 180 cycles), even under lean electrolyte (1.19&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) and high current density (3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Our findings highlight the potential of ion&#8208;sieving interlayer as a promising strategy for the development of stable Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Interfacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Interaction Promotes H2&#8208;Driven Enzymatic Asymmetric Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pickering emulsion microreactor was constructed for the recognition and assembly of the activated hydrogen mediator in H2&#8208;driven enzymatic asymmetric reduction based on an interfacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction, enabling directional H* transfer in the long reaction chain of chemoenzymatic asymmetric reduction.








Abstract
In situ H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration offers a sustainable approach for chemoenzymatic reduction in vitro; however, low selectivity in NAD(P)H formation, coupled with mutual deactivation between chemical catalysts and enzymes, severely compromises efficiency. Herein, we report the development of an oil&#8208;in&#8208;water Pickering emulsion microreactor leveraging an interfacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction to enable directional H* transfer, achieving&#160;&gt;99% selectivity in NADH regeneration. By further coupling this NADH regeneration system with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) catalyzed asymmetric reductive resolution of racemic 2&#8208;phenylpropionaldehyde to (S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanol, a chemoenzymatic Pickering emulsion microreactor was constructed, which smoothly catalyzed the H2&#8208;driven reductive resolution reaction and achieved an ee value&#160;&gt;99% with more than 2000 NADH regeneration cycles, representing a highest value ever reported for in situ H2&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. The efficiency of this chemoenzymatic microreactor is attributed to the high NADH selectivity and spatial separation of metal catalysts and HLADH. Insight into modulating mass transfer through noncovalent interactions and mitigating mutual deactivation of incompatible catalysts by spatial separation is promising for the development of efficient chemoenzymatic microreactors in sustainable chiral chemical production.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Mediated C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) Bond Cleavage to Promote Alcohols Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active oxygen species (e.g., active hydroxyl (OH*) or lattice oxygen) generated at the anode enable a green pathway for C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage, but the mechanism requires further investigation. This work constructed two model catalysts with distinct capacities to yield active oxygen species, among which Ni(Al)&#8208;LDH, producing abundant lattice oxygen, exhibited higher activity and drove selective C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage to promote alcohols electrooxidation via a Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism.








Abstract
Selective cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond is crucial for valorization of biomass, waste plastics and other organic compounds, while facing thermodynamic and kinetic barriers. Utilizing active oxygen species (e.g., active hydroxyl (OH*) or lattice oxygen) generated at the anode during water electrolysis provides a sustainable solution to achieve electrochemical activation of the C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond. However, elucidating the mechanisms of active oxygen species and their roles in enhancing product selectivity remains a challenge. Herein, we report a strategy to unravel the contribution of active oxygen species for C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage during alcohols electrooxidation, revealing that lattice oxygen promotes C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage and enhances product selectivity. We constructed NiAl&#8208;LDH and Ni(Al)&#8208;LDH as model catalysts, the latter derived through a &#8220;nano&#8208;tailoring&#8221; Al&#8208;leaching strategy. As a result, Ni(Al)&#8208;LDH facilitates lattice oxygen formation more readily, which acts as the primary active species for C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage and achieves &#8764;90% selectivity for formic acid production in ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). The intrinsic mechanism involves that lattice oxygen participates in EGOR via the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism and specifically induces C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage through an indirect pathway. This mechanistic insight into C(OH)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage mediated by lattice oxygen provides a valuable reference for designing selective catalysts in alcohols electrooxidation.

An efficient microdroplet&#8208;based strategy. The first example of in situ post&#8208;assembly modification of multifunctional metal&#8211;organic cages in microdroplets was achieved by Lin Xu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e22301), which enabled the covalent installation of twelve BODIPY chromophores per tetrahedral cage, producing multifunctional assemblies with efficient photosensitizing behavior. The strategy establishes microdroplet reactors as powerful biomimetic platforms for the rapid and precise construction, functionalization, and application of supramolecular architectures.

In their Research Article (e21118), Xiaohui He, Hongbing Ji, Graham J. Hutchings, and co&#8208;workers report a Pt1Aun/TiO2 catalyst with spatially separate H2 and O2 activation sites for direct synthesis of H2O2. H2 dissociates at Pt single&#8208;atom sites, O2 stabilizes at Au nanoparticle sites, and CH2OH acts as hydrogen carrier to transfer H, which combines with O2 on Au nanoparticles to form H2O2. It achieves &#8764;100% H2O2 selectivity, 128.6 mol&#183;gN.M.&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 productivity, and a &#8764;4 wt.% H2O2 concentration.

         <title>Reversible Dimensional Programming of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel reversible coordination&#8208;directed clip&#8208;off chemistry strategy for reversible dimensional programming of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Using this strategy, we have achieved reversible transformations between two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) COFs, as well as between three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and unprecedented 1.5&#8208;dimensional (1.5D) COFs.








Abstract
While the dimensionality of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a fundamental determinant of their physicochemical properties, their precise control remains a mystery and poses considerable challenges. Herein, we present a novel reversible coordination&#8208;directed clip&#8208;off chemistry strategy for reversible dimensional programming of COFs. Utilizing COFs containing coordinative Ag&#8211;N bonds as templates, structural transformation from a higher dimension to the lower one can be achieved by selectively cleaving these linkages. Noticeably, a 3D COF is converted into an unprecedented 1.5&#8208;dimensional (1.5D) COF, which is constructed with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) bonds but exhibits one&#8208;dimensional (1D) linear chains. This dimensional tailoring is fully reversible; reintroduction of Ag(I) repairs the cleaved bonds, restoring the original dimensions. Significantly, the derived lower&#8208;dimensional COFs exhibit markedly improved efficiency in extracting uranium from seawater and mining wastewater.

         <title>Localized Active H* Enrichment by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of additional nitrogen atoms into cobalt tetrapyrazinoporphyrazine (CoPhz) framework effectively modulates the electronic structure of cobalt center, promoting localized enrichment of active hydrogen (H*). Compared with cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), which exhibited limited H* generation, CoPhz demonstrated markedly enhanced electrocatalytic performance of nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3&#8722; RR) offers a sustainable route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis, simultaneously enabling pollutant remediation and resource recovery. The efficiency of NO3&#8722; RR relies on regulating the hydrogenation behaviors of active sites to drive the stepwise reduction of nitrate species. Herein, we report a molecular catalyst, cobalt tetrapyrazinoporphyrazine (CoPhz) supported on carbon nanotubes (CoPhz/CNT) that achieves outstanding NO3&#8722; RR performance through local active H* enrichment. In neutral electrolyte, CoPhz/CNT attained a peak NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93% and a yield rate of 8347.9&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, outperforming the conventional cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) benchmark. CoPhz/CNT exhibited exceptional stability for over 170&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Operando studies and theoretical calculations reveal that nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle modulate the electronic structure of the cobalt center, promoting H* generation and enrichment, as well as facilitating efficient intermediates conversion with low energy differences, leading to superior NO3&#8722; RR efficiency. Furthermore, the practical utility of CoPhz/CNT in a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; battery achieved an excellent power density of 14.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of macrocyclic catalysts is an effective strategy to tailor hydrogenation capability for enhanced NO3&#8722; RR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Dynamic Protonation on an Amino&#8208;Containing Quinone&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient Neutral Electrosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic amino groups in quinone&#8208;based COF (TfpBQ) can serve as efficient and dynamic proton mediators, which reconstructs a flexible *(H2O)3 network at the electrode surface, thereby enabling sustained proton supply to adjacent Q redox and optimizing the Q&#8208;mediated 2e&#8211; ORR pathway.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in neutral media is highly desirable for sustainable applications but is fundamentally limited by insufficient proton supply. Herein, we report a quinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Q&#8208;COFs) engineered with aromatic amino groups (TfpBQ) enables efficient neutral electrosynthesis of H2O2, achieved by the synergism between Q and amino groups. The amino groups serve as dynamic proton relays, boosting the interfacial proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (I&#8208;PCET) kinetics of the Q redox couples, as evidenced by a high apparent rate constant (kapp) of 1.97&#215;104 s&#8722;1, which is 43% and 92% higher than that of the imine&#8208; and amide&#8208;containing Q&#8208;COFs, respectively. Consequently, TfpBQ achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 19.3 mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.6% at 120 mA cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte, while demonstrating exceptional stability during 60&#8208;h of continuous operation. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the dynamic protonation of aromatic amino groups reconstructs the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond network, enabling a sustained proton supply to the adjacent Q/H2Q redox cycle, which in turn optimizes the overall 2e&#8211; ORR pathway. This work underscores the importance of managing dynamic protonation in electrocatalysts design for reactions occurring in proton&#8208;deficient microenvironment.

         <title>Experimental Isolation of Single Impact, Cumulative Energy, Aging, and Liquid&#8208;Assisted Grinding Effects in Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental framework is introduced to isolate single&#8208;impact and cumulative energy within a mechanochemical system. The guided, stepwise approach highlights the fundamental roles of impact events, post&#8208;impact reactivity, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding additives in all&#8208;solid mechanochemical reactions.








Abstract
Mechanochemical reactivity arises from a complex interplay between single impact energy, cumulative energy input, and secondary effects such as aging or liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG). Here, we experimentally isolate these factors across two fundamentally different all&#8208;solid reactions&#8211;the Finkelstein halogen exchange and the Wittig olefination&#8211;using a standardized single&#8208;ball mixer mill setup. Systematic variation of milling parameters revealed that both reactions are impact&#8208;driven but differ in how mechanical energy translates into chemical conversion. The halogen exchange exhibited pronounced aging, where the transformation continues after mechanical activation, highlighting the contribution of post&#8208;impact reactivity. In contrast, the Wittig olefination, free of such secondary effects, showed an almost ideal linear correlation between yield and cumulative energy (Etotal). LAG additives were found to modulate but not replace the impact&#8208;driven regime, providing mechanistic insight into the frequently observed sweet spot in LAG&#8208;assisted reactions.

         <title>HALOM Method: An Efficient and Accurate Neutron Diffraction&#8208;Independent Approach for Determining Hydrogen Locations in Metal Hydride Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a hydrogen atom locator for metal hydrides (HALOM) algorithm that enables rapid and accurate hydrogen position prediction in metal nanoclusters solely based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD)&#8208;derived metal frameworks, independent of neutron diffraction (ND) data and without exhaustive potential energy surface (PES) sampling.








Abstract
Metal hydride nanoclusters play important roles in catalytic transformations and energy conversion. However, accurate localization of hydrogen atoms in these nanoclusters remains a grand challenge. Traditional techniques face inherent limitations that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction cannot localize hydrides effectively, while neutron diffraction requires large single crystals and has limited accessibility. To address this challenge, we developed an innovative machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted hydrogen atom locator for metal hydrides (HALOM) algorithm for rapid and accurate hydrogen position prediction. This approach systematically searches potential hydrogen atom locations using a predefined potential function and refining these locations to minimize the total energy, which operates independently of neutron diffraction data and avoids exhaustive exploration of the potential energy surface (PES). In terms of prediction accuracy, HALOM fully reproduces neutron diffraction (ND)&#8208;identified hydride sites and aligns perfectly with density functional theory (DFT) models, and even yields lower&#8208;energy structures than literature DFT placements in some key systems (e.g., 2.86&#160;eV lower for Cu81H32). HALOM also demonstrates superior computational efficiency, which generates low&#8208;energy hydrogen configurations in only seconds, compared to the expensive PES exploration for hours. Overall, HALOM offers an efficient and accurate tool for hydrogen localization in metal hydride nanoclusters to advance their structure&#8208;property research.

         <title>Biocompatible TADF Probes for Highly Multiplexed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters were formulated into biocompatible nanoprobes for live&#8208;cell fluorescence lifetime imaging. A total of 36 TADF nanoprobes enabled the lifetime&#8208;based resolution of five bacterial populations within a single spectral window for multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies.








Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is an optical imaging modality that can provide multiplexed readouts with remarkable sensitivity to cellular microenvironments. Even though fluorescence lifetimes can distinguish fluorophores having overlapping spectral profiles, conventional fluorophores possess a narrow range of emission lifetimes (typically shorter than 5&#160;ns) that limits their potential for multiplexed imaging. In this work, we have systematically designed and evaluated a combination of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) nanoprobes for multiplexed FLIM. We have synthesized a collection of 36 TADF biocompatible nanoprobes with long and diverse fluorescence lifetimes in aqueous media (up to 15&#160;ns) and employed selected probes for live&#8208;cell imaging of bacterial cells under physiological conditions. By leveraging the exceptionally broad range of fluorescence lifetimes of these TADF emitters, we have achieved unprecedented simultaneous imaging of five nanoprobes within a single spectral window using a FLIM&#8208;phasor strategy. These findings demonstrate that TADF emitters are excellent scaffolds to unlock the capabilities of fluorescence lifetime imaging for multi&#8208;color biological studies.

A total of 36 TADF nanoprobes enabled the lifetime-based resolution of five bacterial populations within a single spectral window for multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is an optical imaging modality that can provide multiplexed readouts with remarkable sensitivity to cellular microenvironments. Even though fluorescence lifetimes can distinguish fluorophores having overlapping spectral profiles, conventional fluorophores possess a narrow range of emission lifetimes (typically shorter than 5&#160;ns) that limits their potential for multiplexed imaging. In this work, we have systematically designed and evaluated a combination of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) nanoprobes for multiplexed FLIM. We have synthesized a collection of 36 TADF biocompatible nanoprobes with long and diverse fluorescence lifetimes in aqueous media (up to 15&#160;ns) and employed selected probes for live-cell imaging of bacterial cells under physiological conditions. By leveraging the exceptionally broad range of fluorescence lifetimes of these TADF emitters, we have achieved unprecedented simultaneous imaging of five nanoprobes within a single spectral window using a FLIM-phasor strategy. These findings demonstrate that TADF emitters are excellent scaffolds to unlock the capabilities of fluorescence lifetime imaging for multi-color biological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Revision of the C16 Sesquiterpene Hegelenether and the Mechanism of C6&#8208;Methylation in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of the non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpene named hegelenether was revised to the structure of marxdiol, and its absolute configuration was assigned. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed the stereochemical course of the methyltransferase involved in its biosynthesis. The enzyme mechanism was further addressed through protein X&#8208;ray crystallography and structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.








Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical methylation events generate terpene structures that evade classical biosynthetic predictions, as exemplified by the proposed C16 terpene hegelenether. Here, we show that this natural product is misassigned and revise its structure to the dihydroxylated sesquiterpenoid marxdiol. Its absolute configuration and that of its precursor prekantenol pyrophosphate were determined through terpene synthase&#8208;mediated incorporation of stereoselectively labeled probes. To explain the initiating C6 methylation, we solved the crystal structure of the methyltransferase C6&#8208;FPP&#8208;MT with SAH and FPP, revealing a compact aromatic pocket that enforces Si&#8208;face methylation and Glu165&#8208;mediated deprotonation. These insights define how the active site controls regio&#8208; and stereochemistry and provide a structural basis for identifying related methyl&#8208;modified terpenes in uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of a Magnesium(0) Complex with a Polarized Mg&#948;&#8722;&#9472;Ca&#948;+ Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixing metals: The elusive unsupported two&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Mg&#9472;Ca bond has been realized by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate and amidinate ligands. Due to electronegativity differences (Mg: 1.31, Ca: 1.00) the formal oxidation states are Mg0&#9472;CaII. The polarized Mg&#948;&#175;&#9472;Ca&#948;+ bond is considerably more reactive than the established MgI&#9472;MgI bond.








Abstract
Despite numerous examples of Mg&#9472;Mg bound complexes, complexes with unsupported two&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Mg&#9472;Ca bonds so far always eluded their isolation. This is due to Mg&#948;&#175;&#8208;Ca&#948;+ polarization and their inherently very high reactivity resulting in oxidative addition to C&#9472;H bonds in either the ligand or solvent. Using a combination of bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI*) and amidinate (Am*) ligands, we now present (BDI*)Mg&#8208;Ca(Am*); BDI* = HC[C(tBu)N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl; Am* = tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr&#8208;phenyl. The crystal structure shows a Mg&#9472;Ca bond of 3.298&#160;&#197; and Mg/Ca NPA charges of&#160;+0.66/+1.28. This reflects considerable Mg&#948;&#175;&#8208;Ca&#948;+ polarization and is in line with the formal oxidation states Mg0&#8208;CaII. Effective&#8208;Oxidation&#8208;State (EOS) analysis confirms these formal oxidation states, but a low reliability index of 69.8% indicates that these are not fully representative for the electron distribution. Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules (AIM) shows a bond&#8208;critical&#8208;point on the Mg&#8211;Ca axis but a non&#8208;nuclear&#8208;attractor (NNA) was not observed. EDA&#8208;NOCV using two different fragmentations, (BDI*)Mg&#713;/(Am*)Ca+ or (BDI*)Mg&#9679;/(Am*)Ca&#9679;, shows that the complex is best described as a combination of neutral radicals. The Mg0&#8211;CaII/MgI&#8211;CaI ambiguity results in a highly reactive Mg&#948;&#175;&#9472;Ca&#948;+ bond. This is confirmed by its reaction with CyN&#9552;C&#9552;NCy and Ph2C&#9552;CH2 showing the electrophilic nature of Ca and nucleophilic reactivity for Mg.

         <title>Tuning pH for the Controlled Formation of Ultrasmall Nanoparticles with Direct Cytosolic Access</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;tuning platform is designed to encapsulate diverse drugs in aqueous solutions. Nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm can be generated and then stabilized through intra&#8208;polymer crosslinking. Machine learning models can be used to predict the drug loading and the resulting nanoparticle size. Experimental and computational results demonstrate the compact structure of the ultrasmall nanoparticles, which enables direct, energy&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery, bypassing endosome routine and thereby reducing associated intracellular trafficking barriers.








Abstract
Direct cytosolic delivery of nanoparticles offers advantages by circumventing the endocytic pathway, thereby reducing associated intracellular trafficking barriers. Several methods facilitate translocation across the cell membrane, including passive diffusion by ultrasmall nanoparticles. However, nanoparticles under 10&#160;nm pose challenges for drug loading due to rapid drug leaching or the need for complex, drug&#8208;specific synthesis. Here, we devise a polymer system to encapsulate a wide range of drugs in aqueous solutions; the key is adjusting the pH, leading to nanoparticle generation either below 10&#160;nm or above 50&#160;nm. Subsequent crosslinking ensures safe drug retention and stability. Machine learning is employed to link drug structure to its loading and nanoparticle size, identifying the pKaH of drugs as the critical parameter determining encapsulation conditions. MD simulations reveal the compact structure of the ultrasmall nanoparticles with a mixture of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity on the surface, which is ideal to achieve high engagement with cell membranes. Experimental evidence and computational simulations confirm the direct cytosolic delivery of these small nanoparticles, bypassing the endosomal route. In summary, this platform allows easy production of ultrasmall nanoparticles for diverse drugs, providing a robust strategy for improved intracellular delivery.

         <title>Combining ToF&#8208;SIMS and Multivariate Analysis to Resolve Active Sites on Ni&#8208;Based HER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS), combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution (MCR), disentangles ultrathin mixtures of Ni, NiO, and Ni(OH)2 on model Ni electrodes. By revealing a hydroxide&#8208;specific ion marker linked to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, the method offers a new framework for identifying catalytically active sites.








Abstract
Unambiguous identification of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis remains a major challenge, particularly for materials with ultrathin, chemically mixed surface layers. Here, we demonstrate a generalizable approach that combines time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) with multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis [PCA] and multivariate curve resolution [MCR]) to resolve catalytically relevant motifs at the nanoscale. Using Ni electrodes as a model system, PCA distinguished hydroxide&#8208;enriched domains from oxide&#8208; and metal&#8208;rich regions, while MCR decomposed depth profiles and 3D images into hydroxide, oxide, and metallic layers with nanometer resolution. A unique secondary&#8208;ion fragment, NiO3H3&#8722; (m/z 108.94), emerged as a marker of hydroxide&#8208;rich environments and correlated with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity across a series of Ni electrodes. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ni(OH)2 clusters adjacent to metallic Ni offer the most favorable water dissociation energetics, establishing the structural origin of the marker. While illustrated here for Ni&#8208;based HER, this workflow provides a broadly applicable framework to isolate and rank near&#8208;surface patterns that govern catalytic activity, thereby extending ToF&#8208;SIMS from a qualitative probe to a predictive tool for active site identification.

While illustrated here for Ni-based HER, this workflow provides a broadly applicable framework to isolate and rank near-surface patterns that govern catalytic activity, thereby extending ToF-SIMS from a qualitative probe to a predictive tool for active site identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pickering Emulsion Interfaces Enhance Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of Aromatic C&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel continuous&#8208;flow interfacial photocatalytic system based on Pickering emulsions for the regulation of ROS generation and practical application of photocatalysis is presented. As exemplified by the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene, this system features long&#8208;term operational stability, enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity and no need for sacrificial agents.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis provides a promising route for the green synthesis of high value&#8208;added oxygenated chemicals through oxidization of C&#9472;H bonds. However, improving the photocatalytic selectivity without compromising its activity remains a grand challenge due to the difficulty in controlling the generation of desired reactive oxygen species during the reaction. Here, based on Pickering emulsions, we constructed an interfacial photocatalytic system to enhance the photocatalytic selectivity, exemplified by the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene. Positioning a photocatalyst, bismuth bromide oxide flakes, at the outer side of Pickering emulsion droplet interfaces can regulate the concentrations of generated superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals, resulting in&#160;&gt;99.0% ethylbenzene conversion and&#160;&gt;99.0% selectivity towards acetophenone under visible light irradiation. Theoretical calculations and experimental investigations reveal that (i) the loose hydrogen bonding at the outer interfaces of Pickering emulsion droplets increases the dissociation barrier of water molecules, inhibiting the formation of hydroxyl radicals; (ii)&#160; this system can create an oxygen&#8208;rich lipophilic solvation environment which facilitates the chemisorption of oxygen and the generation of superoxide anion radicals. Furthermore, this system can work well in a continuous&#8208;flow fashion with high activity and long&#8208;term operational stability (200&#160;h), illustrating appealing potentials for practical photocatalytic synthesis.

         <title>A Crystalline Mono&#8208;Coordinate Indium(I)&#8208;Phosphaalkenyl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox neutral carbometallation of a phospha&#8208;alkyne using the dimeric indium(I) compound (InTer)2 is reported. This reaction affords a mono&#8208;coordinate indium(I) compound that can reversibly extrude the phospha&#8208;alkyne upon addition of a Lewis acid.








Abstract
The synthesis of the mono&#8208;coordinate indium(I) compound In[C(Ad)&#9552;PTer] (Ad&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;adamantyl, Ter&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) is reported. Key to the formation of this monomeric species is the steric protection offered by the supporting phosphaalkenyl ligand which hinders aggregation. The title compound can be accessed from the reaction of (InTer)2 with the phosphaalkyne AdC&#8801;P in an unusual redox&#8208;neutral transformation in which the In&#9472;C bond of the (InTer)2 precursor, known to dissociate in solution, adds across the C&#8801;P triple bond of the phosphaalkyne. This insertion reaction is reversible, as shown by the reaction of In[C(Ad)&#9552;PTer] with B(C6F5)3, which affords [TerInB(C6F5)3] accompanied by extrusion of AdC&#8801;P. In contrast, the lighter analogue (GaTer)2 promotes the dimerization of the AdC&#8801;P fragment resulting in the formation of the cluster (GaTer)2(AdCP)2. The formal oxidation state of In[C(Ad) = PTer] was probed by reaction with methyl&#8208;iodide which affords the indium(III) compound In(Me)I[C(Ad) = PTer] in a formal single&#8208;site oxidative&#8208;addition reaction at indium.

         <title>Hydrothermal Annealing of Hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites Improves Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermal annealing method is introduced as an effective route to improve the activity and lifetime of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts. This post&#8208;synthesis treatment, which was demonstrated on four nanosized and hierarchical zeolites and one commercial material, uses a siliceous growth solution at approximate solubility of zeolite MFI with high temperature to improve the physicochemical properties of ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts for wide&#8208;ranging applications.








Abstract
Engineering next&#8208;generation zeolite catalysts requires state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis techniques to tailor the properties of materials along with robust methods to evaluate their catalytic performance. Here, we introduce hydrothermal annealing as a facile and highly effective method to improve the activity and lifetime of zeolite catalysts. This post&#8208;synthesis treatment uses a siliceous growth solution at approximate solubility of zeolite crystals with high temperature to alter the physicochemical properties of as&#8208;synthesized materials. We employ the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process as a benchmark reaction, along with a wide range of characterization techniques, to assess the impact of annealing on four nanosized and hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 materials compared to a commercial sample. Our findings reveal that annealing significantly increased cumulative MTH turnover without appreciably altering product selectivity, despite non&#8208;obvious changes to zeolite structure as a result of the annealing process. Comparisons of catalyst performance are made under identical reaction conditions using a descriptor that correlates cumulative turnovers to compositional, mass transport, and textural properties of each material &#8211; in line with growing efforts to increase rigor and reproducibility in the field of catalysis. The collective approach used in this study serves as a guideline for establishing structure&#8208;composition&#8208;performance relationships for zeolite&#8208;based catalysts across wide&#8208;ranging applications.
