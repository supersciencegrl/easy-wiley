         <title>Enhanced Band Convergence and Ultra&#8208;low Thermal Conductivity Synergistically Lead to High Thermoelectric Performance in SnTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SnTe, a structural analogue of champion thermoelectric material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we have demonstrated a co&#8208;doping strategy to improve the thermoelectric performance of SnTe via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and phonon transport. The electrical transport is optimized by 3 mol% Ag doping in self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te). Further, Mg doping in SnAg0.03Te resulted in highly converged valence bands, which enhanced the Seebeck coefficient markedly. The energy gap between the light and heavy hole valence bands (DEv) decreases to 0.10 eV in Ag and Mg co&#8208;doped SnTe compared to the value of 0.35 eV in pristine SnTe. As a result of optimized p&#8208;type carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands, we obtained a high power factor of ~27 mW/cmK2 at 865 K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te reached to an ultra&#8208;low value of ~ 0.23 W/mK at 865 K due to the formation of MgTe nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. With this synergy among optimized carrier concentration, enhanced valence band convergence and ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained a high thermoelectric figure of merit, zT ~1.55 at 865 K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Biology of Werner&#8217;s Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Werner&#8217;s Complex, as a cationic coordination complex (CCC), has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. Competitive inhibitor and spectroscopic assays confirm the high affinity to GAGs heparin, heparan sulfate (HS) and its pentasaccharide mimetic Fondaparinux (FPX). Functional consequences of this affinity include inhibition of FPX cleavage by bacterial heparinase and mammalian heparanase enzymes with inhibition of cellular invasion and migration. Werner&#8217;s Complex is a very efficient condensing agent for DNA and tRNA. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for translational implications, it is demonstrated to display antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of these properties, opening new avenues of research for this iconic compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocyclic and Dicyclic Dehydro[20]annulenes Integrated with Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral  ortho  &#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74 m  2  g  &#8208;1  . A moderate electron mobility of 0.05 cm  2  &#160;V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicine offers an effective way to regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We herein report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; while the later exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing its tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumor and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Concurrently, the released DMC inhibits PP2A activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Element Migration over Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts and its Impact on Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In 2  O 3  , ZnO, Cr 2  O 3  , and ZrO 2  ) to combine with H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 for the hydrogenation of CO 2  to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion&#8208;exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C 2+  hydrocarbon products over In 2  O 3  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZnO/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr 2  O 3  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZrO 2  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts with high selectivity of C 2+  hydrocarbons. This work preliminarily unveils the overlooked element migration and its profound impact on the catalytic behaviors of bifunctional catalysts for CO/CO 2  hydrogenation, providing insights into the rational design of emerging multifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular protein&#8208;drug interactions probed by direct mass spectrometry of cell lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding protein&#8208;ligand interactions in a cellular context is an important goal in molecular biology and biochemistry, and particularly for drug development. Investigators must demonstrate that drugs penetrate cells and specifically bind their targets. Towards that end, we present a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells. This method is based on our previously introduced direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. Here, direct&#8208;MS enables label&#8208;free studies of protein&#8208;drug binding in human cells and is used to determine binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples. We anticipate that this method will enable the application of native MS to a range of problems where cellular context is important, including protein&#8208;protein interactions, drug uptake and binding, and characterization of therapeutic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;ion Binding Mediates the Reversible Interconversion of Cis and Trans Peroxido&#160;Dicopper Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu  2  O  2  ) featured in type III copper proteins (e.g. hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O  2  transport and substrate oxidation in a range of organisms.  &#956;  &#8208;1,2&#8208;  cis  peroxido dicopper cores (  C  P  ) have been proposed as key structures involved in the early stages of O  2  binding in these proteins, and their reversible isomerization to other Cu  2  O  2  cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic  C  P  cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of  C  P  Cu  2  O  2  species remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report our combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies which detail the first reversible interconversion of&#160;  &#956;  &#8208;1,2&#8208;  trans  peroxido (  T  P  ) and  C  P  dicopper cores. Ca  II  mediates this process through reversible binding at the Cu  2  O  2  core, and highlights the unique capability for metal&#8208;ion binding events to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O  2  &#160;activation in biomimetic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminocatalytic [8+2] Cycloadditions toward Chiral Cyclazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and exceptionally stereoselective synthesis toward chiral cycl[3.2.2]azines has been realized, by means of the rational design and utilization of novel (  E  )&#8208;3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;3  H  &#8208;pyrrolizines in iminium&#8208;ion catalyzed [8+2] cycloadditions. The presented protocol allows for the incorporation of diverse enals, including cinnamaldehydes, enolizable aldehydes, and substrates of extended conjugation. The obtained products contain both an electron&#8208;rich alkenyl&#8208;pyrrole moiety and an electron&#8208;deficient carbaldehyde substituent, and both moieties can undergo selective transformations with retention of the stereochemical information established in the [8+2] cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Cytochrome P450 Catalyzing C&#8722;S Bond Formation in S&#8208;Heterocyclization of Chuangxinmycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450 CxnD exhibited C&#8722;S bond forming activity in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis, generating the unique tricyclic indole&#8208;S&#8208;hetero scaffold from thiol intermediates. Structural characterization of CxnD with a substrate analogue proposed a radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate.







Abstract
Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities, but the C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8722;S bond forming activity in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of triplet dioxygen with closed shell molecules is formally spin&#8208;forbidden. Nature overcomes this prohibition by a variety of enzymes. The surprising reactivity of calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate with O2 is described and the spin&#8208;inversion process is analyzed. The square&#8208;planar aluminates transpire as enzyme models that substantiate the critical role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and structural constraint for the functions of aerobic life.







Abstract
The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8211;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.

         <title>CeCl3/n&#8208;BuLi: Unraveling Imamoto's Organocerium Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seamless low&#8208;temperature syntheses, crystallization and spectroscopies provide structural details of the heterobimetallic reagent routinely used for regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyl compounds. 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy takes on an important role here, tracking down n&#8208;BuLi dissociation.







Abstract
CeCl3(thf) reacts at low temperatures with MeLi, t&#8208;BuLi, and n&#8208;BuLi to isolable organocerium complexes. Solvent&#8208;dependent extensive n&#8208;BuLi dissociation is revealed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy, suggesting &#8220;Ce(n&#8208;Bu)3(thf)x&#8221; or solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs like &#8220;[Li(thf)4][Ce(n&#8208;Bu)4(thf)y]&#8221; as as the dominant species of the Imamoto reagent. The stability of complexes Li3Ln(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 increases markedly with decreasing LnIII size. Closer inspection of the solution behavior of crystalline Li3Lu(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 and mixtures of LuCl3(thf)2/n&#8208;BuLi in THF indicates occurring n&#8208;BuLi dissociation only at molar ratios of &lt;1:3. n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;depleted complex LiLu(n&#8208;Bu)3Cl(tmeda)2 was obtained by treatment of Li2Lu(n&#8208;Bu)5(tmeda)2 with ClSiMe3, at the expense of LiCl incorporation. Imamoto's ketone/tertiary alcohol transformation was examined with 1,3&#8208;diphenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, affording 99&#8201;% of alcohol.

Direct photogeneration of free charge carriers enabled by remarkable low exciton binding energies is demonstrated in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptor of Y6 by a joint experimental and theoretical study. This results in efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets in the high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18&#8201;% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (Eb) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small Eb of &#8722;0.11&#8211;0.15&#8197;eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak Eb in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.

         <title>Stabilization of an Enantiopure Sub&#8208;monolayer of Helicene Radical Cations on a Au(111) Surface through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on noncovalent interactions has been developed to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chirality of the molecules being retained at the nanoscale.







Abstract
In the past few years, the chirality and magnetism of molecules have received notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine both these properties, and thus their nanostructuration is the first step toward developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chemical structure of these molecules being maintained at the nanoscale, as demonstrated by in&#8208;house characterizations. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.

         <title>Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Metal Battery Achieved by a Safe Electrolyte Based on Recyclable and Low&#8208;Cost Molecular Sieve</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite was used to sieve the excess solvents within Li&#8208;ion solvation sheaths of typical carbonate electrolyte to eliminate the adverse effects (high&#8208;voltage/temperature oxidation, unstable CEI/SEI). As a result, high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal battery (LMB) that used this zeolite sieved electrolyte demonstrated a significantly improved cycling time and safety, but largely reduced production cost.







Abstract
As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF6&#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6&#8197;volts) and elevated temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000&#8197;cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300&#8197;cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

Moreover, S@pPAN cathode inherited a neat solid-phase redox reaction and fully eliminated the dissolution of lithium polysulfides.&#160; Finally, we harvested a long-life Li-S@pPAN pouch cell with slight Li metal excessive (0.4 time) and ultra-lean electrolyte design (1 &#181;L mg  S  -1  ), delivering 394 W h kg  -1  energy density based on electrodes and electrolyte mass.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactivity of Bottlebrush and Dendronized Polymers: Solid vs Solution States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored the mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers in solution (with ultrasonication, US) and solid states (with ball&#8208;mill grinding, BMG). Over 50 polymers were prepared with varying backbone length and arm architecture, composition, and size. With US, we found that bottlebrush and dendronized polymers exhibited consistent backbone scission behavior, which was related to their elongated conformations in solution. Considerably different behavior was observed with BMG, as arm architecture and composition had a significant impact on backbone scission rates. Arm scission was also observed for bottlebrush polymers in both solution and solid states, but only in the solid state for dendronized polymers. Motivated by these results, multi&#8208;mechanophore polymers with bottlebrush and dendronized polymer architectures were prepared and their reactivity was compared. Although dendronized polymers showed slower arm&#8208;scission, the selectivity for mechanophore activation was much higher. Overall, these results have important implications to the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 by stable Ni nanocrystal on porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths at reduced temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of CH  4  /CO  2  provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large&#8208;scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH  4  /CO  2  . We show the complete conversion of CH  4  /CO  2  even only at 700&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500 hours. The well&#8208;defined and catalytically active Ni&#8208;MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance. Our findings would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the &#8220;Nanocrystal On Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Monoliths&#8221; technique could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering competitive routes for Ni&#8208;based nanoparticle electrodeposition by an operando optical monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrodeposition of earth&#8208;abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses as the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material. Herein, the complexity of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) is unravelled  operando  and at a single entity NP level by optical microscopy correlated to  ex situ  SEM imaging. Our correlative approach allows differentiating the dynamics of formation of two different NP populations, metallic Ni and Ni(OH)  2  with a &lt;25nm limit of detection (l.o.d.), their formation being ruled by the competition between Ni  2+  and water reduction. At the single NP level this results from a self&#8208;terminated growth, an information which is most often hidden in ensemble averaged measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of Aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8211;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the tunability of these NHC single&#8208;electron operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate&#8208;dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst tunability is harnessed in the visible&#8208;light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of these tunable single&#8208;electron NHC operators.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a KIO  4  &#8208;mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one&#8208;pot C3(  sp  2  )&#8208;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated  in situ  via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs,  e.g.,  Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of high throughput synthesis and high throughput protein crystallography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;ligand crystallography is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to generate starting points for medicinal chemistry by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in protein crystallography could allow for a more integrated role of protein crystallography into the early drug discovery cycle. Here we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput crystallography. For this we describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to high diversity acrylamides and esters from diverse building blocks. Surprisingly, in the majority of acrylamides precipitation during the reaction was observed, making library synthesis on a mmol scale and a 96&#8208;well format particularly comfortable. The synthesis is also suitable for a high throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. Moreover, we exemplified the synthesis on a multigram scale featuring good yield and simple work&#8208;up. High throughput crystallography of our libraires yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a time efficient manner. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of  in situ  HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT crystallography has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;cleavable linkers for protein chemical synthesis through solid&#8208;phase ligations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of long proteins requires the assembly of multiple fragments through successive ligations. The need for intermediate purifications is a strong limitation, as this generally leads to low to very low overall yields. An early&#8208;recognized solution to this problem is the assembly of the protein on a solid support, but no mature solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation (SPCL) technology has yet emerged. One of the main reasons lies in the difficulty to immobilize a first peptide segment on a SPCL&#8208;compatible solid support through a linker that can be cleaved under very mild conditions to release the assembled protein. A wide range of SPCL linkers have been developed but their cleavage requires chemical conditions sometimes incompatible with sensitive protein targets. Here, we describe the exploration of an alternative enzymatic approach in order to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support was a key for the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the native chemical ligation&#8208;based assembly of three peptide segments to afford a 15 kDa polypeptide.</dc:description>

Here, we describe the exploration of an alternative enzymatic approach in order to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support was a key for the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the native chemical ligation-based assembly of three peptide segments to afford a 15 kDa polypeptide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemical Reactions of Redox Cofactor Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox cofactors mediate many enzymatic processes and are increasingly employed in biomedical and energy applications. Exploring the influence of external magnetic fields on redox cofactor chemistry can enhance our understanding on magnetic field&#8208;sensitive biological processes and allow the application of magnetic fields to modulate redox reactions involving cofactors. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on electrochemical reactions in redox cofactor solutions. By employing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor as a model system, we characterize magnetically induced changes in Faradaic currents. We find that radical pair intermediates have negligible influence on current increases in FMN solution upon application of a magnetic field. The dominant mechanism underlying the observed current increases is the magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect. We extend our analyses to other diffusion&#8208;limited electrochemical reactions of redox cofactor solutions and arrive at similar conclusions, highlighting the opportunity to use this framework in redox cofactor chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>An Element&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutadiene Exhibiting High&#8208;Energy Blue Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3,2,4&#8208;Diazadiboretidine, an isoelectronic heteroanalog of cyclobutadiene, is an interesting chemical species in terms of comparison with the carbon system, whereas its properties have never been investigated experimentally. According to Baird&#8217;s rule,&#160;H&#252;ckel antiaromatic&#160;cyclobutadiene acquires aromaticity in the lowest triplet state. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies on the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state&#160;antiaromaticity/aromaticity as well as the photophysical properties of an isolable 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidine derivative. The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B  2  N  2&#160;  ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B  2  N  2&#160;  ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence. The finding of these peculiar photophysical properties for the element&#8208;substituted cyclobutadiene provides new design guidelines for photofunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The surging development of bioorthogonal chemistry has profoundly transformed chemical biology over the last two decades. Involving chemical partners that specifically react together in highly complex biological fluids, this branch of chemistry now allows researchers to probe biomolecules in their natural habitat through metabolic labelling technologies. Chemical reporter strategies include metabolic glycan labelling, site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids in proteins, or nucleic acid postsynthetic labelling. While a majority of literature reports marks cell&#8208;surface exposed targets, implementing bioorthogonal ligations in the interior of cells constitutes a more challenging task. Owing to limiting factors such as reagent membrane permeability, fluorescence background due to hydrophobic interactions and off&#8208;target covalent binding, or perfectible kinetics/stability balances, these strategies need mindful planning to achieve success. In this review, we emphasize the hurdles encountered when targeting biomolecules localized in cell organelles, and wish to give an easily&#8208;accessible summary of the strategies at hand for imaging intracellular targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Synergistically Enhanced Hyperpolarizability: Chiral Coordination Polymers with Nonpolar Structures Exhibiting Unusually Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four chiral coordination polymers (CPs), M[(  S  ,  S  )&#8208;C  14  H  14  N  2  O  6  ] and M[(  R  ,  R  )&#8208;C  14  H  14  N  2  O  6  ] (M = Zn or Cd), have been exclusively synthesized in high yields with the aid of newly designed chiral ligand under hydrothermal condition. The CPs crystallizing in the orthorhombic nonpolar space group,  C  222  1  , reveal three&#8208;dimensional framework structures composed of MO  4  tetrahedra and the corresponding homochiral linkers. Powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that the nonpolar CPs reveal very strong SHG efficiency of  ca.  5&#8211;9 times that of KH  2  PO  4  and exhibit type&#8208;I phase&#8208;matching behavior. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the unusually large SHG efficiency found from the nonpolar CPs should be attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and enhanced hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Bulk Morphology in Efficient Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of photoactive materials, the morphology of donor:acceptor (D:A) photovoltaic films can be effectively adjusted. A large D:A ESP difference is required to assist charge generation, but too large ESP difference may result in additional nonradiative recombination loss and lead to hypermiscibility issues.







Abstract
Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a key role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thus determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. Herein, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. We show that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. Enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Fine&#8208;tuning the bulk morphology can give balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), neat or surface&#8208;modified with mesogenic motifs, transmit their inherent structural and morphological chirality to an achiral nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) elastic medium with a helical twisting power rivaling the most potent organic chiral dopants. The helical pitch, p, of the induced chiral N*&#8208;LC phase is tightened even when CNCs are decorated with achiral molecules bearing structural resemblance to the N&#8208;LC host.







Abstract
The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.

         <title>Purification of Propylene and Ethylene by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Mediated by Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of the host&#8211;guest chemistry of MFM&#8208;520 at a molecular level rationalises the observed high selectivity towards olefins, and informs future designs of improved materials for challenging olefin/paraffin separations in industry.







Abstract
Industrial purification of propylene and ethylene requires cryogenic distillation and selective hydrogenation over palladium catalysts to remove propane, ethane and/or trace amounts of acetylene. Here, we report the excellent separation of equimolar mixtures of propylene/propane and ethylene/ethane, and of a 1/100 mixture of acetylene/ethylene by a highly robust microporous material, MFM&#8208;520, under dynamic conditions. In situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and analysis of adsorption thermodynamic parameters reveal that a series of synergistic host&#8211;guest interactions involving hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions underpin the cooperative binding of alkenes within the pore. Notably, the optimal pore geometry of the material enables selective accommodation of acetylene. The practical potential of this porous material has been demonstrated by fabricating mixed&#8208;matrix membranes comprising MFM&#8208;520, Matrimid and PIM&#8208;1, and these exhibit not only a high permeability for propylene (&#8776;1984 Barrer), but also a separation factor of 7.8 for an equimolar mixture of propylene/propane at 298&#8197;K.

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxides undergo rapid homolytic substitution with alkyl radicals. This has enabled the development of an oxidative photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides as well as a related approach for the installation of a disulfide moiety by remote C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
The direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that reacts with a trisulfide dioxide through homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared by a newly described approach. 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8722;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve the &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H disulfuration of amides through a radical relay sequence. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 versus S3 of the trisulfide dioxides have been explored.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Bis(tricyanoborane)imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate Anion&#8212;A Ditopic Dianionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedentedly stable salts of the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate ion with different types of counterions were obtained on large scale. Deprotonation of the imidazolate ion provided access to the corresponding dianionic NHC that acts as ditopic ligand.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate anion 1 was obtained in high yield from lithium imidazolate and B(CN)3&#8722;pyridine adduct. Anion 1 is chemically very robust and thus allowed the isolation of the corresponding H5O2+ salt. Furthermore, monoanion 1 served as starting species for the novel dianionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion 3 that acts as ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups at boron. First reactions of this new NHC 3 with methyl iodide, elemental selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] led to the methylated imidazolate ion 4, the dianionic selenium adduct 5, and the dianionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 6. These NHC derivatives provide a first insight into the electronic and steric properties of the dianionic NHC 3. Especially the combination of properties, such as double negative charge, different coordination sites, large buried volume and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability, make NHC 3 a unique and promising ligand and building block.

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;temperature performances of zinc&#8211;air batteries are systematically investigated from both theoretical and experimental aspects in terms of feasibility verification, bottleneck analysis, and promotion strategies.







Abstract
Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500&#8197;cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8&#8197;V at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Manginoids&#8197;A and&#8197;C and Guignardones&#8197;A and&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total syntheses of fungal meroterpenoids, manginoids&#8197;A and C, as well as guignardones&#8197;A and C, are accomplished. This divergent and bioinspired synthetic strategy involves a Csp3&#8722;Csp2 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of vinyl bromide, silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement, and oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthetic approach for preparing manginoids and guignardones, two types of biogenetically related meroterpenoids, is reported. This bioinspired and divergent synthesis employs an oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization and cyclodehydration of the common precursor to forge the central ring of the manginoids and guignardones, respectively, at a late stage. Key synthetic steps include silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement to form the 6&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton and the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction of vinyl bromide to achieve fragment coupling. This synthesis protocol enables the asymmetric syntheses of four fungal meroterpenoids from commercially available materials.

         <title>Direct and Enantioselective Aldol Reactions Catalyzed by Chiral Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appropriate and simultaneous activation of robust and easily to handle [Tol&#8208;BINAP]NiCl2 and aromatic aldehydes with TIPSOTf orchestrates a direct, asymmetric, and catalytic aldol reaction of a wide array of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones. This method enables the corresponding TIPS&#8208;protected anti aldol adducts to be obtained in a highly efficient and atom economical manner.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;acyl thiazinanethiones with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes is reported. The reaction gives the corresponding O&#8208;TIPS&#8208;protected anti&#8208;aldol adducts in high yields and with remarkable stereocontrol and atom economy. Furthermore, the straightforward removal of the achiral scaffold provides enantiomerically pure intermediates of synthetic interest, which involve precursors for anti&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy carboxylic derivatives. Theoretical calculations explain the observed high stereocontrol.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Assisted Hydrogenation of Oximes to Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes are found to be efficient catalysts for homogeneous oxime hydrogenation to hydroxylamine products. Only if equipped with an aryl&#8208;imine ligand and operating under strong acidic conditions. Remarkably they do not hydrogenolyse the fragile N&#8722;O bond. Experimental evidence suggests an unusual acid&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogenation mechanism which may be applicable to the reduction of other challenging substrates.







Abstract
We found that cyclometalated cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes are uniquely efficient catalysts in homogeneous hydrogenation of oximes to hydroxylamine products. A stable iridium C,N&#8208;chelation is crucial, with alkoxy&#8208;substituted aryl ketimine ligands providing the best catalytic performance. Several Ir&#8208;complexes were mapped by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis in order to collect steric parameters that might guide a rational design of even more active catalysts. A broad range of oximes and oxime ethers were activated with stoichiometric amounts of methanesulfonic acid and reduced at room temperature, remarkably without cleavage of the fragile N&#8722;O bond. The exquisite functional group compatibility of our hydrogenation system was further demonstrated by additive tests. Experimental mechanistic investigations support an ionic hydrogenation platform, and suggest a role for the Br&#248;nsted acid beyond a proton source. Our studies provide deep understanding of this novel acidic hydrogenation and may facilitate its improvement and application to other challenging substrates.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ordered Mesoporous Carbonaceous Hybrid Nanostructures with Molecularly Dispersed Polyoxometallates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy is developed for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores, which exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol.







Abstract
Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100&#8201;%) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80&#8197;h).

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large telluroxane clusters are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of [PhTe]2 with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. They consist of two half&#8208;spheres with {(PhTe)19O24}9+ networks, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere can be replaced by other metal ions. Mass spectrometry shows that the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.







Abstract
Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)19O24}2I18(solv)] (1) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)19O24}9+ network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)18({Ca(H2O)2}O24}2I16] (2) and [{(PhTe)18({Y(NO3)(H2O)}O24}2I16] (3). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H2O}2}2+ and {Y(NO3)(H2O)}2+ building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence Compounds as Polarizing Agents for Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization in Solids**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;valence compounds were investigated as novel polarizing agents for DNP NMR. These compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, they can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP NMR experiments in solid state, and they specifically show favorable properties for applications at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields (DNP=dynamic nuclear polarization, NMR=nuclear magnetic resonance).







Abstract
Herein, we investigate a novel set of polarizing agents&#8212;mixed&#8208;valence compounds&#8212;by theoretical and experimental methods and demonstrate their performance in high&#8208;field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR experiments in the solid state. Mixed&#8208;valence compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, such polarizing agents can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP experiments in the solid state, with favorable conditions for dynamic nuclear polarization formation at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields.

         <title>Atomic Sulfur Filling Oxygen Vacancies Optimizes H Absorption and Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>

Sulfur&#8208;atom doping of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 results in the occupation of the oxygen vacancies. S sites in the S&#8208;NiFe2O4 likely adsorb H adatoms and form S&#8208;H* in situ, which boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that the lowered energy barrier for H2O dissociation induced by S doping is the key reason for the remarkable HER performance.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually has sluggish kinetics in alkaline solution due to the difficulty in forming binding protons. Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (VO) of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (S&#8208;NiFe2O4) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61&#8197;mV at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 60&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;Acm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S&#8208;H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H2O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S&#8208;NiFe2O4.

         <title>Kinetic Microscale Thermophoresis for Simultaneous Measurement of Binding Affinity and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13988-13995, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extension of microscale thermophoresis (MST) to perform temperature jumps by increasing the heat dissipation of the sample allows for quantification of binding affinities together with the kinetic rates. Relaxation kinetics for DNA hybridization were measured with high fidelity at different temperatures and various experimental conditions. The results shed light on the hybridization mechanism of DNA and confirmed determinants of DNA binding.







Abstract
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a versatile technique to measure binding affinities of binder&#8211;ligand systems, based on the directional movement of molecules in a temperature gradient. We extended MST to measure binding kinetics as well as binding affinity in a single experiment by increasing the thermal dissipation of the sample. The kinetic relaxation fingerprints were derived from the fluorescence changes during thermodynamic re&#8208;equilibration of the sample after local heating. Using this method, we measured DNA hybridization on&#8208;rates and off&#8208;rates in the range 104&#8211;106&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 10&#8722;4&#8211;10&#8722;1&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. We observed the expected exponential dependence of the DNA hybridization off&#8208;rates on salt concentration, strand length and inverse temperature. The measured on&#8208;rates showed a linear dependence on salt concentration and weak dependence on strand length and temperature. For biomolecular interactions with large enthalpic contributions, the kinetic MST technique offers a robust, cost&#8208;effective and immobilization&#8208;free determination of kinetic rates and binding affinity simultaneously, even in crowded solutions.

Abstract
A dual modulation strategy of consecutive nucleation and confined growth of Li metal is proposed by using the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivative hollow capsule with inbuilt lithiophilic Au or Co&#8208;O nanoparticle (NP) seeds as heterogeneous host. The seeding&#8208;induced nucleation enables the negligible overpotential and promotes the inward injection of Li mass into the abundant cavities in host, followed by the conformal plating of Li on the outer surface of host during discharging. This modulation alleviates the dendrite growth and volume expansion of Li plating. The interconnected porous host network enables enhancement of cycling and rate performances of Li metal (a lifespan over 1200&#8197;h for Au&#8208;seeding symmetric cells, and an endurance of 220&#8197;cycles under an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for corresponding asymmetric cells). The hollow capsules integrated with lithiophilic seeds solve the deformation problem of Li metal for durable and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsiveness from the Molecular to the Supramolecular Level via Platination of Pentacenes</title>

Single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems have been constructed on the basis of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes, which display high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency from the molecular to the supramolecular level.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsiveness is important for various applications. Currently, single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems are rare compared to systems that display two&#8208;photon absorption and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation processes. Supramolecular stacking of photo&#8208;responsive chromophores results in decreased efficiency due to space&#8208;confinement effects. Herein we show that &#963;&#8208;platination of pentacenes is a feasible protocol to build single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems, with advantages including a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, high photochemical efficiency, and pathway specificity. The pentacene&#8208;to&#8208;endoperoxidation transformation is accompanied by color and absorbance changes. The high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes facilitates NIR responsiveness in one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers, resulting in the disappearance of supramolecular chirality signals and disruption of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers. Overall, the &#963;&#8208;platination strategy opens up new avenues toward NIR photo&#8208;responsive materials at the molecular and supramolecular levels.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insights into C&#8722;S Bond Formation in Gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14188-14194, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of structural biology, mutagenesis, natural product isolation and activity assays provides insights into the formation of two carbon&#8722;sulfur bonds in the fungal virulence factor gliotoxin and related epipolythiodioxopiperazine natural products. The exceptional glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferase GliG uses an unusual bis&#8208;hydroxylated gliotoxin precursor and successively links two molecules of glutathione.







Abstract
Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulfur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulfurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8722;sulfur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified A. fumigatus strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety.

     alt="Structural and Mechanistic Insights into C&#8722;S Bond Formation in Gliotoxin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combination of structural biology, mutagenesis, natural product isolation and activity assays provides insights into the formation of two carbon&#8722;sulfur bonds in the fungal virulence factor gliotoxin and related epipolythiodioxopiperazine natural products. The exceptional glutathione-S-transferase GliG uses an unusual bis-hydroxylated gliotoxin precursor and successively links two molecules of glutathione.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulfur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulfurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8722;sulfur linkage formation from a bis-hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Phe-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ser]-bis-glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified A. fumigatus strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme-mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8722;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.&lt;/p&gt;

Acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air&#8208;stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was attained with the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Reduced Arene Complexes of Hafnium Supported by a Triamidoamine Ligand</title>

A reduced anthracene complex of hafnium(IV) reacts with two equivalents of benzonitrile to form the hafnium&#8208;bis(iminyl) as the kinetic product that expulses one equivalent of benzonitrile to give an imido complex.







Abstract
A series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of the general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N3N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;, L=THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene=C10H82&#8722;, C14H102&#8722;) mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N3N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of tert&#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand.

         <title>A Ratiometric Fluorescent Biosensor Reveals Dynamic Regulation of Long&#8208;Chain Fatty Acyl&#8208;CoA Esters Metabolism</title>

LACSer, a genetically encoded long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA fluorescence sensor, generates a specific fluorescence response to long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA, and can be used for the ratiometric quantification of long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA in cells and subcellular structures. The effects of ACSL and ACBP on the biosynthesis, transport, and downstream metabolism of long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA can be studied.







Abstract
Despite increasing awareness of the biological impacts of long&#8208;chain fatty acyl&#8208;CoA esters (LCACoAs), our knowledge about the subcellular distribution and regulatory functions of these acyl&#8208;CoA molecules is limited by a lack of methods for detecting LCACoAs in living cells. Here, we report development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that enables ratiometric quantification of LCACoAs in living cells and subcellular compartments. We demonstrate how this FadR&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;LACSer sensor&#8221; undergoes LCACoA&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in easily detectable fluorescence responses, and show proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for real&#8208;time monitoring of LCACoAs in human cells. Subsequently, we applied LACSer in scientific studies investigating how disruption of ACSL enzymes differentially reduces cytosolic and mitochondrial LCACoA levels, and show how genetic disruption of an acyl&#8208;CoA binding protein (ACBP) alters mitochondrial accumulation of LCACoAs.

         <title>Tuneable Control of Organocatalytic Activity through Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry</title>

Binding an organocatalyst inside a cucurbituril molecular host can reversibly up&#8208; or downregulate catalytic activity, which is demonstrated in temporal control over the rate of a range of organocatalyzed transformations.







Abstract
Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks, such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. We present a host&#8208;guest chemistry strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. In most cases CB[7] encapsulation results in catalyst inhibition, however in one case catalyst activation by binding to CB[7] was observed. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and pKa measurements. The catalytic activity can be instantaneously switched during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and the reaction rate can be predicted with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity.

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

TiO2@CaP nanosonosensitizer promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS). In an acidic tumor microenvironment, the CaP shell releases Ca2+ under ultrasound. The cascade process induces mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced immunogenic cell death to boost T cells recruitment and infiltration into the cold tumor, leading to regression of the primary tumor, non&#8208;treated distant tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis when in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy.







Abstract
Despite the promise of sonodynamic processes in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumors, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. We report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO2@CaP) that reinvigorates ROS generation and dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca2+ in an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO2@CaP acts as a smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca2+ ions to synergize with the sonodynamic process in the TME. TiO2@CaP substantially enhances immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T&#8208;cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO2@CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic antitumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work paves the way to development of &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizers with temporospatial control over antitumor responses.

&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin has dramatic consequences on the solution behaviour of molybdates. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis (SAXS) reveals the formation of large nanoscopic Mo&#8208;based oligomers that give rise to the fast formation of supramolecular core&#8211;shell type systems. This behaviour has been attributed to the chaotropic effect able to amplify very weak supramolecular interaction and then generates sophisticated non&#8208;covalent hierarchical assemblies.







Abstract
Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo154}&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8211;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re6Te8(CN)6]4&#8722; as exogenous guest. This seminal work brings better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly processes in general and gives new opportunities for practical applications in the design of complex multicomponent materials via the simplicity of the non&#8208;covalent chemistry.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Crystalline Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14124-14130, June 14, 2021. </description>

An unconventional ZIF&#8208;67 colloidal dispersion consisting of amorphous nanoparticles has been discovered, which was used as precursors to yield uniform films that deposited onto a number of substrates by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating approach, enabling fabrication of large&#8208;area ZIF&#8208;67 thin films with highly controlled thickness. This method can be extended to fabricate ZIF&#8208;8 thin film.







Abstract
We report that continuous MOF films with highly controlled thickness (from 44 to 5100&#8197;nm) can be deposited over length scales greater than 80&#8197;centimeters by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating method. Such success relies on our discovery of unprecedented perfectly dispersed colloidal solutions consisting of amorphous MOF nanoparticles, which we adopted as precursors that readily converted to the crystalline films upon low&#8208;temperature in situ heating. The colloidal solutions allow for the fabrication of compact and uniform MOF films on a great deal of substrates such as fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide, glass, SiO2, Al2O3, Si, Cu, and even flexible polycarbonate, widening their technological applications where substrates are essential. Despite the present work focuses on the fabrication of uniform cobalt&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 and zinc&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 films, our findings mark a great possibility in producing other high&#8208;quality MOF thin films on a large scale.

         <title>Coating the Right Polymer: Achieving Ideal Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Particle Dispersibility in Polymer Matrixes Using a Coordinative Crosslinking Surface Modification Method</title>

A new general method for the coating of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with a uniform layer of polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, or polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1) is reported. By matching the surface polymer with the matrix polymer, ideal dispersibility of MOF particles in various polymer matrices can thus be achieved.







Abstract
This work describes the first generalizable method to modify various metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1). The method first utilizes electrostatic adsorption to rapidly decorate positively charged MOF surfaces with a layer of negatively charged metal&#8208;organic nanocapsule, PgC5Cu. After mixing with the polymer, the copper open metal sites on PgC5Cu can coordinatively crosslink the polar functional groups on the surface polymer upon thermal activation thereby resulting in the immobilization of a uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm polymer coating. We quantitatively analyzed the distribution of free path spacing between MOF particles and demonstrated that when the surface polymer matches the matrix polymer, the MOF dispersion was not only visually improved but also found to align perfectly with a theoretically predicted ideal dispersion model where no aggregation driving force was present.

A three&#8208;step method produces COF aerogel monoliths, based on sol&#8211;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The aerogels have extremely low densities, high porosity, and mechanically behave as elastic or plastic materials under different strain. They show excellent absorption capacity with high removal efficiency.







Abstract
The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (ca. 0.02&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3), high porosity (total porosity values of ca. 99&#8201;%), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt;25&#8211;35&#8201;%) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (e.g. toluene uptake: 32&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1), with high removal efficiency (ca. 99&#8201;%). The same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Palladium(II) Barrel for Binding of Fullerenes and Photosensitization Ability of the Fullerene&#8208;Encapsulated Barrel</title>

A 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;based tetra&#8208;imidazole ligand and a PdII acceptor were employed to construct a trifacial molecular barrel (1), which acts as an efficient host for fullerenes. The barrel has better binding affinity towards C70 over C60 and predominantly encapsulates C70 from a mixture of C60/C70. In the presence of visible light, C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 show efficient photosensitizing ability for 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Fullerene extracts obtained from fullerene soot lack their real application due to their poor solubility in common solvents and difficulty in purification. Encapsulation of these extracts in a suitable host is an important approach to address these issues. We present a new Pd6 barrel (1), which is composed of three 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole panels, clipped through six cis&#8208;PdII acceptors. Large open windows and cavity make it an efficient host for a large guest. Favorable interactions between the ligand and fullerene (C60 and C70) allows the barrel to encapsulate fullerene efficiently. Thorough investigation reveals that barrel 1 has a stronger binding affinity towards C70 over C60, resulting in the predominant extraction of C70 from a mixture of the two. Finally, the fullerene encapsulated barrels C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 were found to be efficient for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced singlet oxygen generation. Such preferential binding of C70 and photosensitizing ability of C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 are noteworthy.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13978-13987, June 14, 2021. </description>

A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer was prepared that is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous encapsulation strategy.







Abstract
In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid polymer containing siloxyl functional groups was synthesized and applied to encapsulate phase change materials (PCMs). Owing to the mild conditions of the hypercrosslinking reaction, which only requires the addition of a catalytic amount of aqueous alkaline solution, both organic and inorganic PCMs are tolerated. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate encapsulation rate of the PCMs and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid hydrophobic polymer in a phase change composite endows the latter with a unique self&#8208;cleaning property. This novel PCM encapsulation protocol is suitable for nanoparticles including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles, and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. A thermal conductivity enhancement of 600&#8201;% was achieved along with 93.7&#8201;% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1 without leakage.

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

A dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom dispersed catalyst of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 has been established for enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Operando XANES combined with DFT calculation demonstrate that the Cu&#8722;N4 sites as active center experience the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turn to single&#8208;atom state again after reaction.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8722;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an Eonset of 0.98&#8197;V and an E1/2 of 0.83&#8197;V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8722;N4 as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.

Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the oxidation of olefins to ketones using either tris(dibenzoylmethanato)iron(III) [Fe(dbm)3] or a combination of iron(II) chloride and neocuproine (2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) as catalysts and phenylsilane (PhSiH3) as additive. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature using air as sole oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, is operationally simple, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and shows a high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ketones are formed smoothly in up to 97&#8201;% yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity, while the corresponding alcohols were observed as by&#8208;products. Labeling experiments showed that an incorporated hydrogen atom originates from the phenylsilane. The oxygen atom of the ketone as well as of the alcohol derives from the ambient atmosphere.

&lt;p&gt;Various iron catalyst systems featuring a range of different ligands have been evaluated for the Wacker-type oxidation of olefins to ketones in the presence of phenylsilane at room temperature and ambient air. The transformation is operationally simple, sustainable, exhibits a high functional group tolerance, and is applicable to natural product synthesis.

         <title>Dual Gate&#8208;Controlled Therapeutics for Overcoming Bacterium&#8208;Induced Drug Resistance and Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

pH/enzyme&#8208;responsive nanoreservoirs are co&#8208;loaded with anticancer drugs and antibiotics for overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance. They can effectively inhibit tumor growth and remarkably activate the immune system in the presence of bacteria. This work presents a safe and efficacious method to reverse bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and convert the intratumoral bacteria from foes to friends for cancer therapy.







Abstract
The presence of bacteria in the tumor can cause cancer resistance to chemotherapeutics. To fight against bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance, herein we design self&#8208;traceable nanoreservoirs that are simultaneously loaded with gemcitabine (an anticancer drug) and ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) and are decorated with hyaluronic acid for active tumor targeting. The nanoreservoirs have a pH&#8208;sensitive gate and an enzyme&#8208;responsive gate that can be opened in the acidic and hyaluronidase&#8208;abundant tumor microenvironment to control drug release rates. Moreover, the nanoreservoirs can specifically target the tumor regions without eliciting evident toxicity to normal tissues, kill the intratumoral bacteria, and inhibit the tumor growth even in the presence of the bacteria. Unexpectedly, the nanoreservoirs can activate T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses through promoting antigen&#8208;presenting dendritic cell maturation and depleting immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells in bacterium&#8208;infected tumors.

         <title>Efficient Nitrogen Fixation to Ammonia through Integration of Plasma Oxidation with Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14131-14137, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step process, serially integrating non&#8208;thermal plasma technique for facile N2 to NOx&#8722; and electrocatalytic reduction for highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3, is presented. A surface boron&#8208;rich nickel boride electrocatalyst was developed to boost the activity, selectivity, and stability for nitrate reduction to NH3 with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and low overpotential.







Abstract
Present one&#8208;step N2 fixation is impeded by tough activation of the N&#8801;N bond and low selectivity to NH3. Here we report fixation of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 can be decoupled to a two&#8208;step process with one problem effectively solved in each step, including: 1)&#8197;facile activation of N2 to NOx&#8722; by a non&#8208;thermal plasma technique, and 2)&#8197;highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3 by electrocatalytic reduction. Importantly, this process uses air and water as low&#8208;cost raw materials for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions. For NOx&#8722; reduction to NH3, we present a surface boron&#8208;rich core&#8211;shell nickel boride electrocatalyst. The surface boron&#8208;rich feature is the key to boosting activity, selectivity, and stability via enhanced NOx&#8722; adsorption, and suppression of hydrogen evolution and surface Ni oxidation. A significant ammonia production of 198.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, together with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Alcohol Dehydrogenases and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Catalysts: Design of a Chemoenzymatic Cascade towards Optically Active &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13945-13951, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concurrent process involving a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (IPrAuNTf2) and an alcohol dehydrogenase is described for the first time. This cascade approach allows the development of a Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement for the transformation of racemic propargylic alcohols, mostly with good selectivities towards the corresponding E&#8208;allylic ketone intermediates, in aqueous medium, which are subsequently reduced to obtain the desired alcohol enantiomers with excellent optical purities.







Abstract
The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis is used in a two&#8208;step approach, including Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of a series of readily available propargylic alcohols followed by stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, to provide optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. This cascade involves a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. The combination of [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2) and a selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH&#8208;A from Rhodococcus&#8197;ruber, KRED&#8208;P1&#8208;A12 or KRED&#8208;P3&#8208;G09) led to the synthesis of a series of optically active (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ols in good yields (65&#8211;86&#8201;%). The approach was also extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol, and butynol derivatives. The use of alcohol dehydrogenases of opposite selectivity led to the production of both allyl alcohol enantiomers (93&#8208;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) for a broad panel of substrates.

         <title>Rational Design of Multicolor&#8208;Emitting Chiral Carbonized Polymer Dots for Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14091-14099, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) is reported for the first time. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs is between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Furthermore, these Ch&#8208;CPDs were combined with chiral gels through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby yielding their multicolor and white circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) are attracting great interest because of their extraordinary photonic properties, but modulating their band&#8208;gap emission, especially at long wavelength, and maintaining their chiral structure to achieve multicolor, high&#8208;emission Ch&#8208;CPDs remains challenging.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of red- and multicolor-emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch-CPDs) is reported for the first time. The quantum yield of the Ch-CPDs is between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Furthermore, these Ch-CPDs were combined with chiral gels through supramolecular self-assembly, thereby yielding their multicolor and white circularly polarized luminescence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch-CPDs) are attracting great interest because of their extraordinary photonic properties, but modulating their band-gap emission, especially at long wavelength, and maintaining their chiral structure to achieve multicolor, high-emission Ch-CPDs remains challenging. Reported here for the first time is the synthesis of red- and multicolor-emitting Ch-CPDs using the common precursors &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-/&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-tryptophan and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine, and a solvothermal approach at one temperature. The quantum yield of the Ch-CPDs was between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Supramolecular self-assembly provided multicolor-emitting Ch-CPDs showing novel circularly polarized luminescence, with the highest dissymmetric factor (g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Importantly, circularly polarized white-emitting CPDs were fabricated for the first time by tuning the mixing ratio of the three colored Ch-CPDs in a gel. This strategy affords exciting opportunities for designing functional chiroptical materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>

A strategy is presented for nickel&#8208; catalyzed asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides react to produce oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Notably, synthesis of a range of bioactive pyrroloindolines was achieved.







Abstract
Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO2 is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO2 fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. There are only a few reports and no examples of alkenes via transition metal catalysis. We report the first asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 via nickel catalysis. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides, such as aryl bromides, aryl triflates and inert aryl chlorides of particular note, undergo the reaction smoothly to give important oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. This transformation features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, facile scalability, good to excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The method highlights the formal synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Esermethole, (&#8722;)&#8208;Physostigmine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Physovenine, and the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Debromoflustramide&#8197;B, (&#8722;)&#8208;Debromoflustramine&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;Coixspirolactam&#8197;A; thereby, opening an avenue for the total synthesis of chiral natural products with CO2.

         <title>Generating Assembled MFI Nanocrystals with Reduced b&#8208;Axis through Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Exchange Induced Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13959-13968, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned plate&#8208;shaped MFI crystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness were synthesized through homogeneous nucleation followed by structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) exchange induced recrystallization, using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The obtained materials markedly exaggerated propene selectivity and showed prolonged catalyst lifetime in the conversion of dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
Controlling crystal size and shape of zeolitic materials is an effective way to promote their mass transport and catalytic properties. Herein, we report a single step, Na+&#8208; and porogen&#8208; free crystallization of MFI hierarchical architecture made up of aligned nanocrystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness (5&#8211;23&#8197;nm) and adjustable Si/Al ratios between 35 to 120, employing the commonly used tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Homogeneous nucleation driven by both SDAs and subsequent SDA&#8208;exchange induced dissolution&#8208;recrystallization are responsible for the formation of such structure. The enhanced textural and diffusion properties account for a notable exaggeration of propene selectivity and catalyst lifetime in dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (DTO) conversion. This protocol is extendable to the rational synthesis of other hierarchical zeolites through crystallization process control.

         <title>The Hydrotropic Effect of Ionic Liquids in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolytes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids boost the LiTFSI solubility in water from 21 to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Excess lithium salt solubility arises from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. This approach improves particularly the reductive stability of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes, enabling stable cycling of commercially relevant LTO/NMC811 full cells.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#8197;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in water to up to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.

         <title>Effect of the Ligand Backbone on the Reactivity and Mechanistic Paradigm of Non&#8208;Heme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo during Olefin Epoxidation</title>

The steric and electronic effects exerted by the bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) in the non&#8208;heme complex [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ play a key role in olefin epoxidation by oxygen atom transfer and trigger mechanistic diversification. In the present study, the mechanism of olefin epoxidation was thoroughly investigated and rationalized with a detailed computational study.







Abstract
The oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity of the non&#8208;heme [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ (2) containing the sterically bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) has been thoroughly studied with different olefins. The ferryl&#8208;oxo complex 2 shows excellent OAT reactivity during epoxidations. The steric encumbrance and electronic effect of the ligand influence the mechanistic shuttle between OAT pathway I and isomerization pathway II (during the reaction stereo pure olefins), resulting in a mixture of cis&#8208;trans epoxide products. In contrast, the sterically less hindered and electronically different [FeIV(N4Py)(O)]2+ (1) provides only cis&#8208;stilbene epoxide. A Hammett study suggests the role of dominant inductive electronic along with minor resonance effect during electron transfer from olefin to 2 in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Additionally, a computational study supports the involvement of stepwise pathways during olefin epoxidation. The ferryl bend due to the bulkier ligand incorporation leads to destabilization of both 
 and 
 orbitals, leading to a very small quintet&#8211;triplet gap and enhanced reactivity for 2 compared to 1. Thus, the present study unveils the role of steric and electronic effects of the ligand towards mechanistic modification during olefin epoxidation

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity of the non-heme [Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(2PyN2Q)(O)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) containing the sterically bulky quinoline-pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) has been thoroughly studied with different olefins. The ferryl-oxo complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; shows excellent OAT reactivity during epoxidations. The steric encumbrance and electronic effect of the ligand influence the mechanistic shuttle between OAT pathway I and isomerization pathway II (during the reaction stereo pure olefins), resulting in a mixture of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; epoxide products. In contrast, the sterically less hindered and electronically different [Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(N4Py)(O)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) provides only &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-stilbene epoxide. A Hammett study suggests the role of dominant inductive electronic along with minor resonance effect during electron transfer from olefin to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in the rate-limiting step. Additionally, a computational study supports the involvement of stepwise pathways during olefin epoxidation. The ferryl bend due to the bulkier ligand incorporation leads to destabilization of both 
 and 
 orbitals, leading to a very small quintet&#8211;triplet gap and enhanced reactivity for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; compared to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Thus, the present study unveils the role of steric and electronic effects of the ligand towards mechanistic modification during olefin epoxidation&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cooperation between a T&#8197;Domain and a Minimal C&#8208;Terminal Docking Domain to Enable Specific Assembly in a Multiprotein NRPS</title>

         <dc:description>
The interaction between two non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) proteins mediates the biosynthesis of PAX peptides and involves an extended docking interface, where a part of the thiolation (T) domain and a minimal C&#8208;terminal docking domain (CDD) cooperate to bind to the N&#8208;terminal docking domain (NDD) with nanomolar affinity&#8212;the highest docking domain affinity yet observed in such megasynthases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products from amino acid building blocks. They often consist of multiple polypeptide chains which assemble in a specific linear order via specialized N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal docking domains (N/CDDs). Typically, docking domains function independently from other domains in NRPS assembly. Thus, docking domain replacements enable the assembly of &#8220;designer&#8221; NRPS from proteins that normally do not interact. The multiprotein &#8220;peptide&#8208;antimicrobial&#8208;Xenorhabdus&#8221; (PAX) peptide&#8208;producing PaxS NRPS is assembled from the three proteins PaxA, PaxB and PaxC. Herein, we show that the small CDD of PaxA cooperates with its preceding thiolation (T1) domain to bind the NDD of PaxB with very high affinity, establishing a structural and thermodynamical basis for this unprecedented docking interaction, and we test its functional importance in vivo in a truncated PaxS assembly line. Similar docking interactions are apparently present in other NRPS systems.

         <title>Catalytic Oxygenation of Hydrocarbons by Mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo Dicopper(II) Species Resulting from O&#8722;O Cleavage of Tetranuclear CuI/CuII Peroxo Complexes</title>

UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopies complemented by XAS and UHR&#8208;ESI mass spectrometry are employed to monitor the binding of O2 in a tetranuclear copper cluster, followed by homolytic O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The resulting mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper(II) complexes catalytically oxygenate a variety of hydrocarbons, establishing an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the monooxygenation of organic substrates from gaseous O2.







Abstract
One of the challenges of catalysis is the transformation of inert C&#8722;H bonds to useful products. Copper&#8208;containing monooxygenases play an important role in this regard. Here we show that low&#8208;temperature oxygenation of dinuclear copper(I) complexes leads to unusual tetranuclear, mixed&#8208;valent &#956;4&#8208;peroxo [CuI/CuII]2 complexes. These Cu4O2 intermediates promote irreversible and thermally activated O&#8722;O bond homolysis, generating Cu2O complexes that catalyze strongly exergonic H&#8208;atom abstraction from hydrocarbons, coupled to O&#8208;transfer. The Cu2O species can also be produced with N2O, demonstrating their capability for small&#8208;molecule activation. The binding and cleavage of O2 leading to the primary Cu4O2 intermediate and the Cu2O complexes, respectively, is elucidated with a range of solution spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The unique reactivities of these species establish an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the catalytic, copper&#8208;mediated monooxygenation of organic substrates, employing both O&#8208;atoms of O2.

         <title>Tunable Hydrophobicity via Dimensionally Confined Polymerization of Organometallic Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13929-13936, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By restricting polymerization in the native pores of pre&#8208;packed undercooled particles, organometallic adducts were autonomously generated on either flat&#8208; or pre&#8208;textured particle beds. These adducts&#8217; fine structures successfully turned the Wenzel wetting state of metal rose into the Cassie state of composite lotus.







Abstract
Fabrication of tunable fine textures on solid metal surfaces often demands sophisticated reaction/processing systems. By exploiting in&#8197;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of inorganic adducts derived from liquid metals (the so&#8208;called HetMet reaction) with concomitant solidification, solid metal films with tunable texture are readily fabricated. Serving as a natural dimensional confinement, interparticle pores and capillary&#8208;adhered thin liquid films in a pre&#8208;packed bed of undercooled liquid metal particles lead to the expeditious surface accumulation of organometallic synthons, which readily oligomerize and self&#8208;assemble into concentration&#8208;dictated morphologies/patterns. Tuning particle size, particle packing (flat or textured), and reactant concentration generates diverse, autonomously organized organometallic structures on a metal particle bed. Concomitant solidification and sintering of the underlying undercooled particle bed led to a multiscale patterned solid metal surface. The process is illustrated by creating tunable features on pre&#8208;organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so&#8208;called petal and lotus effects.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Pairing Approach to Stereoselective Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>

Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is achieved by non&#8208;covalent interactions, such as ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics and solvation effects, in a metal&#8208;free condition.







Abstract
Stereochemistry can have a profound impact on polymer and materials properties. Unfortunately, straightforward methods for realizing high levels of stereocontrolled polymerizations are often challenging to achieve. In a departure from traditional metal&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), we discovered a remarkably simple method for controlling alkene stereochemistry in photoredox mediated metal&#8208;free ROMP. Ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics, and solvation effects each had profound impact on the stereochemistry of polynorbornene (PNB). Simple modifications to the reaction conditions produced PNB with trans alkene content of 25 to &gt;98&#8201;%. High cis content was obtained from relatively larger counterions, toluene as solvent, low temperatures (&#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C), and initiators with low Charton values. Conversely, smaller counterions, dichloromethane as solvent, and enol ethers with higher Charton values enabled production of PNB with high trans content. Data from a combined experimental and computational investigation are consistent with the stereocontrolling step of the radical cationic mechanism proceeding under thermodynamic control.

We report the isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold. The absolute configurations and antibacterial activities of benditerpenoic acid and the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene core were established.







Abstract
A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this Streptomyces strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher's analysis, J&#8208;based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR&#8208;derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring&#8208;flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of &#8776;16&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including methicillin and multi&#8208;drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is a rare example of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheet Mimetics that Target the Transcriptional Coactivator &#946;&#8208;Catenin and Inhibit Wnt Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13937-13944, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a 52 amino acid protein binding epitope, a bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin structure was developed to bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. Our structure&#8208;based design approach was supported by screening a focused library of bicyclic mimetics which was generated via late&#8208;stage diversification. The most active bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin shows cell&#8208;penetration and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.

Methyl&#8208;group NMR spectroscopy offers exceptional benefits for structural studies of complex biological systems. Yet, restrictive isotope labeling requirements have obstructed its use in emerging protein expression systems. In their Communication on page&#8197;13783, Manuel Etzkorn, Vladimir Gelev, Haribabu Arthanari, and co&#8208;workers report a five&#8208;step synthesis of stereoselectively methyl&#8208;labeled leucine, which greatly facilitates applications in eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems, providing desirable NMR sensors in so far inaccessible protein systems.

Bicyclic peptidomimetics bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. A structure&#8208;based design strategy has been applied to minimize a 52 amino acid binding motif into bicyclic 16&#8208;mer &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics. The biologically most active mimetic exhibits robust cellular uptake and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay, as reported by Tom&#8197;N. Grossmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;13937.

Zeolite catalysts often display highly intergrown structures, yielding a zeolite &#8220;flower&#8221; or &#8220;sun&#8221; at the microscale. Using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in&#8197;situ fluorescence microscopy, Bert&#8197;M. Weckhuysen et&#8197;al. show in their Communication on page&#8197;13803 that porosity is developed only in specific segments of zeolites, which might cause strong local discrepancies in performance and deactivation behavior. The yellow sun against a black background is reminiscent of the symbol of Utrecht University, where the work was performed.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site&#8208;Selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13757-13777, June 14, 2021. </description>

Site&#8208;selective dual protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates. The methodologies, as well as the applications of dual&#8208;functionalized protein bioconjugates are highlighted in this review.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates such as traceable therapeutics with improved features. Dual functionalization of proteins allows the incorporation of two different types of functionalities at distinct location(s), which greatly expands the features of native proteins. The attachment and crosstalk of a fluorescence donor and an acceptor dye provides fundamental insights into the folding and structural changes of proteins upon ligand binding in their native cellular environments. Moreover, the combination of drug molecules with different modes of action, imaging agents or stabilizing polymers provides new avenues to design precision protein therapeutics in a reproducible and well&#8208;characterizable fashion. This review aims to give a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this relatively new research area. First, the chemical toolbox for dual functionalization of proteins is discussed and compared. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual&#8208;modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.

Made for each other! Striking similarity in reactivity has been observed for organocatalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums towards various nucleophiles. Analogous [3+3] and [3+2] annulations, cascade reactions, and Michael additions of these highly electrophilic intermediates are highlighted in this Minireview.







Abstract
The secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed reactions proceeding via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed transformations taking place via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums are the two widely used electrophilic intermediates in organocatalysis. Over the last two decades, these two intermediates are extensively utilized for the enantioselective construction of valuable molecules. Both intermediates are generated by the covalent binding of catalysts to the substrates leading to LUMO activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. A variety of soft nucleophiles are known to add to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums in a conjugate fashion, and in many cases, striking similarity in reactivity has been observed. Having said this, there are few cases where these intermediates exhibit difference in reactivity. This Minireview is aimed at highlighting the resemblances in reactivity between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums thereby shedding light on the unnoticed parallels of the two intermediates in organocatalysis.

         <title>Nitro and Other Electron Withdrawing Group Activated Ruthenium Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13738-13756, June 14, 2021. </description>

Chelating&#8208;benzylidene ruthenium complexes (so&#8208;called Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalysts) activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs) are finding practical applications in target&#8208;oriented synthesis, medicinal chemistry, the preparation of fine&#8208;chemicals, and in materials chemistry.







Abstract
Advanced applications of the Nobel Prize winning olefin metathesis reaction require user&#8208;friendly and highly universal catalysts. From many successful metathesis catalysts, which belong to the two distinct classes of Schrock and Grubbs&#8208;type catalysts, the subclass of chelating&#8208;benzylidene ruthenium complexes (so&#8208;called Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalysts) additionally activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs) provides a highly tunable platform. In the Review, the origin of the EWG&#8208;activation concept and selected applications of the resulting catalysts in target&#8208;oriented synthesis, medicinal chemistry, as well as in the preparation of fine&#8208;chemicals and in materials chemistry is discussed. Based on the examples, some suggestions for end&#8208;users regarding minimization of catalyst loading, selectivity control, and general optimization of the olefin metathesis reaction are provided.

         <title>Dynamic Polymer Networks: A New Avenue towards Sustainable and Advanced Soft Machines</title>

Polymer networks cross&#8208;linked through bonds capable of exchanging with one another have a high potential for increasing the sustainability of polymeric materials. However, the adaptive and responsive properties of these networks can also enhance the properties of electroactive polymers in smart and functional devices. This Minireview highlights recent work at this emerging research boundary and discusses future directions for dynamic polymer networks in soft machine applications.







Abstract
While the fascinating field of soft machines has grown rapidly over the last two decades, the materials they are constructed from have remained largely unchanged during this time. Parallel activities have led to significant advances in the field of dynamic polymer networks, leading to the design of three&#8208;dimensionally cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials that are able to adapt and transform through stimuli&#8208;induced bond exchange. Recent work has begun to merge these two fields of research by incorporating the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of dynamic polymer networks into soft machine components. These include dielectric elastomers, stretchable electrodes, nanogenerators, and energy storage devices. In this Minireview, we outline recent progress made in this emerging research area and discuss future directions for the field.

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13788-13792, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to syngas mediated by single Rh atom&#8208;doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO2&#8722;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the COads from RhTiO2CO&#8722;.







Abstract
Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H2+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722; promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of COads from the RhTiO2CO&#8722; to reform RhTiO2&#8722;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.

         <title>An Ultralow Temperature Aqueous Battery with Proton Chemistry</title>

An aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on H+ coordination/un&#8208;coordination behavior was developed in anti&#8208;freezing H2SO4 solution. The batteries can work well even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C due to the fast H+ diffusion kinetics and high ionic conductivity of electrolyte.







Abstract
Conventional aqueous batteries usually suffer from serious capacity loss under subzero conditions owing to the freeze of electrolytes. To realize the utilization of aqueous batteries in extremely cold climates, low&#8208;temperature aqueous battery systems have to be developed. Herein, an aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on p&#8208;chloranil/reduced graphene oxide (PCHL&#8208;rGO) in H2SO4 electrolyte is developed. Such aqueous Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries display H+ insertion chemistry, which endows the batteries with fast reaction kinetics and high rate capability. In addition, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be significantly damaged in electrolyte by modulating the interaction between SO42&#8722; and water molecules, lowering the freezing point of electrolyte. As a result, the Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries deliver extraordinary electrochemical performance even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This work will broaden the horizons of aqueous batteries and open up new opportunities to construct low&#8208;temperature aqueous batteries.

         <title>Silylated Sulfuric Acid: Preparation of a Tris(trimethylsilyl)oxosulfonium [(Me3Si&#8722;O)3SO]+ Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13798-13802, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;larger&#8221; analog of protonated sulfuric acid, [H3SO4]+, the silylated oxosulfonium ion, [(Me3Si)3SO4]+, was obtained in the reaction of silylated sulfuric acid with a [Me3Si]+ transfer reagent such as [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3]+[wca]&#8722;, when a weakly coordinating anion ([wca]&#8722;) is used as counterion.







Abstract
The chemistry of silylated sulfuric acid, O2S(OSiMe3)2 (T2SO4, T=Me3Si; also known as bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfate), has been studied in detail with the aim of synthesizing the formal autosilylation products of silylated sulfuric acid, [T3SO4]+ and [TSO4]&#8722;, in analogy to the known protonated species, [H3SO4]+ and [HSO4]&#8722;. The synthesis of the [TSO4]&#8722; ion only succeeds when a base, such as OPMe3 that forms a weakly coordinating cation upon silylation, is reacted with T2SO4, resulting in the formation of [Me3POT]+[TSO4]&#8722;. [T3SO4]+ salts could be isolated starting from T2SO4 in the reaction with [T&#8722;H&#8722;T]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or T+[CHB11Br6H5]&#8722; when a weakly coordinating anion is used as counterion. All silylated compounds could be crystallized and structurally characterized.

         <title>Separation&#8208;Controlled Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13892-13895, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox reactions are quite difficult to control because their reaction equilibrium constants strongly depart from unity (particularly if at least one of the reactants is a potent oxidizing or reducing agent). Based on calculations, smooth control of charge transfer depending solely on the separation between oxidizer and reductant is proposed. AgF2, a powerful oxidizer, may be electron&#8208;doped to a controlled extent using this approach.







Abstract
In the era of molecular devices and nanotechnology, precise control over electron&#8208;transfer processes is strongly desired. However, redox reactions are usually characterized by reaction equilibrium constants strongly departing from unity. This leads to strong favoring of either reactants or products and does not permit subtle control of transferred charge (doping). Here we propose, based on theoretical studies for periodic systems, how charge transfer between reactants could be finely manipulated in the epitaxially grown system composed of extremely strong oxidizer, reducing agent, and an inert separator&#8212;the key factor of control.

The synthesis of the hitherto unknown peri&#8208;heptacene 7&#8208;PA is demonstrated by a rational molecular design strategy in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. The open&#8208;shell 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits a persistent stability (half&#8208;life &#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions.







Abstract
n&#8208;peri&#8208;Acenes (n&#8208;PAs) have gained interest as model systems of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons for potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. However, the synthesis of n&#8208;PAs larger than peri&#8208;tetracene remains challenging because of their intrinsic open&#8208;shell character and high reactivity. Presented here is the synthesis of a hitherto unknown n&#8208;PA, that is, peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA), in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected with eight 4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4 groups. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits persistent stability (t1/2&#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions. Moreover, electron&#8208;spin resonance measurements and theoretical studies reveal that 7&#8208;PA exhibits an open&#8208;shell feature and a significant tetraradical character. This strategy could be considered a modular approach for the construction of next&#8208;generation (3&#8201;N+1)&#8208;PAs (where N&#8805;3).

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13803-13806, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical porosity within a zeolite crystal is visualized by X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy to probe nanoporosity within the inorganic zeolite phase. In complement, in situ fluorescence microscopy allows to monitor pore hierarchization in real&#8208;time via organic fluorescent stains, which fill the meso&#8208; and macropore space.







Abstract
Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (in situ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by in situ fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core via a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.

         <title>Local Deuteration Enables NMR Observation of Methyl Groups in Proteins from Eukaryotic and Cell&#8208;Free Expression Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13783-13787, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;based magnetization usage can strongly benefit investigations of large protein systems via NMR spectroscopy. Here, a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to obtain locally deuterated leucine suitable for methyl NMR and to quantify its benefits is presented. The approach substantially expands the applicability of methyl labeling in emerging expression systems including cell&#8208;free and eukaryotic systems.







Abstract
Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective 13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8220;local&#8221; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.

         <title>E. coli Nickel&#8208;Iron Hydrogenase 1 Catalyses Non&#8208;native Reduction of Flavins: Demonstration for Alkene Hydrogenation by Old Yellow Enzyme Ene&#8208;reductases**

Robust [NiFe] hydrogenase 1 (Hyd1) from Escherichia coli is shown to have non&#8208;native, H2&#8208;dependent activity for FMN and FAD reduction. It is a promising recycling system for FMNH2 or FADH2 supply to flavoenzymes for chemical synthesis when coupled with an Old Yellow Enzyme ene&#8208;reductase.







Abstract
A new activity for the [NiFe] uptake hydrogenase&#8197;1 of Escherichia coli (Hyd1) is presented. Direct reduction of biological flavin cofactors FMN and FAD is achieved using H2 as a simple, completely atom&#8208;economical reductant. The robust nature of Hyd1 is exploited for flavin reduction across a broad range of temperatures (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C) and extended reaction times. The utility of this system as a simple, easy to implement FMNH2 or FADH2 regenerating system is then demonstrated by supplying reduced flavin to Old Yellow Enzyme &#8220;ene&#8208;reductases&#8221; to support asymmetric alkene reductions with up to 100&#8201;% conversion. Hyd1 turnover frequencies up to 20.4&#8197;min&#8722;1 and total turnover numbers up to 20&#8201;200 were recorded during flavin recycling.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Giant Conjugated Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13896-13899, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant conjugated macrocycles with a diameter of roughly 7&#8197;nm consisting of up to 30 subunits were synthesized on a Ag(111) surface in a two&#8208;step reaction. Site&#8208;selective debromination initiated the synthesis, resulting in arched covalent oligomers and macrocycles, which were assisted by C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits. The subsequent cyclodehydrogenation steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles.







Abstract
We have achieved an on&#8208;surface synthesis of giant conjugated macrocycles having a diameter of &#8776;7&#8197;nm and consisting of up to 30 subunits. The synthesis started with a debrominative coupling of the molecular precursors on a hot Ag(111) surface, leading to the formation of arched oligomeric chains and macrocycles. These products were revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density functional theory to be covalent oligomers. These intermediates also display C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits due to site&#8208;selective debromination and the asymmetric molecular conformation. Subsequent cyclodehydrogenation at higher temperatures steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles. Our findings provide a novel design strategy toward &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and open up new opportunities for the precise synthesis of organic nanostructures.

Prepare for trouble&#8212;and make it double: A organoselenium&#8208;catalysed, regiospecific para&#8208;hydroxylation starting from N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids through double [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to form para&#8208;aminophenols was developed. This operationally easy reaction delivers useful para&#8208;aminophenol building blocks on small and large scales and its mechanism is supported through quantum chemical calculations as well as labeling experiments.







Abstract
A selenium&#8208;catalysed para&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acids is reported. Mechanistically, the reaction comprises an N&#8722;O bond cleavage and consecutive selenium&#8208;induced [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to deliver para&#8208;hydroxyaniline derivatives. The mechanism is studied through both 18O&#8208;crossover experiments as well as quantum chemical calculations. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation provides an unconventional synthetic approach to para&#8208;aminophenols.

An asymmetric multicomponent interrupted Kinugasa allylic alkylation (IKAA) reaction has been developed with a synergistic Cu&#8208;catalyzed Kinugasa and Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation system. This strategy provides a high yield and highly selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams, which are not easily produced by other methods. Stereoselective coupling of two transient organometallic intermediates formed in&#8197;situ is the most important feature of this reaction.







Abstract
An asymmetric multicomponent, interrupted Kinugasa allylic alkylation (IKAA) reaction has been developed with a synergistic Cu&#8208;catalyzed Kinugasa system and a Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. This unprecedented reaction provides in high yields and with high stereoselectivity a synthesis of &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams, which cannot be produced with existing synthetic methods. Stereoselective coupling of two catalytic amounts of transient organometallic intermediates formed in&#8197;situ is an important feature of this reaction.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Polyimide&#8208;Graphene Heterostructure with Ultra&#8208;fast Interlayer Charge Transfer</title>

We demonstrate a general but reliable on&#8208;water synthesis and assembly strategy toward the preparation of 2D polyimide (2DPI)&#8208;graphene (G) van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) on water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (ca. 60&#8197;fs) after protonation in the heterostructure, which is among the fastest reports of vdWHs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) are a class of atomically/molecularly thin crystalline organic 2D materials. They are intriguing candidates for the development of unprecedented organic&#8211;inorganic 2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with exotic physicochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of large&#8208;area (cm2), monolayer 2D polyimide (2DPI) with 3.1&#8208;nm lattice. Such 2DPI comprises metal&#8208;free porphyrin and perylene units linked by imide bonds. We further achieve a scalable synthesis of 2DPI&#8208;graphene (2DPI&#8208;G) vdWHs via a face&#8208;to&#8208;face co&#8208;assembly of graphene and 2DPI on the water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (ca. 60&#8197;fs) in the resultant 2DPI&#8208;G vdWH upon protonation by acid, which is equivalent to that of the fastest reports among inorganic 2D vdWHs. Such large interlayer electronic coupling is ascribed to the interlayer cation&#8211;&#960; interaction between 2DP and graphene.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Phosphonylation of Indoles at the C4 and C6 Positions by a Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13871-13876, June 14, 2021. </description>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote phosphonylation for the indole C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;positions was achieved by a radical approach. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H activation of indole benzenoid moiety has been achieved in the past decade. However, palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8722;H activation of indoles is rare. Herein, we report a challenging palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C4&#8208;H phosphonylation of indoles by a radical approach. The method provides access to a series of C4&#8208;phosphonylated indoles, including tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing dipeptides, which are typically inaccessible by direct C4&#8208;H activation due to its heavy reliance on C3 directing groups. Notably, unexpected C6&#8208;phosphonylated indoles were obtained through blocking of the C4 position. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process. Based on the strategy, examples of remote C4&#8208;H difluoromethylation with BrCF2COOEt are also presented, suggesting that the strategy may offer a general blueprint for other cross&#8208;couplings.

Abstract
Multiply bonded lanthanide oxo groups are rare in coordination compounds and have not previously been reported for a surface termination of a lanthanide oxide. Here we report the observation of a Ce=O terminated ceria surface in a CeO2(111)&#8208;(
&#215;
)R30&#176; reconstruction of &#8776;3&#8197;nm thick ceria islands prepared on Pt(111). This is evidenced by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A Ce=O stretching frequency of 775&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is observed in HREELS, compared with 766&#8197;cm&#8722;1 calculated by DFT. The calculations also predict that the Ce=O bond is weak, with an oxygen vacancy formation energy of 0.85&#8197;eV. This could play an important role in the facile removal of lattice oxygen from CeO2, accompanied by the reduction of CeIV to CeIII, which is a key attribute of ceria&#8208;based systems in connection with their unique catalytic properties.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;Vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13840-13846, June 14, 2021. </description>

Regenerative surface vacancies could be repeatedly created by external conditions like UV light irradiation. These regenerative surface vacancies can significantly improve the cycling stability and eventually realize both high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640&#8197;h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO.

&lt;p&gt;Regenerative surface vacancies could be repeatedly created by external conditions like UV light irradiation. These regenerative surface vacancies can significantly improve the cycling stability and eventually realize both high catalytic activity and long-term stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we first design a fast low-pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies. Taking the defective Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron-radiation quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O-defective Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate-limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O-defective Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640&#8197;h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for visible-light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversing the Chirality of Surface Ligands Can Improve the Biosafety and Pharmacokinetics of Cationic Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13829-13834, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improved biosafety and in vivo transportation of cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) are achieved by tuning the chirality of surface ligands. D&#8208;GNCs effectively shield the high toxicity induced by cationic ligands. Post&#8208;exposure to mice, renal&#8208;/hepatic&#8208;clearable D&#8208;GNCs also show superior in vivo performances in aspects of biological circulation and tumor accumulation.







Abstract
Severe toxicity and rapid in vivo clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and in vivo performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L&#8208;glutathione (L&#8208;GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D&#8208;counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L&#8208;GNCs, D&#8208;GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D&#8208;GNCs show less cell internalization than L&#8208;GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis. In vivo, the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D&#8208;/L&#8208;GNCs. D&#8208;GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly&#8208;sized and poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of 16&#960; Antiaromatic 2,7&#8208;Dihydrodiazapyrenes: Antiaromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons with Embedded Nitrogen</title>

N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;dihydrodiazapyrenes were synthesized and characterized. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with a pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and calculations confirmed the presence of a distinct paratropic ring current. N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;dihydrodiazapyrenes exhibit an antiaromatic character derived from their peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.







Abstract
We describe the two&#8208;electron reduction of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diazapyrenium dications (MDAP2+), which afforded the corresponding reduced form (MDAP0) as a highly electron&#8208;rich 16&#960; antiaromatic system. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of MDAP0 revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with high bond&#8208;length alternation. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum of MDAP0 exhibited a diagnostic proton signal (4.6&#8197;ppm) that is distinctly upfield shifted compared to that of aromatic diazapyrene (8.3&#8197;ppm). Theoretical calculations supported the existence of a paratropic ring current. These results indicate that MDAP0 exhibits antiaromatic character derived from its peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.

         <title>A Colorimetric Method for Quantifying Cis and Trans Alkenes Using an Indicator Displacement Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13819-13823, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput method was developed using a colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) to quantify the alkene stereochemistry present within mixtures to an accuracy of 2&#8211;3&#8201;%. Within a series of 96&#8208;well plates, alkenes were dihydroxylated and the resulting diols were subjected to an IDA with an indicator and a boronic acid to determine the amount of threo and/or erythro vicinal diols present.







Abstract
A colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation was developed to determine the percentage of cis and trans alkenes. Using 96&#8208;well plates two steps are performed: a reaction plate for dihydroxylation of the alkenes followed by an IDA screening plate consisting of an indicator and a boronic acid. The dihydroxylation generates either erythro or threo vicinal diols from cis or trans alkenes, depending upon their syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;addition mechanisms. Threo diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of cis and trans alkenes. Blind mixtures of cis and trans alkenes were made, resulting in an average error of &#177;2&#8201;% in the percentage of cis or trans alkenes, and implementing E2 and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177;3&#8201;%. Furthermore, we developed variants of the IDA for which the color may be tuned to optimize the response for the human eye.

Abstract
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. In the presence of a RhI catalyst with a chiral diphosphine ligand, a wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chiralities are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivities via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation. Absolute configuration analysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures revealed a novel silicon central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality relay phenomenon, which we believe will inspire further research in the field of asymmetric catalysis and chiroptical materials.

The first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation using a rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions is described in this paper. The dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex worked as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia and silylamine, where up to 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia and 11.7&#8197;equiv of silylamine were produced based on the Re atom of the catalyst.







Abstract
A series of rhenium complexes bearing a pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand are synthesized from rhenium phosphine complexes as precursors. A dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex bearing the PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands catalytically converts dinitrogen into ammonia during the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and [HPCy3]BArF4 (Cy=cyclohexyl, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) as a proton source at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to afford 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. The rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex also catalyzes silylation of dinitrogen in the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and Me3SiCl as a silylating reagent under ambient reaction conditions to afford 11.7&#8197;equiv of tris(trimethylsilyl)amine based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. These results demonstrate the first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions using rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complexes as catalysts.

         <title>Highly Coordinated Heteronuclear Calcium&#8211;Iron Carbonyl Cation Complexes [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) with d&#8722;d Bonding</title>

The [CaFe(CO)10]+ cation is characterized to be a coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 moiety through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. The complex is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8722;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond that is enhanced by the attraction between Ca and the bridging CO ligands.







Abstract
Heteronuclear calcium&#8211;iron carbonyl cation complexes in the form of [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) are produced in the gas phase. Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations confirm that the n=10 complex is the coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 fragment through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8594;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond in the [(CO)6Ca&#8211;Fe(CO)4]+ structure, which enriches the pool of experimentally observed complexes of calcium that mimic transition metal compounds. The molecule is the first example of a heteronuclear carbonyl complex featuring a d&#8722;d bond between calcium and a transition metal.

         <title>Substituted Dihydropyridine Synthesis by Dearomatization of Pyridines</title>

Metal&#8208;free dearomatization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful method to yield partially saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. Yet, the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we present a very mild and selective reduction of N&#8208;heteroarenes by amine borane to synthesize a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines.







Abstract
Dearomatization is an effective method to transform readily available N&#8208;heterocycles into partially saturated motifs. Manipulation of dihydro&#8208;derivatives holds great potential and provides access to a variety of semi&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. However, current strategies are limited in scope and the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we report the synthesis of a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines by very mild and selective reduction with amine borane for the first time.

         <title>A Double Deprotonation Strategy for Cascade Annulations of Palladium&#8211;Trimethylenemethanes and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Carbonates to Construct Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane Frameworks</title>

The palladium&#8211;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles can be chemoseletively generated from 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl)allyl carbonates via a deprotonation strategy, which allows the SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition to Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates from activated ketones. Cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations are followed to construct enantioenriched bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks with three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Here we report that the chemoselective activation of Tsuji's 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl)allyl carbonates to generate the palladium&#8211;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles via a deprotonation strategy can be realized in the presence of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates from substantial activated ketones. The following SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition enables the formation of new 1,3&#8208;dipole species having an activated alkene moiety through a second deprotonation process, which then undergo cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations to furnish complex bicyclic [3.1.0]hexane frameworks having three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers with good to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, by using benzoyl aldehyde&#8208;derived substrates, a [1+4]/[3+2] annulation sequence is similarly developed to produce fused cyclopenta[b]furan architectures.

The protein caveolin&#8208;1 was divided into five peptide segments for solid&#8208;phase synthesis. To improve the solubility of the triply palmitoylated C&#8208;terminal region, O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After ligation, introduction of the palmitoyl groups, and removal of the protecting groups, the isopeptide structures were converted into the native peptide bonds (see scheme). The obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into bicelles.







Abstract
Caveolin&#8208;1, which is an essential protein for caveola formation, was chemically synthesized. It is composed of 177 amino acid residues, is triply palmitoylated at the C&#8208;terminal region, and is inserted into the lipid bilayer to form a V&#8208;shaped structure in the middle of the polypeptide chain. The entire sequence was divided into five peptide segments, each of which was synthesized by the solid&#8208;phase method. To improve the solubility of the C&#8208;terminal region, O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After ligation by the thioester method and the introduction of the palmitoyl groups, all the protecting groups were removed and the isopeptide structures were converted into the native peptide bond. Finally, the obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into bicelles, thus showing the success of the synthesis.

         <title>ZW800&#8208;PEG: A Renal Clearable Zwitterionic Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophore for Potential Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13847-13852, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZW800&#8208;PEG is a water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;sticky, and renal clearable near&#8208;infrared fluorophore owing to the balanced zwitterionic charges. By introducing a stable sulfide linker, it improves serum stability and also exhibits potential for augmenting photothermal therapy. It shows a maximum emission wavelength at 800&#8197;nm, enabling its use for image&#8208;guided interventions in the OR using conventional near&#8208;infrared imaging systems.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. Despite tremendous advances in imaging devices, surprisingly only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previous fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker. ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800&#8197;nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and augmenting photothermal therapy.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Cancer Meroterpenoids Dysideanone&#8197;B and Dysiherbol&#8197;A and Structural Reassignment of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>

The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer natural products dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been completed and the structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised. A radical cyclization was employed to construct the 6/6/6/6 skeleton of dysideanone&#8197;B and a Heck reaction was utilized to forge the 6/6/5/6 core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer meroterpenoids dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been accomplished in a divergent way. The synthetic route features: 1)&#8197;a site and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;position alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone derivative with a bulky benzyl bromide to join the terpene and aromatic moieties together and set the stage for subsequent cyclization reactions; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular radical cyclization to construct the 6/6/6/6&#8208;tetracycle of dysideanone&#8197;B and an intramolecular Heck reaction to forge the 6/6/5/6&#8208;fused core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A. A late&#8208;stage introduction of the ethoxy group in dysideanone&#8197;B reveals that this group might come from the solvent ethanol. The structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised based on our chemical total synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzothiophene/Benzofuran&#8208;Fused Biaryls by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Arene Formation</title>

The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed enantioselective de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzylbenzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes has been developed. This cascade process comprises a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion, allowing rapid access to atropoisomeric tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are prevalent in natural products, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. However, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed de novo construction of an aromatic ring with concomitant axial chirality induction for the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers is far less developed, and the efficient synthesis of axially chiral tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls remains an unsolved problem under NHC catalysis. Reported here is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes through a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. The developed method provides efficient and general access to novel axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls in high enantioselectivities and works well for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls.

         <title>Enzyme Mimic Facilitated Artificial Cell to Mammalian Cell Signal Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyzing biochemical reactions with enzymes and communicating with neighboring cells via chemical signaling are two fundamental cellular features that play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of organisms. Herein, we present an artificial enzyme (AE) facilitated signal transfer between artificial cells (ACs) and mammalian HepG2 cells. We synthesize metalloporphyrins (MPs) based AEs that mimic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) to catalyze a dealkylation and a hydroxylation reaction, exemplified by the conversion of resorufin ethyl ether (REE) to resorufin and coumarin (COU) to 7&#8208;hydroxycoumarin (7&#8208;HC), respectively. The AEs are immobilized in hydrogels to produce ACs that generate the two diffusive fluorophores, which can diffuse into HepG2 cells and result in dual intracellular emissions. This work highlights the use of AEs to promote AC to mammalian signal transfer, which opens up new opportunities for integrating the synthetic and living world with a bottom&#8208;up strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;directed modification of active Matrix Metalloproteases: New activity&#8208;based probes with no photolabile group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activity&#8208;based probes enable discriminating between the active enzyme and its inactive or inactivated counterparts. Since metalloproteases catalysis is non&#8208;covalent, activity&#8208;based probes targeting them have been systematically developed by decorating reversible inhibitors with photo&#8208;crosslinkers. By exploiting two types of ligand&#8208;guided chemistry, we identified novel activity&#8208;based probes capable of covalently modifying matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) active site without any external trigger. The ability of these probes to label recombinant MMPs was validated in vitro and the identity of the main labelling sites within their S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rsquo; region unambiguously assigned. We also demonstrated that our affinity probes can react with rhMMP12 at nanogram scale present at 0.07% (w/w) in complex proteomes. &amp;nbsp;Finally, this ligand&#8208;directed chemistry was successfully applied to label active MMP&#8208;12 secreted by eukaryote cells. We believe that this approach could be transferred more widely to many other metalloproteases, thus contributing to tackle their unresolved proteomic profiling in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network Determines the Early Photoisomerization of Cph1 and AnPixJ Phytochromes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytochrome proteins are light receptors that play a pivotal role in regulating the life cycles of plants and microorganisms. Intriguingly, while cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and cyanobacteriochrome AnPixJ use the same phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore to absorb light, their excited&#8208;state behavior is very different. We employ multiscale calculations to rationalize the different early photoisomerization mechanisms of PCB in Cph1 and AnPixJ. We find that their electronic S  1  , T  1  , and S  0  potential minima exhibit distinct geometric and electronic structures due to different hydrogen bond networks with the protein environment. These specific interactions influence the S  1  electronic structures along the photoisomerization paths, ultimately leading to internal conversion in Cph1 but intersystem crossing in AnPixJ. This explains why the excited&#8208;state relaxation in AnPixJ is much slower (ca. 100 ns) than in Cph1 (ca. 30 ps). Further, we predict that efficient internal conversion in AnPixJ can be achieved upon protonating the carboxylic group that interacts with PCB. Our work not only exemplifies the decisive role of protonation in tuning the photochemistry of biological chromophores, but also represents an important step toward comprehensive understanding the natural evolution of bilin&#8208;containing photoreceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective bacterial targeting and infection&#8208;triggered release of antibiotic colistin conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of life&#8208;threatening diseases with small molecule drugs often leads to a fragile balance between desired efficacy and undesired toxic effects. A prominent example concerns the natural lipopeptide colistin that has been re&#8208;introduced clinically as a &#8216;last resort&#8217; antibiotic for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant infections, in spite of strong and frequent nephrotoxic effects. In order to render such potent, but toxic antibiotics more selective, we have explored a novel conjugation strategy that includes drug accumulation followed by infection&#8208;triggered release of the drug. Bacterial targeting was achieved using a modified fragment of the human antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin, as demonstrated by fluorophore&#8208;tagged variants. To limit the release of the effector colistin only to infection&#8208;related situations, we introduced a linker that was cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme secreted by neutrophils at infection sites. The linker carried an optimized sequence of amino acids that was required to assure sufficient cleavage efficiency. The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1&#8208; or the 3&#8208;position of colistin. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept was achieved in co&#8208;cultures of primary human neutrophils and  Escherichia  coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.</dc:description>

         <title>Current&#8208;density regulating lithium metal directional deposition for long cycle&#8208;life Li metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrolled dendrite formation in the high energy density of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) may pose serious safety risks. While numerous studies have attempted to protect separators, these proposed methods fail to effectively inhibit upward dendrite growth that punctures through the separator. Here, we introduce a novel &#8216;orientated&#8208;growth&#8217; strategy that transfers the main depositional interface to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface. We placed a layer of cellulose/graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) between the current collector and the anode (LCL&#8208;bottom). This layer works as a charge organizer; it induces a higher apparent current density and encourages Li to deposit at the anode/current collector interface. Both  in situ  and  ex situ  images of the electrode demonstrate that the anode part of the cell has been flipped; with the newly deposited particles facing the current collector and the smooth surface facing the separator. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode in half and full cells showed outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability, with the LCL&#8208;bottom/LPF full cell capable of maintaining 94% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. We believe that this innovative strategy will leapfrog the barriers of LMBs development.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortions of Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based Prussian Blue, Na2&#8208;&#948;Mn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is an auspicious candidate for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. In this work, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel&#8208;based Prussian Blue (Na2&#8208;&#948;Ni[Fe(CN)6]). The one&#8208;pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core&#8208;shell materials, which traditionally require several steps. The resulting material has an electrochemical capacity of 93 mA h g&#8208;1, of which it retains 96% after 500 charge&#8208;discharge cycles (vs 37% for MnPB). The material&#8217;s rate capability is also remarkable: at 4 A g&#8208;1 (ca. 55 C) it can reversibly store 70 mA h g&#8208;1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ~10&#8208;8 cm2 s&#8208;1. The epitaxial nature of the outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, which may prevent the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de&#8208;sodiation.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Approach to Convert Hemicyanine Dyes into Highly Optimized Photoacoustic Scaffolds for Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents are based on the repurposing of existing fluorescent dye platforms that exhibit non&#8208;optimal properties for PA applications. Herein, we introduce PA&#8208;HD, a new dye scaffold optimized for PA probe development which features an increase in sensitivity of 4.8&#8208;fold and a red&#8208;shift of the &#955;  abs  from 690 nm to 745 nm to enable ratiometric imaging. Computational modelling was employed to elucidate the origin of these enhanced properties. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalizability of our remodeling efforts, we developed three probes for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal), nitroreductase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR), and H  2  O  2  (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H  2  O  2  ). We generated two cancer models to evaluate PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR. Additionally, we employed a murine model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease to test PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H  2  O  2  . In this latter example, we observed a PA signal increase at 735 nm of 1.79 &#177; 0.20&#8208;fold relative to background indicating the presence of oxidative stress. These results were confirmed via ratiometric calibration which was not possible using the parent HD platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogs, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified  p  &#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners.  p  &#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91%  ee  , following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95%  ee  . Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports mechanism proceeding via a S  N  2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;&#8208;position of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthesis of SF5Cl from sulfur powder, dry KF, and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) in MeCN is described. The new synthetic utility of SF5Cl is well demonstrated by the chemoselective hydro(chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of diazo compounds.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF5 group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF5Cl often relies on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatus. Herein, we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF5Cl in n&#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF5Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K3PO4 or copper catalyst, respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds of high value for potential applications.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl or Monocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds are shown to undergo Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation. This method has led to an array of valuable cyclopropanes in yields of up to 90&#8201;% and with exclusive regioselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes by the decomposition of diazo compounds is a powerful and straightforward strategy to produce cyclopropanes, but is tempered by the potentially explosive nature of diazo substrates. Herein we report the Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation of readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, in which one of the two carbonyl groups acts as a carbene equivalent upon deoxygenation and engages in the subsequent cyclopropanation process. The use of a commercially available Mo catalyst afforded an array of valuable cyclopropanes with exclusive regioselectivity in up to 90&#8201;% yield. The synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that phosphine (or silane) acts as both a mild reductant and a good oxygen acceptor that efficiently regenerates the catalytically active Mo catalyst through reduction of the Mo&#8208;oxo complexes.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkenylative Arylation of Alkenes with Arylboronic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes with arylboronic compounds has been developed to provide an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8722;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemoselectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic tungsten on graphene with a unique W state of the W&#8208;N2O2 structure are first used to decorate the separator of a Li&#8208;S battery to promote its electrochemical performance. The unique local coordination structure of W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C moiety not only acts as an active site for anchoring lithium polysulfides, but also boosts their kinetic conversion via electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;utilization are advantagous in serving as anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% is proposed by a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy. The local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity. LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. It indicates high areal capacity of 6.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy par excellence to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established 13C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Oligomerization by Silylene&#8208;Tethered Sonogashira Coupling on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coupling module composed of (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups selectively accelerated sluggish desilylative on&#8208;surface Sonogashira coupling with homocoupling efficiently suppressed. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) with a CO&#8208;functionalized tip enabled investigation of this coupling reaction and evaluation of its chemoselectivity (see picture).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful method for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials. Herein, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups in silylethynyl&#8208; and chloro&#8208;substituted partially fluorinated phenylene ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling occurred with high chemoselectivity up to 75&#8201;%, while the competing Ullmann and desilylative Glaser homocoupling reactions were suppressed. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and DFT calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of intermolecular silylene tethers (&#8208;Me2Si&#8208;) through CH3&#8722;Si bond activation at 130&#8201;&#176;C and subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte structure of lithium polysulfides (PSs) with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether as a cosolvent, the reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. The stability of practical Li&#8211;S batteries was improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated.







Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between the Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for Efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;Based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first joint experimental&#8211;computational study of fluorocarbon adsorption into porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) reveals that the presence of structure defects leading to the creation of mesopores with a broad size range offers not only exceptional high&#8208;uptake adsorption of fluorocarbon R134a, but also unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms. COPs are thus proven to be excellent sorbent materials for cooling applications.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy&#8208;efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based on atomistic defect&#8208;containing models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for various defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defect&#8208;containing porous COPs are promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.

         <title>The Role of Rotational Motion in Diffusion NMR Experiments on Supramolecular Assemblies: Application to Sup35NM Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion of amyloid fibrils that contain disordered domains can be captured by pulsed&#8208;field&#8208;gradient NMR experiments. A new theory is presented that interprets the results of these measurements in terms of fibrils&#8217; translational and rotational motion. Application to Sup35NM fibrils demonstrates the feasibility of diffusion&#8208;based sorting in complex amyloidogenic samples.







Abstract
Pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG) NMR is an important tool for characterization of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies. However, for micrometer&#8208;sized objects, such as amyloid fibrils, these experiments become difficult to interpret because in addition to translational diffusion they are also sensitive to rotational diffusion. We have constructed a mathematical theory describing the outcome of PFG NMR experiments on rod&#8208;like fibrils. To test its validity, we have studied the fibrils formed by Sup35NM segment of the prion protein Sup35. The interpretation of the PFG NMR data in this system is fully consistent with the evidence from electron microscopy. Contrary to some previously expressed views, the signals originating from disordered regions in the fibrils can be readily differentiated from the similar signals representing small soluble species (e.g. proteolytic fragments). This paves the way for diffusion&#8208;sorted NMR experiments on complex amyloidogenic samples.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vivo structure of the redox&#8208;active tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase that catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks was explored using advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, the radical form of a tyrosine derivative within the cells was generated. Our results mark the initial steps towards gaining unique insights into the redox reactions involving tyrosyl radicals under physiological conditions.







Abstract
The E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di&#8208;iron tyrosyl radical (Y122.) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on the in vitro Y122. structure and its radical distribution within the &#946;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet little information exists on the in vivo Y122.. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR and electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y122. are identical under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct in vivo Y122. per &#946;2 distribution, supporting the key role of Y. concentrations in regulating RNR activity. Additionally, we spectroscopically verify the generation of an unnatural amino acid radical, F3Y122., in whole cells, providing a crucial step towards unique insights into the RNR catalysis under physiological conditions.

     alt="In-Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in vivo structure of the redox-active tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase that catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks was explored using advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, the radical form of a tyrosine derivative within the cells was generated. Our results mark the initial steps towards gaining unique insights into the redox reactions involving tyrosyl radicals under physiological conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di-iron tyrosyl radical (Y&lt;sub&gt;122&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on the in vitro Y&lt;sub&gt;122&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; structure and its radical distribution within the &#946;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet little information exists on the in vivo Y&lt;sub&gt;122&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi-frequency EPR and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y&lt;sub&gt;122&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; are identical under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct in vivo Y&lt;sub&gt;122&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; per &#946;2 distribution, supporting the key role of Y&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations in regulating RNR activity. Additionally, we spectroscopically verify the generation of an unnatural amino acid radical, F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;122&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;, in whole cells, providing a crucial step towards unique insights into the RNR catalysis under physiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
An efficient ODI&#8208;[5+2] cascade reaction of sensitive ethynylphenols was achieved under mild electrochemical conditions, which led to the rapid construction of a series of bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone skeletons. By incorporation of a directed retro&#8208;aldol/aldol process, a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and an Al(O&#8208;iPr)3&#8208;promoted reductive 1,3&#8208;transposition, the asymmetric total syntheses of five 8,9&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;kauranoids have been accomplished.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer from HOO. to ortho&#8208;Quinones Explains the Antioxidant Activity of Polydopamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine, a melanin analogue, is an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) only in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). Activation of the ortho&#8208;quinones moieties by HOO., and formation of exposed semiquinones are proposed as the reason of the peculiar antioxidant activity.







Abstract
Melanins are stable and non&#8208;toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear. Herein, we show that polydopamine (PDA), a well&#8208;known synthetic melanin, becomes an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). The key reaction explaining this peculiar antioxidant activity is the reduction of the ortho&#8208;quinone moieties present in PDA by the reaction with HOO.. This reaction occurs via a H&#8208;atom transfer mechanism, as demonstrated by the large kinetic solvent effect of the reaction of a model quinone (3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone) with HOO. (k=1.5&#215;107 and 1.1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in PhCl and MeCN). The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox&#8208;mediated bioactivity of melanins and of quinones.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Single&#8208;Diamond&#8208;Surface Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica scaffold with single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface networks has been synthesized via self&#8208;assembly of the triblock terpolymer and inorganic source. The structural transition and the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature are the key for the formation of the single&#8208;diamond structure.







Abstract
Biological scaffolds with hyperbolic surfaces, especially single gyroid and single&#8208;diamond structures, have sparked immense interest for creating novel materials due to their extraordinary physical properties. However, the ability of nature to create these unbalanced surfaces has not been achieved in either lyotropic liquid crystals or block copolymer phases due to their thermodynamical instability in these systems. Here, we report the synthesis of a porous silica scaffold with a single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface structure fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of the poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) and silica precursors in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water. The single&#8208;diamond structure with tetrahedral interconnected frameworks was revealed by the electron crystallographic reconstruction. We assume that the formation of single networks is induced by the structural transition and related to the energetic change due to the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature. This work may provide new insights into these biologically relevant surfaces and related self&#8208;assembly systems.

         <title>Getting Ready for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: The Infrared Spectrum of Hydrated Aluminum Hydride&#8211;Hydroxide HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8722;1, n=9&#8211;14</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules must arrange around an aluminum hydride&#8211;hydroxide unit in a specific way to enable elimination of molecular hydrogen. Infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy reveals that hydrogen bonding to the hydride takes place in a six&#8208;coordinate AlIII hydride&#8211;hydroxide complex. The smallest cluster size for which hydride hydrogen bonding dominates is also the cluster size for which hydrogen evolution becomes efficient.







Abstract
Hydrated singly charged aluminum ions eliminate molecular hydrogen in a size regime from 11 to 24 water molecules. Here we probe the structure of HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8722;1, n=9&#8211;14, by infrared multiple photon spectroscopy in the region of 1400&#8211;2250&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 1850&#8197;cm&#8722;1 to the Al&#8722;H stretch in five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n=12. The frequency of the Al&#8722;H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded Al&#8722;H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al&#8722;H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al&#8722;H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple yet uncharacterized high energy tautomer of glycolic acid, namely 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, an important molecule in the abiotic synthesis of sugar acids, has now been identified by IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. With these data now in hand, it now awaits its identification in space as another building block for prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
As low&#8208;temperature conditions (e.g. in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example, we present here the synthesis as well as IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400&#8201;&#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10&#8197;K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8211;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254&#8197;nm, 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.

         <title>Origin of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;Effect in SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophiles (R&#8211;Y&#8211;X:&#8211;  ) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R&#8211;X:&#8211;  ) by deviating from the classical Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type reactivity&#8211;basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including&#160;  O&#8208;,&#160;N&#8208; and&#160;S&#8208;based normal and&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with&#160; ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect: (i) a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied&#8211;occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii) a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no&#160;a&#8208;effect or inverse&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect. These principles will allow one to qualitatively predict if an&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile possesses&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect solely based on the electronic structure of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile and, therefore, have the potential to enable chemists to better understand these fundamental&#160;reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Ionization Induced Stable White Organic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials with afterglow duration in the scale of minutes or even hours are still rare. Most OLPL systems are based on exciplexes, which require complicated multi&#8208;component system in order to realize white afterglow with slightly compromised duration and color stability. In this work, OLPLs lasting from 20 to 40 minutes are realized with a simple binary system based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism, which can harvest simultaneously excitons from both singlet and triplet excited states, making it potentially the most promising candidate to achieve stable white OLPL. Through modulation and optimization of dopant structures in dibenzo[b,d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yldiphenyl phosphine oxide host, the emission profiles of afterglow can be readily tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46), with excellent color consistency.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Intermolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for Water&#8208;Stable Low Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociates in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long&#8208;range intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between A&#8208;site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A&#8208;site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;&#8208;TMDP)Pb  2  Br  6  ], a one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions are obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is further extended to another A&#8208;site cation 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP), forming water&#8208;stable (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP)Pb  2  Br  6  perovskite. These water&#8208;stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light&#8208;emitting diode and for light up&#8208;conversion through tunable third&#8208;harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water&#8208;resistant materials. The introduced cation&#8208;&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water&#8208;stable low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Being Transformed into Metal Single Atoms with Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Structure and High&#8208;Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere are directly observed.







Abstract
Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis conditions is a highly efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordination are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

Relying on principles of supramolecular chemistry, this manuscript describes the design, characterization, and implementation of a method for the generation of artificial (non&#8208;luminescent) colors for MRI applications. The proposed approach, which is termed GEST, exploits the reversible binding of inhalable biocompatible fluorinated agent to macrocycle hosts for micromolar detectability of host&#8211;guest complexes using background&#8208;free 19F&#8208;MRI.







Abstract
The weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins limits the sensitivity of MRI, even for MR&#8208;sensitive nuclei as fluorine&#8208;19. Therefore, despite being the source of inspiration for the development of background&#8208;free MRI for various applications, including for multiplexed imaging, the inability to map very low concentrations of targets using 19F&#8208;MRI raises the need to further enhance this platform's capabilities. Here, we employ the principles of CEST&#8208;MRI in 19F&#8208;MRI to obtain a 900&#8208;fold signal amplification of a biocompatible fluorinated agent, which can be presented in a &#8220;multicolor&#8221; fashion. Capitalizing on the dynamic interactions in host&#8211;guest supramolecular assemblies in an approach termed GEST, we demonstrate that an inhalable fluorinated anesthetic can be used as a single 19F&#8208;probe for the concurrent detection of micromolar levels of two targets, with potential in vivo translatability. Further extending GEST with new designs could expand the applicability of 19F&#8208;MRI to the mapping of targets that have so&#8208;far remained non&#8208;detectable.

         <title>Engineering Nanoparticulate Organic Photocatalysts via a Scalable Flash Nanoprecipitation Process for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with rationally designed hydrophilic polymers to prepare nanoparticulate photocatalysts is presented. It is effective in addressing limitations of bulky particles and greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. This nanostructure engineering is promising for scale&#8208;up owing to the continuous operation of FNP, leading to potential practical applications of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.







Abstract
Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (PC&#8208;PEG5 and PS&#8208;PEG5) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized PC&#8208;PEG5, and the FNP&#8208;processed PS&#8208;PEG5 shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under full&#8208;spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. A scaling&#8208;up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP.

         <title>The Origin of Catalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxidation over a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions has been achieved using a robust metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. EPR spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction have identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H compounds to ketones is important for the production of a wide range of fine chemicals, and is often achieved using toxic or precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report the efficient oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions over a robust metal&#8211;organic framework material, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. A comprehensive investigation employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction has identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.

         <title>Dynamic Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution of Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) is presented herein. It combines all the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry with the versatility of the tetrazine moiety. Indeed, libraries of compounds or sophisticated molecular structures can be easily obtained, which are susceptible to post&#8208;functionalization by Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which also locks the exchange. Additionally, the structures obtained can be disassembled upon the application of the right stimulus, either UV&#8208;irradiation or a suitable chemical reagent. Moreover, SNTz is compatible with the imine chemistry of anilines. The high potential of this methodology has been proved by building two responsive supramolecular systems: A macrocycle that displays a light&#8208;induced release of acetylcholine; and a truncated [4+6] tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent fluorescent cage which is disassembled by thiols unless it is post&#8208;stabilized by IEDDA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The sustainable capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) is key to achieving a circular carbon economy. Bioelectrocatalysis, which aims at using renewable energies to power the highly specific, direct transformation of CO  2  into value added products holds promise to achieve this goal. However, the functional integration of CO  2  &#8208;fixing enzymes onto electrode materials for the electrosynthesis of stereochemically complex molecules remains to be demonstrated. Here, we show the electricity&#8208;driven regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO  2  into crotonyl&#8208;CoA by an NADPH&#8208;dependent enzymatic reductive carboxylation. Co&#8208;Immobilization of a ferredoxin NADP  +  reductase and crotonyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase/reductase within a 2,2&#180;&#8208;viologen modified hydrogel enabled iterative NADPH recycling and stereoselective formation of (2  S  )&#8208;ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, a prospective intermediate towards multi&#8208;carbon products from CO  2  , with 92&#160;&#177;&#160;6&#160;% faradaic efficiency and at a rate of 1.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm  &#8208;2  &#160;h  &#8208;1  .

Here, we show the electricity-driven regio- and stereoselective incorporation of CO  2  into crotonyl-CoA by an NADPH-dependent enzymatic reductive carboxylation. Co-Immobilization of a ferredoxin NADP  +  reductase and crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase within a 2,2&#180;-viologen modified hydrogel enabled iterative NADPH recycling and stereoselective formation of (2  S  )-ethylmalonyl-CoA, a prospective intermediate towards multi-carbon products from CO  2  , with 92&#160;&#177;&#160;6&#160;% faradaic efficiency and at a rate of 1.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm  -2  &#160;h  -1  . This approach opens the way for realizing even more complex bioelectrocatalyic cascades in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and becomes effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Demethylation by a Cas13d&#8208;Directed Demethylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  1  &#8208;methyladenosine (m  1  A) is a prevalent and reversible RNA modification, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA fate and gene expression. However, the lack of tools to precisely manipulate m  1  A sites in specific transcripts has hindered efforts to  clarify the association between a specific m  1  A&#8208;modified transcript and its phenotypic outcomes.  Here we develop a CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d&#8208;based tool called  re  engineered m  1  A  mo  dification  v  alid  er  aser (termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;) for targeted m  1  A demethylation of a specific transcript. The catalytically inactive RfxCas13d (dCasRx) is fused to the m  1  A demethylase ALKBH3, and the dCasRx&#8208;ALKBH3 fusion protein can mediate potent demethylation of m  1  A&#8208;modified RNAs. We further find that REMOVER can specifically demethylate m  1  A of MALAT1 and PRUNE1 RNAs, thereby significantly increasing their stability. Our study establishes REMOVER as a tool for targeted RNA demethylation of specific m  1  A&#8208;modified transcripts, which enables further elucidation of the relationship between m  1  A modification of specific transcripts and their phenotypic outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial order of functional modules enabling diverse intracellular performance of fluorescent probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome a series of challenges in tumor therapy, modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) comprised of various functional modules have been proposed. Nowadays, researchers have tried to optimize the MAPs by exploiting the new modules or increasing the numbers of module, while neglecting the configuration of various modules. Here, we focus on the different spatial&#8208;arrangements of existing modules. By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end&#8208;group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial&#8208;arrangements (on the one side, TM&#8208;AIE, and two sides, T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. It was found that T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with bigger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity. This interesting phenomenon sheds light on the design concept of future MAPs and opens a window for the renaissance of existing MAPs by rearranging modules.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Replacement with Complete Preservation of Crystal Lattice in Mixed&#8208;Anion Lanthanide Oxyhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical halide ion replacement in lanthanide oxyiodide nanostructures proceeds with complete preservation of the tetragonal matlockite crystal structure along a gradient of increasing anion hardness. Reformation of the anion lattice around the intact cation slabs impedes 5D3&#8208;5D4 phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation and is observed as a distinctive blue hue for an embedded quantum reporter.







Abstract
A challenge in anion control in periodic solids is to preserve the crystal lattice while substituting for different anions of widely varying size and hardness. Post&#8208;synthetic modification routes that place cations or anions in non&#8208;equilibrium configurations are promising; however, such methods remain relatively unexplored for anion placement. Here, we report the synthesis of LaOI nanocrystals by a non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel condensation reaction and their transformation into LaOBr, LaOCl, and LaOF nanocrystals along hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principles using post&#8208;synthetic metathesis reactions with ammonium halides. Anion displacement proceeds along halide planes, preserving the tetragonal matlockite structure. Energy&#8208;variant X&#8208;ray excited optical luminesce signatures of alloyed Tb3+&#8208;ions is a sensitive quantum reporter of the preservation of the cation sublattice and hardening of the crystal structure upon anion replacement.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrofluorescence Material Based on Pure Organic Phosphor Sensitization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of electroluminescence films based on a purely organic phosphor sensitizing fluorescence emitter were developed. A series of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8208;sensitized fluorescent materials with the capacity to break the limitation of 25&#8201;% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for normal electrofluorescence devices was constructed.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are considered as potential candidates for replacing precious metal complexes to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, applications of the reported RTP materials in OLEDs are seriously impeded by their low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in a thin film state. To overcome these obstacles, we established a new strategy to construct highly efficient OLEDs based on a pure organic RTP material sensitized fluorescence emitter by selecting benzimidazole&#8208;triazine molecules (PIM&#8208;TRZ), 2,6&#8208;di(phenothiazinyl)naphthalene (&#946;&#8208;DPTZN), and 5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) as host, phosphor sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter, respectively. The perfect combination of host, phosphorescent sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter in the emitting layer ensure the outstanding performance of the devices with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.7&#8201;%.

         <title>Enhancing anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 Immunotherapy by Nanomicelles Self&#8208;Assembled from Multivalent Aptamer Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a tumor&#8208;targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy, which is enabled by nanomicelles self&#8208;assembled from multivalent aptamer drug conjugates. Co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a multivalent PEG&#8208;conjugated drug analogue reaches an optimal complementation between the blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability of the nanomicelles, which augments the antitumor immune responses of the checkpoint blockade.







Abstract
A tumor&#8208;targeting enhanced chemotherapy, enabled by aptamer&#8208;drug conjugate nanomicelles, is reported that boosts antitumor immune responses. Multivalent aptamer drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid&#8208;labile linkers, was designed and synthesized. By co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, the surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments the tumor&#8208;specific immune responses of the checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

     alt="Enhancing anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy by Nanomicelles Self-Assembled from Multivalent Aptamer Drug Conjugates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a tumor-targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy, which is enabled by nanomicelles self-assembled from multivalent aptamer drug conjugates. Co-self-assembly with a multivalent PEG-conjugated drug analogue reaches an optimal complementation between the blood circulation and tumor-targeting ability of the nanomicelles, which augments the antitumor immune responses of the checkpoint blockade.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tumor-targeting enhanced chemotherapy, enabled by aptamer-drug conjugate nanomicelles, is reported that boosts antitumor immune responses. Multivalent aptamer drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid-labile linkers, was designed and synthesized. By co-self-assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, the surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor-targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments the tumor-specific immune responses of the checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice. ApMDC nanomicelles represent a robust platform for structure&#8211;function optimization of drug conjugates and nanomedicines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Deracemization of Carbohelicenes by a Chiral Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane Template Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral perylene bisimide cyclophane has been synthesized that shows high binding affinities for carbohelicene guests in organic solvents. The perfect shape complementarity of the host&#8211;guest system was utilized for the deracemization of conformationally labile [4]&#8208; and [5]&#8208;helicenes.







Abstract
Deracemization describes the conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral molecule into an enantioenriched mixture or an enantiopure compound without structural modifications. Herein, we report an inherently chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane whose chiral pocket is capable of transforming a racemic mixture of [5]&#8208;helicene into an enantioenriched mixture with an enantiomeric excess of 66&#8201;%. UV/Vis and fluorescence titration studies reveal this cyclophane host composed of two helically twisted PBI dyes has high binding affinities for the respective homochiral carbohelicene guests, with outstanding binding constants of up to 3.9&#215;1010&#8197;m&#8722;1 for [4]&#8208;helicene. 2D NMR studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis demonstrate that the observed strong and enantioselective binding of homochiral carbohelicenes and the successful template&#8208;catalyzed deracemization of [5]&#8208;helicene can be explained by the enzyme&#8208;like perfect shape complementarity of the macrocyclic supramolecular host.

         <title>A Modular In&#8197;Vitro Platform for the Production of Terpenes and Polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle and a natural glyoxylate assimilation cycle with different biosynthetic pathways enables the sustainable production of terpenes and polyketides. Demonstration of this modular, multi&#8208;enzyme in&#8197;vitro platform sets the stage for a diversified synthesis of pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals directly from CO2.







Abstract
A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO2 as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, fragrances and food additives. Here we developed a modular in&#8197;vitro platform for the continuous conversion of CO2 into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO2 into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simultaneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29&#8197;enzymes in one pot, which paves the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO2&#8208;based chemicals in the future.

         <title>Reducing defects density and enhancing hole extraction for efficient perovskite solar cells enabled by &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular doping is an of significance approach to reduce defects density of perovskite and to improve interfacial charge extraction in perovskite solar cells. Here, we show a new strategy for chemical doping of perovskite via an organic small molecule, which features a fused tricyclic core, showing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions with under&#8208;coordinated Pb  2+  in perovskite. This &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions could reduce defects density of the perovskite and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. In addition, this doping via &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed excellent efficiency of 21.41% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core&#8208;based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Diethynyl Phosphinates for Cysteine&#8208;Selective Protein Labeling and Disulfide Rebridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diethynyl phosphonites were found to react specifically with two thiols in aqueous buffer to give constructs that are stable under physiological conditions. This enables the facile generation of protein (double)&#8208;conjugates. Moreover, these molecules can be used to rebridge the interchain disulfides of therapeutic IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Diethynyl phosphinates were developed as bisfunctional electrophiles for the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides, proteins and antibodies. One of their electron&#8208;deficient triple bonds reacts selectively with a thiol and positions an electrophilic moiety for a subsequent intra&#8208; or intermolecular reaction with another thiol. The obtained conjugates were found to be stable in human plasma and in the presence of small thiols. We further demonstrate that this method is suitable for the generation of functional protein conjugates for intracellular delivery. Finally, this reagent class was used to generate functional homogeneously rebridged antibodies that remain specific for their target. Their modular synthesis, thiol selectivity and conjugate stability make diethynyl phosphinates ideal candidates for protein conjugation for biological and pharmaceutical applications.

         <dc:description>2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film as active layer show promising application prospects in various fields including the sensors, catalysis, and electronic device. However, exploring the application of 2D MOF film in the field of artificial synapses has not been implemented yet. In this work, we fabricated one kind of novel monolayer MOF film (Cu&#8211;THPP, THPP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine), and further used it as an active layer to explore the application in the simulation of human brain synapses. It shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties, and exhibits the foundation function of synapses such as long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), and the conversion of STP to LTP. Most critically, the MOF based artificial synaptic device exhibit an excellent stability in atmosphere.

         <dc:description>An enantioselective methodology to construct trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder scaffolds by organocatalysis with excellent selectivity, high yield and up to five contiguous stereocenters is presented. The reaction concept integrates the halogen effect and a novel discovered pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to direct an endo&#8208;selective, secondary&#8208;amine catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reaction allowing for the subsequent formation of trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts featuring the norcarene scaffold. The methodology relies on the reaction between an in situ generated trienamine and an &#945;&#8208;brominated or &#945;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;halogenated enone to form a fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder intermediate. The endo&#8208;transition state&#8212;enhanced by the (pseudo&#8208;)halogen effect&#8212;sets the stereochemistry that allows for a subsequent SN2&#8208;like reaction at a tertiary center to obtain the trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder scaffold. The mechanism was investigated and supported by experimental results as well as computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Engineered Supported Gold Clusters as a Stable Catalyst for Propylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a stable and selective catalyst with high H  2  utilisation is of pivotal importance for the direct gas&#8208;phase epoxidation of propylene. This work describes a facile one&#8208;pot methodology to synthesise ligand&#8208;stabilised sub&#8208;nanometre gold clusters immobilised onto a zeolitic support (TS&#8208;1) to engineer a stable Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst. A non&#8208;thermal O  2  plasma technique is used for the quick removal of ligands with limited increase in particle size. Compared to untreated Au/TS&#8208;1 catalysts prepared using the deposition precipitation method, the synthesised catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance, including 10 times longer lifetime (&gt;20 days), increased PO selectivity and hydrogen efficiency in direct gas phase epoxidation. The structure&#8208;stability relationship of the catalyst is illustrated using multiple characterisation techniques, such as XPS,  31  P MAS NMR, DR&#8208;UV/VIS, HRTEM and TGA. It is hypothesised that the ligands play a guardian role in stabilising the Au particle size, which is vital in this reaction. This strategy is a promising approach towards designing a more stable and reproducible heterogeneous catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder Dimerization of ortho&#8208;Quinols in Natural Product (Bio)Synthesis: Bioinspired Chemical 6&#8208;Step Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Maytenone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesis of many natural bicyclo[2.2.2]octenone products involves the Diels&#8211;Alder cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols according to the same selectivity rules. This is illustrated by the enzyme&#8208;free synthesis of the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone, first achieved by a chiral iodane&#8208;mediated dearomative hydroxylation of (+)&#8208;ferruginol and a high pressure&#8208;promoted Diels&#8211;Alder reaction.







Abstract
Many natural products of plant or microbial origins are derived from enzymatic dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenolic precursors into 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienones. These so&#8208;called ortho&#8208;quinols cyclodimerize via a remarkably selective bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Whether or not the intervention of catalytic or dirigent proteins is involved during this final step of the biosynthesis of these natural products, this cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols can be chemically reproduced in the laboratory with the same strict level of site&#8208;specific regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This unique yet unified process, which finds its rationale in the inherent chemical reactivity of those ortho&#8208;quinols, is illustrated herein by an efficient and bioinspired first chemical synthesis of one of the most structurally complex and synthetically challenging examples of such natural cyclodimers, the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone.

         <title>Cycloaddition Cascades of Strained Alkynes and Oxadiazinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a computational and experimental study of the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The reaction proceeds by way of a pericyclic reaction cascade and leads to the formation of four new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Using M06&#8208;2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Decarboxylation Coupling Facilitated by Lock&#8208;to&#8208;Unlock Variation of Molecules upon the Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) involving relatively high energy barriers remains challenging due to a typical dilemma: firm molecular anchor is required to prevent molecular desorption upon the reaction, whereas sufficient lateral mobility is crucial for subsequent coupling and assembly. By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, we present a strategy to address this challenge. High&#8208;yield synthesis based on well&#8208;defined decarboxylation, intermediate transition and hexamerization is demonstrated, resulting in an extended and ordered network exclusively composed of the newly&#8208;synthesized macrocyclic compound. Thanks to the steric hindrance of its maleimide group, we attain a preferential selection of the coupling. This work unlocks a promising path to enrich the reaction types and improve the coupling selectivity hence the structual homogeneity of the final product for OSS.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface engineering and controlled ripening for seed&#8208;mediated growth of Au islands on Au nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering the nucleation and growth of plasmonic metals (Ag and Au) on their pre&#8208;existing seeds is expected to produce nanostructures with unconventional morphologies and plasmonic properties that may find unique applications in sensing, catalysis, and broadband energy harvesting. Typical seed&#8208;mediated growth processes take advantage of the perfect lattice match between the deposited metal and seeds to induce conformal coating, leading to either simple size increases (e.g., Au on Au) or the formation of core&#8208;shell structures (e.g., Ag on Au) with limited morphology change.

         <title>Redox&#8208;mediated Ambient electrolytic Nitrogen Reduction for Hydrazine and Ammonia Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ambient electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is extensively studied as a potential alternative to the capital and energy intensive Habor&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production. Most lab&#8208;based eNRRs are performed with catalyst directly loaded on the electrode surface, with which the catalyst loading, gas flow and current density are constrained leading to a low rate of production. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) using polyoxometalate (POM) as the electron and proton carrier which frees the Fe&#8208;TiO  2  catalyst from the electrode and shifts the reduction of nitrogen to a reactor tank. The RM&#8208;eNRR process has achieved an ammonium production yield of 25.1 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  or 5.0 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  at an ammonium concentration of 6.7 ppm. With excess catalyst, 61.0 ppm ammonium was accumulated in the electrolyte upon continuous operation, which is the highest concentration detected for ambient eNRR so far. The mechanism underlying the RM&#8208;eNRR was scrutinized both experimentally and computationally to delineate the POM&#8208;mediated charge transfer and hydrogenation process of nitrogen molecule on the catalyst. RM&#8208;eNRR is expected to provide an implementable solution to overcome the limitations in the conventional eNRR process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient hydrogenation and deuteration of alkenes using a nano&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;core&#8208;shell catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general protocol for the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of a variety of alkenes is presented. Key to success for these reactions is the use of a specific nickel&#8208;graphitic shell&#8208;based core&#8208;shell structured catalyst, which is conveniently prepared by impregnation and subsequent calcination of nickel nitrate on carbon at 450 oC under argon. Applying this nano&#8208;structured catalyst, both terminal and internal alkenes, which are of industrial and commercial importance, were selectively hydrogenated and deuterated at ambient conditions (room temperature using 1 bar hydrogen or 1 bar deuterium), giving access to the corresponding alkanes and deuterium&#8208;labelled alkanes in good to excellent yields. The synthetic utility and practicability of this Ni&#8208;based hydrogenation protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reactions as well as efficient catalyst recycling experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvated Nickel Complexes as Stoichiometric and Catalytic Perfluoroalkylation Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acetonitrile&#8208;solvated [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722;  was prepared in order to compare and contrast its reactivity with the known [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722;  towards organic electrophiles. Both [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722;  and [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722;  successfully react with aryl iodonium and diazonium salts as well as alkynyl iodonium salts to give fluoroalkylated organic products. Electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)3]&#8722;  suggests that, upon electro&#8208;oxidation to [(MeCN)nNiIII(C2F5)3], reductive homolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)2]. Catalytic C&#8208;H trifluoromethylations of electron rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722;  or the related [Ni(CF3)4]2&#8211;  . Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that &#8220;ligandless&#8221; nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF3  anions or radicals under catalytically relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Room Temperature Phosphorescent Emission Channels by Controlling the Excited&#8208;States Dynamics via J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling of excited&#8208;state dynamics plays a central role in tuning room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions, but remaining challenging in the exploration of organic luminescent materials (OLMs). Herein, we demonstrated the regulation of TADF and RTP emissions of a boron difluoride &#946;&#8208; acetylnaphthalene chelate (  &#946;  CBF  2  ) by controlling the excited&#8208;state dynamics via its J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation states. Two crystalline polymorphs emitting green and red light have been controllably obtained. Although both belong to the monoclinic system, the green and red crystals are dominated by J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation respectively, due to different molecular packing arrangements. Experimental and theoretical studies show that J&#8208;aggregation not only significantly reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states for the realization of ultra&#8208;fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, but also enhances the radiative decay of singlet, together leading to TADF. The H&#8208;aggregation accelerates the ISC and meanwhile suppresses the radiative decay of singlet, helping to stabilize the triplet exciton for RTP. These results deepen the understanding of the effect of aggregation on the luminescence mechanism of organic solids, and provide new strategy to tuning TADF and RTP OLMs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin A (1), a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered anti&#8208;malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment&#8208;assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#1255;llkopf&#8208;type condensation on a substituted &#946;&#8208;lactone and an ambitious late&#8208;stage one&#8208;pot alkyne cross metathesis &#8211; ring&#8208;closing metathesis (ACM&#8208;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E&#8208;alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}4].</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of methane to a methyl derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A promising strategy to break through the selectivity&#8208;conversion limit of direct methane conversion to achieve high yields is the protection of methanol via esterification to a more stable methyl ester. In this study, we present a novel aerobic methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester approach that utilizes a highly dispersed, cobalt&#8208;containing solid catalyst, along with significantly more favorable reaction conditions compared to existing homogeneously&#8208;catalyzed approaches (e.g. diluted acid, O  2  oxidant, moderate temperature and pressure). The trifluoroacetic acid medium is diluted (&lt; 25 wt%) with an inert fluorous co&#8208;solvent that can be recovered after the separation of the methyl trifluoroacetate via liquid&#8208;liquid extraction at ambient conditions. Silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalysts are highly active in this system, with competitive yields and turnovers in comparison to known aerobic transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems. This work highlights the need and potential to reinvigorate the development of methane conversion technologies through the innovative application and combination of concepts from across the community.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Bond Activation and Facile Intramolecular Aryl Transfer of Nickel&#8211;Aluminum Pincer&#8208;type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes supported by a pincer&#8208;type aluminum metalloligand were synthesized and demonstrated several unique modes of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. Unexpectedly, the PAlP framework reversibly converts between the alane and alumniyl through aryl group transmetalation between aluminum and nickel.







Abstract
Pincer&#8208;type nickel&#8211;aluminum complexes were synthesized using two equivalents of the phosphinoamide, [PhNCH2PiPr2]&#8722;. The Ni0&#8211;AlIII complexes, {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;N2) and {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;COD), where MesPAlP is (Mes)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2, were structurally characterized. The (PAlP)Ni system exhibited cooperative bond cleavage mediated by the two&#8208;site Ni&#8211;Al unit, including oxidative addition of aryl halides, H2 activation, and ortho&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond activation of pyridine N&#8208;oxide. One intriguing reaction is the reversible intramolecular transfer of the mesityl ring from the Al to the Ni site, which is evocative of the transmetalation step during cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The aryl&#8208;transfer product,(THF)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2Ni(Mes), is the first example of a first&#8208;row transition metal&#8211;aluminyl pincer complex. The addition of a judicious donor enables the Al metalloligand to convert reversibly between the alane and aluminyl forms via aryl group transfer to and from Ni, respectively. Theoretical calculations support a zwitterionic Ni&#948;&#8722;&#8211;Al&#948;+ electronic structure in the nickel&#8211;aluminyl complex.

         <title>Expedient Dual Co/Organophotoredox Catalyzed Stereoselective Synthesis of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis allows the stereocontrolled synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diol products featuring quaternary carbon centers using vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes as reaction partners. This streamlined method offers a wide scope of syn&#8208;configured products obtained under mild operating conditions, and control reactions suggest that diastereocontrol is exerted within a Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler type transition state.







Abstract
An efficient and attractive Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis protocol has been developed allowing the stereoselective access to a wide variety of syn&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;diols featuring quaternary carbon centers. The synthesis of the target molecules is achieved under ambient reaction conditions using modular and accessible reagents, substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes, and in short reaction times. Mechanistic control experiments suggest that the stereoselectivity can be rationalized via a preferred Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler transition state comprising a Co(allyl) species and an activated aldehyde. This newly developed process thus expands the use of base metal catalysis in the construction of challenging quaternary carbon stereocenters.

         <title>Probing Interfacial Electronic Effects on Single&#8208;Molecule Adsorption Geometry and Electron Transport at Atomically Flat Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy techniques have been successfully applied to probe a solvent modification induced interfacial electronic effect on tuning contact geometries and electron transport of pyridyl molecules at atomically flat Au (111). Modulation of binding geometry from vertical to tilted and flat is observed and a 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance is achieved.







Abstract
Clarifying interfacial electronic effects on molecular adsorption is significant in many chemical and biochemical processes. Here, we used STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy to probe electron transport and adsorption geometries of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (4,4&#8242;&#8208;BPY) at Au(111). Modifying the surface with 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation&#8208;containing ionic liquids (ILs) decreases surface electron density and stabilizes a vertical orientation of pyridine through nitrogen atom &#963;&#8208;bond interactions, resulting in uniform adsorption configurations for forming molecular junctions. Modulation from vertical, tilted, to flat, is achieved on adding water to ILs, leading to a new peak ascribed to CC stretching of adsorbed pyridyl ring and 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance. The dihedral angle between adsorbed pyridyl ring and surface decreases with increasing surface electronic density, enhancing electron donation from surface to pyridyl ring.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Aliphatic Fluorides via Reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkyl halides has been established, by demonstrating the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations exhibited high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Monofluorinated alkyl compounds are of great importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Herein, we describe a direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoromethylation of unactivated alkyl halides using a low&#8208;cost industrial raw material, bromofluoromethane, by demonstrating a general and efficient reductive cross&#8208;coupling of two alkyl halides. Results with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;fluoroalkane also demonstrate the viability of monofluoroalkylation, which further established the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations demonstrate high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies support a radical pathway. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction is first&#8208;order dependent on catalyst and alkyl bromide whereas the generation of monofluoroalkyl radical is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step. This strategy provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of aliphatic fluorides.

         <title>Selectivity and Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex Binders Activated by Adaptive Binding and Controlled by Chemical Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PtII compound was synthesized and adaptively bound G&#8208;quadruplex DNA through kinetic control. The solution structure of the complex was solved. It was further proved that the compound can target G&#8208;quadruplex in living cells, repress VEGF expression in cancer cells and inhibit blood vessels growth in zebrafish.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent in oncogenes and are potential antitumor drug targets. However, binding selectivity of compounds to G4s still faces challenges. Herein, we report a platinum(II) complex (Pt1), whose affinity to G4&#8208;DNA is activated by adaptive binding and selectivity controlled by binding kinetics. The resolved structure of Pt1/VEGF&#8208;G4 (a promoter G4) shows that Pt1 matches 3&#8242;&#8208;G&#8208;tetrad of VEGF&#8208;G4 through Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation and loop rearrangement of VEGF&#8208;G4. Binding rate constants are determined by coordination bond breakage/formation, correlating fully with affinities. The selective rate&#8208;determining binding step, Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation upon G4&#8208;binding, is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than dsDNA. Pt1 potently targets G4 in living cells, effectively represses VEGF expression, and inhibits vascular growth in zebrafish. We show adaptive G4&#8208;binding activation and controlled by kinetics, providing a complementary design principle for compounds targeting G4 or similar biomolecules.

The resolved structure of &lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt;/VEGF-G4 (a promoter G4) shows that &lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt; matches 3&#8242;-G-tetrad of VEGF-G4 through Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-dissociation and loop rearrangement of VEGF-G4. Binding rate constants are determined by coordination bond breakage/formation, correlating fully with affinities. The selective rate-determining binding step, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-dissociation upon G4-binding, is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than dsDNA. &lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt; potently targets G4 in living cells, effectively represses VEGF expression, and inhibits vascular growth in zebrafish. We show adaptive G4-binding activation and controlled by kinetics, providing a complementary design principle for compounds targeting G4 or similar biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programming Fluorogenic DNA Probes for Rapid Detection of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers based on forced intercalation (FIT) were developed to detect steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in clinical human serum samples. These FIT&#8208;aptamers offer several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).







Abstract
The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies require aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green&#8208;fluorescent FIT&#8208;aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we could identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. This enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation&#8211;Acyl Cyclization between Enol Lactones and Organomagnesium Halides: Facile Synthesis of Indenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of functionalized organomagnesium halides and enol lactones underwent rhenium&#8208;catalyzed sequential arylation&#8211;acyl cyclization under mild reaction conditions, thus providing an expedient route to polyfunctionalized indenones with complete control of regioselectivity. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and synthetic utility in the straightforward synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A set of rhenium&#8208;catalyzed arylation&#8211;acyl cyclizations between (hetero)arylmagnesium halides and enol lactones through a cascade C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2)/C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Indeed, a wide range of functional groups on both organomagnesium halides and enol lactones is well tolerated by the simple rhenium catalysis, thus furnishing polyfunctionalized indenones in one&#8208;pot fashion and with complete control of the regioselectivity. Moreover, this approach also provides a straightforward synthetic route to neolignan and (iso)pauciflorol&#8197;F. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reaction involves a sequence of syn&#8208;carborhenation and intramolecular nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering in High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Emissive Mesopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular weight engineering of red&#8208;emissive mesopolymer with no detectable homo&#8208;coupling defects, fine&#8208;tuned energy level and better bipolar mobility was carried out. OFET and OLED based on the materials mark application potential in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Mesopolymers with high solubility, free of structural defects, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. Organic light emitting transistors that combine the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and organic field&#8208;effect transistors. However, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Herein, three low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8211;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained. The mesopolymers show strong solid&#8208;state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature. The mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50&#8201;% in solution and 10&#8201;% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Inorganic Tin Perovskite Solar Cells Prepared by Templated Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A templated growth approach, in which the crystallization of a 3D perovskite is guided by a dynamically dominant 2D structure, was established for the fabrication of a low&#8208;dimensional perovskite thin film with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size. The template growth is enabled by the reduced crystallization barrier of the 2D PEA2SnI4&#8722;xSCNx intermediate.







Abstract
The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on the precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite, CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x, with a mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. A kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2 and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form a 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of the 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x. The film shows an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability, and oxidation resistance. A solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01&#8201;%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air.

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid electrolyte design inherits the merits of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, showing promising features for next&#8208;generation redox flow batteries: non&#8208;flammability, wide potential window, and wide operational temperature range. This work presents a promising electrolyte chemistry towards safe and wide&#8208;temperature large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5&#8197;V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9&#8201;%, showing long cycling stability over 800&#8197;cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C for 150&#8197;cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.

In addition to the non-flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5&#8197;V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &amp;gt;99.9&#8201;%, showing long cycling stability over 800&#8197;cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C for 150&#8197;cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high-performance large-scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interactions in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Isoreticular Series for Molecular Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The search for more efficient and stable catalysts often yields hybrid host&#8211;guest systems. This work rationally engineered a series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks as hosts and selectively positioned guests, a CO2 reduction catalyst and a photosensitizer, on the surface or inside the pores for photocatalytic solar fuel production. The results help understand host&#8211;guest interactions and provide transferrable criteria for material design.







Abstract
A strategy to improve homogeneous molecular catalyst stability, efficiency, and selectivity is the immobilization on supporting surfaces or within host matrices. Herein, we examine the co&#8208;immobilization of a CO2 reduction catalyst [ReBr(CO)3(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)] and a photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(5,5&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)]Cl2 using the isoreticular series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO&#8208;66, &#8208;67, and &#8208;68. Specific host pore size choice enables distinct catalyst and photosensitizer spatial location&#8212;either at the outer MOF particle surface or inside the MOF cavities&#8212;affecting catalyst stability, electronic communication between reaction center and photosensitizer, and consequently the apparent catalytic rates. These results allow for a rational understanding of an optimized supramolecular layout of catalyst, photosensitizer, and host matrix.

         <title>Collective Vibrational Strong Coupling Effects on Molecular Vibrational Relaxation and Energy Transfer: Numerical Insights via Cavity Molecular Dynamics Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We performed cavity molecular dynamics simulations and showed that, under vibrational strong coupling conditions, vibrational relaxation and energy transfer from hot to thermal molecules can be accelerated relative to that outside a cavity due to polariton&#8208;accelerated intermolecular vibrational energy transfer.







Abstract
For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid&#8208;phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot&#8208;molecule relaxation. This acceleration stems from the fact that polaritons can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates 1)&#8197;resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, 2)&#8197;cooperatively depend on Rabi splitting, and 3)&#8197;collectively scale with the number of hot molecules. For larger cavity volumes, the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N&#8776;104 molecules forming VSC. Moreover, the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than distributing it equally to all thermal molecules. As far as the parameter dependence is concerned, the vibrational relaxation data presented here appear analogous to VSC catalysis in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavities.

         <title>Novel Anthracycline Utorubicin for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utorubicin (UTO) is a novel anthracycline with higher anticancer activity than doxorubicin in cultured cancer cells. Nanoencapsulation of UTO in polymeric vesicles functionalized with tumor&#8208;penetrating peptides increases the cytotoxicity of the drug in receptor&#8208;positive cells in vitro and, after systemic administration into mice bearing triple&#8208;negative tumors, potentiates UTO accumulation in malignant tissue.







Abstract
Novel anticancer compounds and their precision delivery systems are actively developed to create potent and well&#8208;tolerated anticancer therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel anthracycline, Utorubicin (UTO), and its preclinical development as an anticancer payload for nanocarriers. Free UTO was significantly more toxic to cultured tumor cell lines than the clinically used anthracycline, doxorubicin. Nanoformulated UTO, encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes, PS), reduced the viability of cultured malignant cells and this effect was potentiated by functionalization with a tumor&#8208;penetrating peptide (TPP). Systemic peptide&#8208;guided PS showed preferential accumulation in triple&#8208;negative breast tumor xenografts implanted in mice. At the same systemic UTO dose, the highest UTO accumulation in tumor tissue was seen for the TPP&#8208;targeted PS, followed by nontargeted PS, and free doxorubicin. Our study suggests potential applications for UTO in the treatment of malignant diseases and encourages further preclinical and clinical studies on UTO as a nanocarrier payload for precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Branched Aggregates with Tunable Morphology via Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Azobenzene&#8208;Derived Molecular Double&#8208;Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly has been one of the most effective approach to fabricate nature&#8208;inspired materials with subtle nanostructures and variable functions. Herein, we report a distinct hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process of azobenzene&#8208;derived Janus molecular double&#8208;brushes (MDBs) with each graft site carrying a poly(azobenzene&#8208;acrylate) (PAzo) chain and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain. Asymmetric tapered&#8208;worm (ATW) nanostructures with chain&#8208;end reactivity assembling from the azobenzene&#8208;derived MDBs serve as primary subunits to prepare branched supermicelles by increasing water content (Cw) in THF/water, which is predominantly facilitated by the distinctive molecular brush architecture and the intermolecular interaction of PAzo brushes. Various natural antedon&#8208;shaped multiarm worm&#8208;like aggregates (MWAs) can be created depending on Cw&#160;via the particle&#8208;particle connection of ATWs. Intriguingly, the azobenzene moieties undergo  trans&#8208;cis  &#160;isomerization upon UV irradiation and further promote a morphology evolution of MWAs, leading the formation of starfish&#8208;shaped aggregates. Subsequently, multiscale luidia ciliaris and crossaster papposus&#8208;shaped supermicelles with different features of central body and arms are prepared by manipulating irradiation time.</dc:description>

         <title>Tight covalent organic framework membranes for efficient anion transport via molecular precursor engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membranes with tight structure, which can fully utilize well&#8208;defined framework structure and thus achieve superior conduction performance, remains a grand challenge. Herein, through molecular precursor engineering of COFs, we reported the fabrication of tight COFs membrane with the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity over 200 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C, 100% RH. Six quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized COFs were synthesized by assembling functional hydrazides and different aldehyde precursors. In an organic&#8208;aqueous reaction system, the impact of the aldehyde precursors with different size, electrophilicity and hydrophilicity on the reaction&#8208;diffusion process for fabricating COFs membranes was elucidated. Particularly, more hydrophilic aldehydes were prone to push the reaction zone from the interface region to the aqueous phase of the reaction system, the tight membranes were thus fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process, conferring around 4~8 times the anion conductivity over the loose membranes via interfacial polymerization process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrafine gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) are susceptible to migrate and aggregate, even in porosity of many crystalline solids.&#160; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a class of structurally diverse ligands for stabilization of Au&#8208;NCs in homogeneous chemistry, showing catalytic reactivity in CO  2  activation. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a heterogeneous nucleation approach to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters in a metal&#8208;free NHC&#8208;functionalized porous matrix. The sizes of gold nanoclusters are tunable from 1.3 nm to 1.8 nm based on the interpenetration of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) topology. Control experiments using amine or imidazolium&#8208;functionalized MOFs afforded aggregation of Au species. The resultant Au&#8208;NC@MOF composite exhibits steady and excellent activity in photocatalytic CO  2  reduction, superior to the control mixtures without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization.&#160; The mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic catalytic effect of MOFs and Au&#8208;NCs through the MOF&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au covalent bonding bridges.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and cellular labeling of multifunctional phosphatidylinositol bis&#8208; and trisphosphate derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized the first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo&#8208;removable protecting group (&#8220;cage&#8221;), a photo&#8208;crosslinkable diazirine group and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry. We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo&#8208;crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P  2  and PI(3,4,5)P  3  derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo&#8208;crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P  3  &#8208;binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P  3  to the plasma membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable fabrication of crystalline COF membrane from amorphous polymeric membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold tremendous potential for widespread applicability, but their scalable fabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation from amorphous polymeric membrane to crystalline COF membrane  via  monomer exchange. Solution&#8208;processing method is used to prepare amorphous membranes and the replacing monomer is selected based on the chemical and thermodynamical stability of the final framework. Afterwards, the reversible imine bonds allow the extraneous monomers to replace the pristine monomers within amorphous membrane, driving the transformation from disordered network to ordered framework. The incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds enables the crystalline COF to imprint the morphology of amorphous membrane. The COF membranes harvest proton conductivity up to 0.53 S cm  &#8722;1  at 80 &#176;C. Our strategy builds a bridge between amorphous polymeric and crystalline COF membranes, not only paving the way to large&#8208;scale fabrication of COF membranes, but also affording some guidance on materials processing via disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Reconfigurable DNA&#8208;Based Chemical Reaction Circuits for Soft Matter Computing and Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we developed pH&#8208;responsive DNA switching circuits for directing mechanical deformation of microgel swelling system through multiple chemical pathways of soft matter computing with chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
Developing smart material systems for performing different tasks in diverse environments remains challenging. Here, we show that by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials with multi&#8208;mode reconfigurable DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction circuits (D&#8208;CRCs), it can control size change of microgels with multiple reaction pathways and adapt expansion behaviors to meet diverse environments. We first use pH&#8208;responsive intramolecular conformational switches for regulating DNA strand displacement reactions (SDRs). The ability to regulate SDRs with tunable pH&#8208;dependence allows to build dynamic chemical reaction networks with diverse reaction pathways. We confirm that the designed DNA switching circuits are reconfigurable at different pH and perform different logic operations, and the swelling of DNA switching circuit&#8208;integrated microgel systems can be programmably directed by D&#8208;CRCs. Our approach provides insight into building smart responsive materials and fabricating autonomous soft robots.

         <title>Synthesis and Multiple Subsequent Reactivity of Anionic cyclo&#8208;E3 Ligand Complexes (E=P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of an intact cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand (E=P, As) from the nickel complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni(&#951;3&#8208;E3)] to the anionic cobalt complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; was achieved, which was afterwards quenched with main group electrophiles such as chlorophosphanes (R2PCl). That way, the E3 cycle can be expanded to a substituted four&#8208;membered ring, which undergoes further rearrangement processes by ring contractions to a cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit.







Abstract
A synthetic pathway for the synthesis of novel anionic sandwich complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand as an end deck was developed giving [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, E=P ([5]), As ([6])) in good yields suitable for further reactivity studies. In the reaction with the chlorophosphanes R2PCl (R=Ph, Cy, tBu), neutral complexes with a disubstituted cyclo&#8208;E3P (E=P, As) ligand in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (7&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (9&#8201;a&#8211;c)) were obtained. These compounds can be partially or completely converted into complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;2:&#951;1&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (8&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (10&#8201;a&#8211;c)). Additionally, the insertion of the chlorosilylene [LSiCl] (L=(tBuN)2CPh) into the cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand of [5] and [6] was achieved and the novel heteroatomic complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3SiL)] (E=P (11), As (12)) could be isolated. The reaction pathway was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bis(silylenyl) ortho&#8208;dicarborane&#8208;supported zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (germylone) 1 undergoes facile dimerization with Ge&#8722;Ge bond formation upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction to furnish the bis(silylene)&#8208;supported dicationic and dianionic [GeI&#8211;GeI] complexes 2 and 3, respectively. A neutral complex 4 bearing a Ge22+ dumbbell embedded in a shell of two radical&#8208;anionic di&#8208; (silylenyl)dicarborane ligands could be synthesized.

Using the chelating C,C&#8242;&#8208;bis(silylenyl)&#8208;ortho&#8208;dicarborane ligand, 1,2&#8208;(RSi)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 [R=PhC(NtBu)2], leads to the monoatomic zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (&#8220;germylone&#8221;) 3. The redox non&#8208;innocent character of the carborane scaffold has a drastic influence on the reactivity of 3 towards reductants and oxidants. Reduction of 3 with one molar equivalent of potassium naphthalenide (KC10H8) causes facile oxidation of Ge0 to GeI along with a two&#8208;electron reduction of the C2B10 cluster core and subsequent GeI&#8208;GeI coupling to form the dianionic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 4. In contrast, oxidation of 3 with one molar equivalent of [Cp2Fe][B{C6H3(CF3)2}4] as a one&#8208;electron oxidant furnishes the dicationic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 5. The Ge0 atom in 3 acts as donor towards GeCl2 to form the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valent Ge0&#8594;GeII&#8592;Ge0 complex 6, from which dechlorination with KC10H8 affords the neutral Ge2 complex 7 as a diradical species.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation is one of the most powerful methods for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds. However, the chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of the relatively inert unsaturated group in substrates possessing multiple unsaturated bonds remains a challenge. We herein report a protocol for the highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes while keeping the alkynyl bond intact. Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn  2+  generated from zinc reduction of the Co  II  complex plays a critical role to initiate a plausible Co  I  /Co  III  catalytic cycle. This approach allows for the highly efficient generation of chiral propargylamines (up to 99.9% ee and 2000 S/C) and further useful chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesizing Photoluminescent Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 Nanoclusters with Feature Structures by Using A Joint Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters are currently widely researched; however, some fundamental studies, such as studies to improve the understanding of the kernel evolution pattern and structural photoluminescence, are far from complete due to the limitations of the synthesis method. Herein, we introduced a novel strategy&#8722;the joint of the current synthesis methods for atomically precise nanocluster synthesis. As an illustration, we introduced the reducing&#8208;ligand induction joint method and synthesized a novel nanocluster, which was determined to be Au  28  (SCH  2  Ph&#8208;  t  Bu)  22  with the same number of gold atoms as existing Au  28  (SR)  20  nanoclusters but different ligands (hetero&#8208;staple&#8208;homo&#8208;size). Compared with the latter, the former has distinct properties and structures. In particular, a novel kernel evolution pattern was first reported, i.e., the quasi&#8208;linear growth of Au  4  &#8208;tetrahedron by sharing one vertex and feature structures, including a tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two Au  6  (SCH  2  Ph&#8208;  t  Bu)  6  hexamer chair&#8208;like rings on the kernel surface were also first reported, which endow Au  28  (SCH  2  Ph&#8208;  t  Bu)  22  with the best photoluminescence quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably due to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8208;Au bonds.</dc:description>
