         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Regeneration of Spent LiFePO4 Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a redox&#8208;mediated electrochemical method for direct recycling of spent LiFePO4 battery cathodes. A water&#8208;soluble mediator, iron propylenediamine tetraacetate (Fe&#8208;PDTA), transports electrons into an off&#8208;electrode reservoir where it drives compositional and structural repair of degraded LiFePO4. This process achieves current densities up to 100&#160;mA/cm2 and regenerates LiFePO4 with performance comparable to pristine material.








ABSTRACT
Direct recycling of lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes offers considerable appeal over metallurgical approaches. Here, we demonstrate a mediated electrochemical method for direct regeneration of degraded LiFePO4 (LFP). The approach uses a redox mediator, iron propylenediamine tetraacetate, that undergoes electrochemical reduction and is circulated through an external reservoir, where it supplies the electrons needed to regenerate LFP in the presence of Li+ ions derived from LiOH oxidation. Rapid outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer is observed from the mediator to the degraded LFP material. This feature, together with good aqueous solubility of the mediator (0.3&#160;M), supports current densities up to 100&#160;mA/cm2, and this electrochemical recycling process is demonstrated on 100&#160;g scale. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy is used to monitor the correction of structural defects in the degraded LFP, providing the basis for regeneration of LFP that matches the electrochemical performance of pristine LFP.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates a redox-mediated electrochemical method for direct recycling of spent LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; battery cathodes. A water-soluble mediator, iron propylenediamine tetraacetate (Fe-PDTA), transports electrons into an off-electrode reservoir where it drives compositional and structural repair of degraded LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This process achieves current densities up to 100&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and regenerates LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with performance comparable to pristine material.

         <title>Product Ligand&#8208;Modification on Ni(OH)2 for Boosted Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Aromatic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The development of active electrocatalysts for converting biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols into value&#8208;added acids is of great significance. Ni(OH)2 has been employed as a cost&#8208;effective catalyst, unfortunately, suffering from rather low catalytic activity due to the considerable energy barrier to transform into active NiOOH and the weak interaction with reactants. To address these limitations, a novel &#8220;product ligand&#8208;modification&#8221; (PLM) strategy has been proposed here simply by adopting the target molecule ligands as modification units, which simultaneously facilitates the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox kinetics and significantly enriches reactants at the catalytic surface via profound &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction. The PLM strategy has been demonstrated to exhibit exceptionally high performance in electro&#8208;oxidizing aromatic alcohols into corresponding acids across various product ligand&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (PL&#8208;Ni(OH)2) catalysts. As a typical paradigm, the aromatic ligand FDCA&#8208;modified Ni(OH)2 catalyst (termed FDCA&#8208;Ni(OH)2) demonstrates significantly enhanced BHMF electrocatalytic oxidation activity, featuring a BHMF conversion rate of &gt;99.4%, FDCA selectivity and yield of 99.2% and 98.6%, and Faradaic efficiency of 99.0%. Furthermore, FDCA&#8208;Ni(OH)2 features an excellent stability for over 250&#160;h in a flow electrolyzer to produce FDCA with a &gt;99.0% purity. This PLM strategy offers valuable insights into the performance enhancement of Ni(OH)2 catalyst for the targeted conversion of aromatic reactants.

         <title>A Modular Approach to N&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Amides via Nitrene Insertion Into Fluoroalkylcopper(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper/nitrene&#8208;mediated, modular three&#8208;component protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl compounds was described. This method enables the first synthesis and pharmaceutical characterization of acyclic amides featuring N&#8211;C2F5 and N&#8211;CF2CO2Et groups, which are structures previously unreported in the literature. The isolation and structural elucidation of an [CuIN(CF3)(COAr)] copper complex, the first metal complex coordinated by an N&#8211;CF3 group, provides direct evidence supporting the proposed mechanism. Leveraging the diverse reactivity of copper, this platform is expected to facilitate access to a broader range of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl architectures.








ABSTRACT
We report herein the first copper&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component modular synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl amides from fluoroalkylcopper species ([CuI&#9472;CF3], [CuI&#9472;CF2CO2Et], and [CuI&#9472;C2F5]), a nitrene precursor (dioxazolone), and an electrophile, featuring broad substrate scope and the unprecedented construction of acyclic N&#8208;C2F5 and N&#8208;CF2CO2Et structures. The reaction proceeds via reaction of the dioxazolone with the fluoroalkylcopper complex to generate a nitrene/Cu intermediate, followed by nitrene migratory insertion into the [CuI&#9472;CRf] bond as the pivotal step that directly forges the N&#8211;fluoroalkyl bond. Such a key step was supported by isolation and single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray characterization of intermediates [(L1)CuIN(CF3)(COAr)] 5c and [CuI(N(CF3)(COAr))2]&#8722; 5d. Leveraging the versatile reactivity of copper, these intermediates react with various electrophiles to access a wide range of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl(aryl)amides, and the derivatization of several drug molecules further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this approach.

         <title>Discovering the pH&#8208;independent Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Formation via Direct Mn&#8208;oxo Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding O&#9472;O bond formation on metal&#8208;oxo species is key to elucidating catalytic oxidation processes. By tuning the connectivity of [MnO6] octahedra, this study reveals a pH&#8208;independent mechanism for direct O&#9472;O bond coupling through Mn&#8722;O in edge&#8208;shared structures. This pathway differs fundamentally from traditional nucleophilic water attack, offering a blueprint for designing efficient artificial catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Unraveling the mechanism of O&#9472;O bond formation on metal&#8208;oxo is critical yet remains a central challenge in electrocatalytic water oxidation.

Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses reveal that Mn&#8208;edge exhibits an unprecedented pH&#8208;independent evolution of O2. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and in situ Raman spectroscopy identify a direct coupling mechanism between Mn&#8722;O species in Mn&#8208;edge, bypassing the conventional nucleophilic water attack. Density functional theory calculations further support that Mn&#8208;oxo coupling between asymmetric MnVI&#160;&#8764;&#160;MnV centers drastically reduces the energy barrier for O&#9472;O bond formation. These findings establish the connectivity of [MnO6] as a critical descriptor for water oxidation mechanism and offer a new design strategy for efficient catalysts inspired by natural oxygen&#8208;evolving complexes.

&lt;p&gt;Understanding O&#9472;O bond formation on metal-oxo species is key to elucidating catalytic oxidation processes. By tuning the connectivity of [MnO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] octahedra, this study reveals a pH-independent mechanism for direct O&#9472;O bond coupling through Mn&#8722;O in edge-shared structures. This pathway differs fundamentally from traditional nucleophilic water attack, offering a blueprint for designing efficient artificial catalysts.

         <title>Imidazolium Cation&#8208;Stabilized Interfacial Chemistry for Durable Aqueous Cadmium&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous cadmium&#8208;iodine (Cd//I2) battery is constructed through interfacial chemistry regulation. The cadmium anode effectively suppresses parasitic hydrogen evolution and enhances anode stability, while the incorporation of BMIM+ additives anchors polyiodide species, alleviating the polyiodide shuttle effect and reinforcing interfacial robustness. Benefiting from this dual regulation, the Cd//I2 battery delivers high capacity and ultralong cycling stability, demonstrating the promising potential of aqueous Cd metal batteries.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous metal batteries are attractive candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical application is constrained by dendrite growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as dissolution&#8208;induced parasitic reactions of the cathode materials. Here, we report a durable cadmium&#8208;iodine (Cd//I2) battery enabled by a dual&#8208;interfacial chemistry regulation strategy. The Cd2+/Cd redox couple offers moderate potential to suppress HER and strong resistance to acidic and polyiodide corrosion, rendering Cd metal a highly stable anode. Moreover, the incorporation of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (BMIM+) induces preferential adsorption on the Cd anode, forming a functional interphase that lowers local charge density, suppresses dendrite growth, and promotes uniform Cd deposition. At the cathode, strong electrostatic interactions and steric hindrance between BMIM+ and polyiodide anions effectively mitigate the shuttle effect. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the Cd//I2 battery delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 152.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 and achieves ultralong cycling stability over 50,000 cycles, with an ultralow per&#8208;cycle capacity decay of 0.00032%. Even under a high I2 loading of 17.78&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the battery maintains 400 cycles with high specific capacity of 173.1 mAh g&#8722;1, underscoring its potential for practical application.

         <title>The Important Role of Carbonyl in Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Selenium&#8208;Based Organoboron Narrowband Blue Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl and selenium embedded organoboron emitters are developed with a modulated short&#8208;distance CT transition that preserves narrowband blue emission while boosting the kRISC over 107 s&#8722;1 and shortening the delayed fluorescence lifetimes to 2.4&#160;&#181;s. Such ultrafast exciton utilization is versatile for OLED applications, including non&#8208;sensitized blue OLED and bi&#8208;color white OLED, rendering excellent EQEmax beyond 30% and suppressed roll&#8208;offs.








ABSTRACT
Narrowband emissive polycyclic aromatic heterocycles (PAHs) featuring multiple resonance thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) are capable of achieving high color purity with high exciton utilization efficiency via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). However, thermally&#8208;activated RISC remains the rate&#8208;limiting step in MR&#8208;TADF molecules due to the typically large singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and weak spin&#8208;orbital coupling. To overcome this challenge, we introduce three carbonyl&#8208;containing organoboron PAHs doped with selenium atoms (pSeXBNO, 1pSeXBN, and pSeXBN) for the first time. Introducing single or dual selenium&#8208;embedded carbonyl heterocycles into the MR core enables significant orbital delocalization of carbonyls, resulting in small &#916;EST and ultrafast RISC rates of 7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 for pSeXBNO, 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for 1pSeXBN, and 4.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for pSeXBN. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED employing pSeXBN achieves an emission peak at 478&#160;nm with a narrow bandwidth of 28&#160;nm, along with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.6% and retaining 28.4% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for blue MR&#8208;TADF materials. Moreover, bi&#8208;color white OLED employing pSeXBN exhibits excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 30.9% and 23.2% retained at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. These advances demonstrate the role of carbonyl here is of significant guidance in forwarding narrowband blue materials.

         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pBzF) integrates genetic code expansion with benzophenone photochemistry to enable proximity&#8208;based labeling, programmable biocatalysis, and biosafe microbial engineering, all from a single, site&#8208;specifically encoded amino acid.








ABSTRACT
p&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pBzF) is a widely used noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) that expands the chemical repertoire of proteins. Its benzophenone (BP) chromophore undergoes near&#8208;quantitative intersystem crossing (ISC) to a triplet state, furnishing a highly efficient, site&#8208;addressable photoreactive handle. Beyond photochemistry, the bulky, hydrophobic side chain introduces distinct steric and electronic effects that enable new reactivity in protein active sites. Genetic incorporation of pBzF in vivo, including directed evolution, has unlocked applications ranging from site&#8208;specific photo&#8208;crosslinking for interaction mapping to engineering antibody fragments, sharpening monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitope recognition, and creating protein&#8208;based photocatalysts. pBzF has also proved powerful for mechanistic studies by stabilizing short&#8208;lived intermediates. More recently, pBzF&#8208;containing proteins have been leveraged in light&#8208;driven transformations, including [2+2] photocycloadditions, deracemizations, and dehalogenations, and in the construction of artificial photosynthetic systems. This review critically discusses these advances and establishes pBzF as a versatile photochemical and structural motif for building proteins with non&#8208;natural, light&#8208;responsive, and catalytically competent functions.

         <title>Harnessing Controlled Dealloying&#8211;Support Coupling for Ultrastable PtNi Catalysts in PEMFC Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable alloying&#8211;dealloying strategy constructs PtNi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles confined within an N&#8208;doped carbon framework. Selective ammonia&#8208;assisted dealloying forms a Pt&#8208;rich shell while immobilizing Ni as Ni&#8211;N/C moieties, synergistically stabilizing the catalyst.

Platinum&#8211;transition metal (PtM) alloys are among the most promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, yet their practical deployment in proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is hindered by transition&#8208;metal dissolution, particle coarsening, and insufficient durability. Moreover, conventional alloying or intermetallic ordering strategies often aggravate these issues by inducing severe nanoparticle aggregation and instability. Here we report a controllable alloying&#8211;dealloying strategy to construct PtNi nanoparticles confined in an N&#8208;doped carbon framework (Pt1Ni1&#8208;x@Nix_NC). Ammonia&#8208;assisted dealloying produces a Pt&#8208;rich shell with an alloyed core, while the N&#8208;doped carbon anchors the released Ni atoms form Ni&#8211;N/C moieties, thereby suppressing agglomeration and strengthening metal&#8211;support interactions. This coordination&#8211;support coupling optimizes Pt 5d orbital occupation, weakens oxygen adsorption, and accelerates ORR kinetics. Consequently, Pt1Ni1&#8208;x@Nix_NC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.932&#160;V and an ultrahigh mass activity of 2.028 A mgPt&#8722;1, which is 8.75&#8208;fold higher than commercial Pt/C and among the best values reported to date for PtNi&#8208;based catalysts. Remarkably, it shows only a 6&#160;mV half&#8208;wave potential loss after 30,000 cycles, demonstrating exceptional durability. In PEMFCs, the fuel cell delivers 975&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density and retains 91.9% of initial performance, underscoring a generalizable approach for designing durable, high&#8208;performance low&#8208;PGM catalysts for next generation PEMFCs.

&lt;p&gt;A controllable alloying&#8211;dealloying strategy constructs PtNi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles confined within an N-doped carbon framework. Selective ammonia-assisted dealloying forms a Pt-rich shell while immobilizing Ni as Ni&#8211;N/C moieties, synergistically stabilizing the catalyst. The resulting structure delivers exceptional ORR activity and durable, high-power performance in practical PEM fuel cells.

         <title>Remote Positioning of Cations Tunes Catalytic Fe&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Fixation Selectivity for Hydrazine Instead of Ammonia in Protic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;guided design enables selective Fe&#8208;catalyzed N2 reduction to hydrazine in methanol. Incorporating remote cationic (NMe3+) or proton&#8208;responsive (NMe2) groups into a tris(phosphino)borane ligand anodically shifts the redox potential of selectivity determining Fe&#8208;hydrazido species (FeNNH2) to access the reduced state (FeNNH2&#8722;), leading to favorable hydrazine formation over ammonia.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the basis of product selectivity is a central issue in catalyst design. Catalytic nitrogen reduction (N2R) provides a salient example; whereas ammonia (NH3) is the common product of N2R, hydrazine (N2H4) is produced under certain conditions. Using mechanism&#8208;guided design, we report a strategy for tuning redox potential that enables selective reduction of dinitrogen to hydrazine by iron complexes in polar protic media. Incorporation of cationic trimethylammonium (NMe3+) or proton&#8208;responsive dimethylamino (NMe2) groups into a tris(phosphino)borane (P3B) ligand framework affords redox&#8208;tunable iron precatalysts that operate efficiently in methanol. Computational analyses reveal that these ligand modifications anodically shift the reduction potential of an iron hydrazido (Fe&#9552;NNH2) intermediate by &gt;400&#160;mV, thereby influencing the key branch point for hydrazine versus ammonia. Critical to success is positioning the cationic charges remote from the Fe&#8211;N2 binding site to preserve the high degree of N2 activation required for functionalization. Newly prepared tricationic iron complexes, soluble and stable in polar protic media, catalyze N2R with N&#8208;fixed yields of up to 73% per reducing equivalent consumed, and with hydrazine selectivity exceeding 20:1 over ammonia. This work highlights the use of remote electrostatic effects to tune multi&#8208;electron catalytic product profiles from a 6e&#8211; to a 4e&#8211; product.

         <title>Electrooxidative C&#8208;C Fragmentation of Aromatic Radical Cations for Cascade Benzylic Multifunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Selective Electrooxidative C&#8208;C Fragmentation of Aromatic Radical Cations for Cascade Benzylic Multifunctionalization by Iterative Dehydrogenation and Oxygenation Was Reported. Central to Our Approach Is the Controlled Formation of Olefin Intermediates in Situ at a Rate Carefully Balanced to Prevent Polymerization and Overoxidation. This Strategy Provides Efficient Access to Diverse, High&#8208;value Di&#8208; or Trifunctionalized Products through Judicious Choice of Acids and Nucleophiles.








ABSTRACT
Oxygen, nitrogen, and halogen&#8208;containing functional groups are ubiquitous in complex small molecules. The installation of multiple carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds by the simultaneous functionalization of contiguous C&#8211;H/C&#8211;C bonds in a selective fashion is highly desirable in polymers degradation, skeletal editing, and petroleum cracking. However, achieving simultaneous, multi&#8208;site functionalization of relatively inert C&#8211;C/C&#8211;H bonds with precise control over site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and oxidation&#8208;state selectivity remains challenging, particularly due to competing overoxidation and decomposition. Here we report the electrooxidative selective C&#8208;C fragmentation of aromatic radical cations for cascade benzylic di&#8208; and trifunctionalization in simple alkylarenes by iterative dehydrogenation and oxygenation. Central to our approach is the controlled formation of olefin intermediates in situ at a rate carefully balanced to prevent polymerization and overoxidation. This strategy provides efficient access to diverse, high&#8208;value di&#8208; or trifunctionalized products, including di&#8208; and triacetates, 2&#8208;oxazolines, 1,2&#8208;dibromoethanes, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2&#8208;ols, and 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)oxiranes via controlled 4&#8208;electron, 6&#8208;electron, or 10&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, the selective synthesis of di&#8208; versus trifunctionalization products is readily controlled through judicious choice of acids and nucleophiles.

         <title>Tuning Redox Behavior of Pyrene&#8211;Benzothiadiazole/TTF&#8211;Based Covalent Organic Framework Electrodes in Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

We report a novel, highly crystalline 2D PyTTF&#8208;COF, synthesized by integrating n&#8208;type pyrene&#8211;benzothiadiazole (PyBT) and p&#8208;type tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) subunits via an n&#8208;type imine linkage, yielding a bipolar electrode capable of reversible 16&#160;e&#8722; dual cation&#8211;anion storage. This study elucidates the intricate interdependence between the structural architecture of the COF and the electrolyte environment, which collectively govern the electrochemical behavior of the bipolar&#8208;type COF electrode and, consequently, the overall rate&#8208;performance of the dual&#8208;ion batteries. 








ABSTRACT
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for secondary&#8208;ion batteries, where redox&#8208;active building blocks and linkages enable tunable redox properties, while ordered pores serve as nanochannels for fast ion transport. We report a novel highly crystalline 2D PyTTF&#8208;COF, synthesized by integrating n&#8208;type pyrene&#8211;benzothiadiazole (PyBT) and p&#8208;type tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) subunits via an n&#8208;type imine linkage, yielding a bipolar electrode capable of reversible 16&#160;e&#8722; dual cation&#8211;anion storage. Initially, the dual&#8208;ion, redox synergy was tested in a Li&#8208;ion half&#8208;cell, where PyTTF served as cathode, and 1&#160;&#1084;&#160;LiPF6 or LiTFSI electrolytes were employed to probe anion&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior. Electrochemical evaluation in Li&#8208;ion half cells revealed a wide electrochemical window of 0.1&#8722;3.6&#160;V vs. Li/Li+, with markedly enhanced charge&#8208;storage kinetics and ion diffusion with LiTFSI relative to LiPF6 electrolytes. The PyTTF electrode delivered specific capacities of 286&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (LiTFSI) and 184&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (LiPF6) at 0.3&#160;A g&#8722;1, highlighting the strong influence of anion identity. Systematic variation of LiTFSI salt concentration (1&#8722;3&#160;&#1084;) revealed strong correlations between electrolyte composition, ion storage dynamics, and interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance. This study highlights, for the first time, the critical importance of tailoring both charge&#8208;carrier identity and electrolyte concentration to unlock the full potential of bipolar COF electrodes for dual&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Surface&#8208;State&#8211;Regulated Product Distribution in Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation Over MXene&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes an MXene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in which the cooperative interplay among metallic Ni, surface NiOx domains, and conductive Ti3C2Clx drives efficient charge separation and photothermal coupling. Progressive evolution of Ni surface states regulates the CH4/CH3OH product distribution by modulating interfacial energetics and hydrogenation pathways, enabling effective photothermal CO2 conversion.








ABSTRACT
The rational design of heterostructured photocatalysts that simultaneously enable efficient carrier separation, photothermal synergy, and controllable reaction pathways is crucial for advancing CO2 conversion. Here, a Ni/Ti3C2Clx MXene heterojunction is synthesized via Lewis acid molten&#8208;salt etching, featuring ultrathin Ni platelets strongly anchored to the MXene substrate through interfacial TiNi3 bonding. This architecture establishes an S&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway, as evidenced by in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, which confirm efficient carrier transfer and separation, while femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals ultrafast interfacial dynamics. Under photothermal conditions, the cooperative interplay of metallic Ni, surface NiOx, and the conductive MXene substrate couples directional charge migration with thermally assisted molecular activation and barrier lowering, thereby enabling regulated CO2 hydrogenation product distribution between CH4 and CH3OH. Density functional theory demonstrates that surface&#8208;state evolution, rather than simple oxidation degree, modulates adsorption energetics and alters the relative barriers of CH4 and CH3OH pathways, such that moderately oxidized Ni&#8211;NiOx interfacial ensembles favour methanol forming intermediates, whereas extensive oxidation suppresses CH3OH formation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a robust strategy for exploiting MXene&#8208;based heterojunction interfaces in photothermal catalysis and underscore the pivotal role of surface state regulated reaction pathways in steering product distribution during CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;One&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Single Crystals Enabling Decoupled Ionic&#8211;Electronic Transport for Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational perovskite structural design, a novel quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite was developed featuring five&#8208;layer&#8208;thick inorganic chain inorganic chains, enabling efficient carrier transport and suppressed ion migration. The polymer&#8211;perovskite approach provides a reliable connection between the tablet and the thin&#8208;film transistor, resulting in sensitive and stable x&#8208;ray detection and imaging.








ABSTRACT
Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for low&#8208;cost and sensitive x&#8208;ray detection. However, the existing perovskite materials with diverse composition and dimensionality encounter an intrinsictrade&#8208;off between carrier collection and ion migration, posing a critical challenge for high&#8208;energy x&#8208;ray detection. Here, we demonstrated that the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite of cystamine lead iodide featuring corner&#8208;sharing [Pb5I22] chains chain and small interchain spacing along edge&#8208;on orientation enables efficient carrier collection and blocked ion migration simultaneously, and thus largely decouple the electronic and ionic transport pathways. The as&#8208;grown single crystals yield a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 4.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1, and a high activation energy for ion migration of 0.94&#160;eV. Therefore, an impressive x&#8208;ray sensitivity of 1.42&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (average x&#8208;ray energy 42.7&#160;keV) are obtained in quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite. Under harsh conditions, such as continuous radiation, high electric fields, and high temperatures, the device exhibits excellent operational stability. As a proof of concept, the robust integration of a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with a thin&#8208;film transistor backplane for x&#8208;ray imaging was achieved. This study offers innovative insights into the regulate the structural dimensions of materials for sensitive and stable x&#8208;ray detection.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Short&#8208;Chain Perfluoroalkyl Substances by Cavity&#8208;Directed Aggregation in a Molecular Cage Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cage exhibits strong entropy&#8208;driven encapsulation of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), accommodating up to four short&#8208;chain guests as anionic aggregates. Guided by these molecular&#8208;level insights, a novel host&#8208;in&#8208;host adsorbent is developed: mesoporous silica doped with 1 wt% cage achieves &gt;98% removal of short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain PFAS with full regenerability under flow&#8208;through conditions.








ABSTRACT
The removal of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water is critical to protect human health and the environment. However, removing short&#8208;chain PFAS remains a significant challenge, and a molecular&#8208;level understanding of their binding is lacking. Here, we utilise a metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC 1) as a model &#8220;pore&#8221; to elucidate the host&#8208;guest chemistry of short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain PFAS in water. X&#8208;ray crystallography of six 1&#183;(PFAS)n complexes reveals a broad range of PFAS are encapsulated as anionic aggregates, with the degree of guest&#8208;guest aggregation decreasing as the fluoroalkyl chain length increases. 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy, together with isothermal titration calorimetry reveal the cage host displays unusually large, entropy&#8208;driven association constants in water (log K &#8805; &#8197;5) which remain high for short&#8208;chain PFAS. Doping mesoporous silica 60A with only &#8764;1 wt% of the cage results in a host&#8208;in&#8208;host adsorbent that removes &gt;98% of short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations under flow&#8208;through conditions. The adsorbent exhibits rapid PFAS uptake with high selectivity over common water&#8208;borne anions and full regenerability. These findings translate host&#8208;guest chemistry into an effective materials platform for PFAS remediation, including short&#8208;chain species that evade conventional removal methods.

         <title>Multifaceted Molecular Design Enables Comprehensive Luminescence Modulation in Metalloligand&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridentate phosphine ligand (NP3) was employed for the first time in the synthesis of metalloligand&#8208;stabilized coinage metal nanoclusters with an unprecedented multi&#8208;sphere configuration of &#8220;Au9M4 (M = Au or Cu) icosahedron + Au3 crown&#8221;. Multifaceted regulation of TADF properties and emission performance was achieved both experimentally and theoretically through Cu&#8208;doping, ligand modification, and coordinating anion substitution. These nanoclusters further exhibit proton&#8208;responsive reversible photoluminescence modulation with protonation&#8208;induced enhancement and deprotonation&#8208;induced quenching.








ABSTRACT
Photoluminescent metal nanoclusters hold promise for optoelectronics, photonics, and chemosensing, yet systematic modulation of their emission within a single system remains challenging. Here, we report two isostructural clusters, Au13@Au3&#8208;Cl and Au9Cu4@Au3&#8208;Cl, stabilized by a tridentate phosphine (NP3) metalloligand. Both adopt an unprecedented &#8220;Au9M4 (Au/Cu) icosahedron + Au3 crown&#8221; configuration and exhibit high solid&#8208;state PLQYs of 44.5% and 38.9%, respectively. In contrast, replacing NP3 with a monophosphine ligand (BPP) affords Au9Cu4&#8208;Cl lacking the Au3 crown, with a dramatically reduced PLQY of 0.6%, highlighting the crucial roles of NP3 and the Au3 crown in boosting luminescence. Distinct photophysical behaviors are observed: Au13@Au3&#8208;Cl shows phosphorescence, while Au9Cu4@Au3&#8208;Cl exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The role of Cu doping is further supported by the TADF activity of Au9Cu4&#8208;Cl. Coordinating anion substitution also modulates emission, with iodide promoting TADF in Au13@Au3&#8208;I. Moreover, the NP3 ligand confers reversible protonation&#8208;induced luminescence switching, enabling chemosensing potential. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a comprehensive investigation of TADF behavior and luminescence modulation in atomically precise metal nanoclusters, systematically engineered through heteroatom doping of the inner core, ligand design and anion exchange at the coordination surface, and outer&#8208;sphere complexation and protonation.

     alt="Multifaceted Molecular Design Enables Comprehensive Luminescence Modulation in Metalloligand-Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tridentate phosphine ligand (NP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was employed for the first time in the synthesis of metalloligand-stabilized coinage metal nanoclusters with an unprecedented multi-sphere configuration of &#8220;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Au or Cu) icosahedron + Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crown&#8221;. Multifaceted regulation of TADF properties and emission performance was achieved both experimentally and theoretically through Cu-doping, ligand modification, and coordinating anion substitution. These nanoclusters further exhibit proton-responsive reversible photoluminescence modulation with protonation-induced enhancement and deprotonation-induced quenching.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoluminescent metal nanoclusters hold promise for optoelectronics, photonics, and chemosensing, yet systematic modulation of their emission within a single system remains challenging. Here, we report two isostructural clusters, &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;@Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;/b&gt;, stabilized by a tridentate phosphine (NP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) metalloligand. Both adopt an unprecedented &#8220;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Au/Cu) icosahedron + Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crown&#8221; configuration and exhibit high solid-state PLQYs of 44.5% and 38.9%, respectively. In contrast, replacing NP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with a monophosphine ligand (BPP) affords &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;/b&gt; lacking the Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crown, with a dramatically reduced PLQY of 0.6%, highlighting the crucial roles of NP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crown in boosting luminescence. Distinct photophysical behaviors are observed: &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;@Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;/b&gt; shows phosphorescence, while &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;/b&gt; exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The role of Cu doping is further supported by the TADF activity of &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;/b&gt;. Coordinating anion substitution also modulates emission, with iodide promoting TADF in &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;@Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-I&lt;/b&gt;.

         <title>Metal Node Guided Pore Engineering in Carborane&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal node guided pore engineering strategy in carborane&#8208;based MOFs was developed, leading to the creation of Co&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA with partitioned dual cage system for efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separations.








ABSTRACT
The efficient separation of C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures is essential for the preparation of high&#8208;purity C2H2 and C2H4, but challenged by the trade&#8208;off between the capacity and selectivity. In this work, we report a node guided pore engineering strategy in carborane&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to the partitioned dual cage system in Co&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA in contrast to its analogue Zn&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA with one&#8208;dimensional channels. This structural evolution endows Co&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA with a high C2H2 adsorption capacity of 103.2 cm3/g (4.61 mmol/g) at 298 K and 1 bar, along with superior selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (10.6) and C2H2/C2H4 (13.3). Breakthrough experiments confirm its excellent separation performance for both mixtures under varied conditions, demonstrating efficient recovery of high&#8208;purity C2H2 and C2H4 with remarkable cyclic stability and humidity tolerance. The separation mechanism is elucidated by DFT calculations and in situ single&#8208;crystal&#8208;ray diffraction, which reveal enhanced binding interactions within the partitioned cages through multiple van der Waals contacts, rationalizing the high selectivity.

         <title>Influence of Positional Isomerism in Weakly Solvating Ethers on Lithium Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that Li&#8208;ion electrolytes with asymmetric ethers exhibit faster charge&#8208;transfer kinetics at negatievely polarized interfaces than symmetric ethers with similar Carbon/Oxygen ratios. This arises from a tilted dipole and conformational changes that reduce solvation shielding and ease Li+ transfer. In contrast, Li metal deposition favors symmetric ethers and scales linearly with ion pairing and LiF, not Li2O in the SEI.








ABSTRACT
Lithium metal is a promising anode for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries but faces issues like internal short circuits and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), limiting its performance. Although factors like solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, charge transfer resistance, solvation structure, and solvent symmetry influence Li metal deposition, a unified descriptor remains absent. Here, we systematically investigate three positional isomers of weakly solvating ether solvents&#8212;dipropyl ether (DPE), butyl ethyl ether (BEE), and pentyl methyl ether (PME), selected to maintain the same C/O (carbon/oxygen) ratio of 6, allowing isolation of minor structural variations on Li metal deposition. By correlating charge transfer kinetics, solvation structure, SEI composition, and lithium microstructure with electrochemical performance, we identify key factors influencing deposition. The symmetric ether, DPE, with sluggish charge transfer kinetics and the most pronounced ion pairing, achieved the highest CE of 99.26%, followed by BEE (99.24%) and PME (98.89%). Increased ion pairing and enhanced LiF content in the SEI were found to have the strongest linear correlation with interfacial stability as reflected in CE. These findings challenge previous studies that faster charge transfer kinetics led to improved CE and enhance the understanding of designing weakly solvating ethers with optimized oxygen placement for future Li metal batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrolytes Govern Tetrahydroxozincate Dynamics for Stable Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research tackles the limitations of alkaline zinc batteries by designing a series of metalloporphyrin molecules (Co&#8208;4N, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;S) as electrolyte additives. The asymmetric structures, particularly Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O, accelerate the Zn(OH)42&#8722; decomposition via a modulated metal center and control Zn2+ transport through carboxyl groups. This approach enables the stable cycles of 80,000 s at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It demonstrates a molecular solution to challenges in aqueous battery chemistry. 








ABSTRACT
Green electrochemical energy storage is essential for carbon neutrality, and alkaline zinc batteries offer a compelling solution due to their inherent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, their performance is limited by parasitic reactions, including corrosion, gas evolution, and slow Zn/ZnO conversion kinetics stemming from inefficient dissociation of the tetrahydroxozincate [Zn(OH)42&#8722;] intermediate. We address this by designing a series of cobalt porphyrins (Co&#8208;4N, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;S) that modulate the metal center's charge density for accelerating Zn(OH)42&#8722; decomposition, and control Zn2+ transport through the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized peripheries. The Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O&#8208;modified electrolyte achieves exceptional stability, maintaining stable cycle for over 80,000 s at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is more than four times longer than the &lt;20,000 s achieved by the conventional KOH + ZnO electrolyte. In Zn||Ni batteries, this molecularly engineered electrolyte enables 110 stable cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the unmodified system, which sustained only 20 cycles. These findings elucidate a structure&#8208;kinetics relationship for zincate regulation and demonstrate how customized molecular asymmetry can overcome persistent challenges in aqueous battery chemistry, offering a pathway to high&#8208;performance, durable energy storage systems.

         <title>Meltable Semiconductive Lead&#8211;Thiolate Coordination Polymers with Long Alkyl Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first meltable semiconducting Pb(II)&#8208;benzenethiolate coordination polymer, KGF&#8208;34(C6). It exhibits higher charge mobility, a narrower bandgap, and greater band dispersion than classical Pb(II)&#8208;alkanethiolate coordination polymers. Furthermore, KGF&#8208;34(C6) melts, enabling melt&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices.








ABSTRACT
Meltable organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors are attractive for their potential for melt&#8208;based processing. Although meltable semiconducting metal halide perovskites have been extensively studied, meltable semiconducting coordination polymers (CPs) remain scarce, despite their excellent structural designability and the tunability of their optoelectronic properties. We report a new family of meltable semiconductive Pb(II) benzenethiolate CPs bearing long alkyl chains, formulated as [Pb(SPhOC6)2]n (KGF&#8208;34(C6); HSPhOC6 = 4&#8208;hexyloxybenzenethiol). For comparison, we also synthesized the classical analogue [Pb(SC6)2]n (KGF&#8208;59(C6); HSC6 = 1&#8208;hexanethiol). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that both KGF&#8208;34(C6) and KGF&#8208;59(C6) adopt 2D architectures, albeit with distinct inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks. A comprehensive characterization of the semiconducting properties, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, revealed that KGF&#8208;34(C6) exhibits significantly higher photoconductivity, a narrower band gap, and a larger band dispersion than KGF&#8208;59(C6), attributable to differences in their inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n network structures. Furthermore, both KGF&#8208;34(C6) and KGF&#8208;59(C6) exhibit multiple phase transitions, including melting and liquid crystalline formation, enabling the fabrication of optoelectronic devices via melt processing. Notably, this is the first report of meltable semiconducting CPs comprising benzenethiol&#8208;derived ligands. These findings offer a rational design strategy for developing melt&#8208;processable semiconductive materials based on metal&#8211;benzenethiolate CPs.

&lt;p&gt;We report the first meltable semiconducting Pb(II)-benzenethiolate coordination polymer, &lt;b&gt;KGF-34(C6)&lt;/b&gt;. It exhibits higher charge mobility, a narrower bandgap, and greater band dispersion than classical Pb(II)-alkanethiolate coordination polymers. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;KGF-34(C6)&lt;/b&gt; melts, enabling melt-processed optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt Reaction: Catechol Carboxylation Provides Building Blocks for Renewable Plasticizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction of disodium catecholate enables the synthesis of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylated catechols at low temperature and CO2 pressure. Directly derivatizing the resulting carboxylic acid and phenolic moieties in the obtained mixture provides plasticizer blends with efficiencies competitive to commercial benchmarks.








ABSTRACT
Catechol, an important aromatic platform molecule which can be derived from biomass, was carboxylated by mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction of disodium catecholate with CO2, providing a mixture of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylated catechol derivatives. While classical protocols require harsh reaction conditions, involving a high temperature and/or CO2 pressure, a mild ball milling method was developed. This represents the first mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction featuring a low CO2 pressure and reactivity at room temperature. From the individual catechol&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acid reaction products, a library of novel renewable plasticizers was synthesized through esterification of the carboxylic acid functionalities and O&#8208;acylation of the phenolic hydroxy groups. The resulting esters were evaluated in poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), revealing plasticizing efficiencies competitive to benchmark commercial plasticizers. These efficiencies were maintained when the best performing ester substitution pattern was installed on the ball mill&#8208;derived mixture of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylated catechols, making resource intensive separation (e.g. chromatographic separation) of these ortho&#8208;dihydroxybenzene(di)carboxylic acids redundant.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanoconfinement&#8208;Accelerated Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Styrenic Polymers Boosting Proton Conductivity in Nafion&#8208;doped Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a bilayer self&#8208;assembly strategy inspired by phospholipid bilayers to synthesize functional freestanding 2D covalent polymers, demonstrating enhanced mechanical and proton conduction properties when incorporated into Nafion membranes for improved fuel cell performance.








ABSTRACT
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent polymers offer environmental stability, surface area, and mechanical resilience, but preparation of functional, freestanding 2D polymers remains challenging. Inspired by phospholipid bilayers, we developed a bilayer self&#8208;assembly strategy for 2D covalent polymer synthesis with tailored functionalized surface. Ionic amphiphilic styrene monomers employ intramolecular face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking, inducing a folded monomer conformation that achieves a critical packing parameter near unity. This drives 2D nanosheet formation in basic aqueous solution. Concurrent electrostatic repulsion enabled spontaneous exfoliation. In situ radical polymerization within preorganized framework, accelerated by nanoconfinement effect, converted supramolecular assemblies into covalent bilayer polymers with 95% monomer conversion. Incorporating sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized 2D polymers (0.66&#160;wt%) into Nafion D2020 membrane enhanced mechanical strength and proton conductivity at room temperature. Fuel cell testing (70&#176;C, 100% RH) demonstrated increased open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.00&#160;V vs. 0.96&#160;V), suppressed hydrogen permeation, elevated peak power density (678.9&#160;vs. 454.6 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2), and reduced ohmic resistance (25.2&#160;vs. 55.1&#160;m&#937;).

         <title>Distance&#8208;Dependent Energy Transfer Between Organic Fluorophores and Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the dsDNA part adopts a perpendicular orientation to the SWCNT and present a distance&#8208;dependent energy transfer of single fluorescent dyes to SWCNTs. Carbon nanotube energy transfer (CNET) obeys a d&#8722;5 distance dependence with a characteristic distance of 7.4&#160;nm (&#177; 0.7&#160;nm) for 50 % energy transfer.








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising optical biosensing platforms due to their intrinsic near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and environmental sensitivity. While DNA&#8208;SWCNT hybrids have been widely studied, the structural arrangement of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) on SWCNTs and its impact on exciton&#8211;fluorophore interactions remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we introduce carbon nanotube energy transfer with vertical nucleic acids (CNETvNA), in which fluorophores are positioned at defined distances from SWCNTs using guanine&#8208;defect anchored capture sequences hybridized with complementary oligonucleotides. By systematically varying the duplex length from 12 to 24 base pairs, we probe the distance dependence of dye&#8211;SWCNT interactions at the single&#8208;molecule level. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy reveals efficient quenching of ATTO542 and ATTO643 dyes, with lifetime distributions reflecting heterogeneous duplex conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that dsDNA duplexes adopt a predominantly perpendicular orientation relative to the SWCNT axis, with increasing tilt and conformational variability at longer lengths. Combining experimental and computational results, we establish a distance dependence of d&#8722;5 with 7.4 &#177; 0.7&#160;nm for 50% quenching efficiency, consistent with theoretical predictions for point dipole donors and 1D acceptors. These findings provide structural insights into DNA&#8208;SWCNT conjugates and establish CNETvNA as a rational design principle for SWCNT&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Fluorinated Glycan Frameshifts: Automated Synthesis Expedites the Study of Glycan&#8208;Protein Interactions by 19F&#8208;BioNMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the prominence of 19F&#8208;bioNMR in structural research, fluorinated glycans hold enormous potential in glycomimetic frameshift design. However, challenges associated with the stereocontrolled synthesis of these disruptive actors continue to frustrate advances. To address this, the automated synthesis of selectively C&#8208;2 fluorinated glycans related to the O3b antigen of Klebsiella pneumoniae is disclosed, and their interactions with the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) are interrogated spectroscopically.








ABSTRACT
Given the prominence of 19F&#8208;bioNMR in structural research, fluorinated glycan frameshifts hold enormous potential in studying carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. To contribute to this field, the synthesis of selectively C&#8208;2 fluorinated glycans related to the O3b antigen of Klebsiella pneumoniae is disclosed, and their interactions with the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) are interrogated spectroscopically. Automated glycan assembly (AGA) was employed to expedite construction in which the C(sp3)&#8208;F bond was leveraged to control stereoselectivity of &#945;&#8208;mannosylation. Subsequent 19F&#8208;BioNMR analysis of binding to ConA allowed determination of the respective IC50 and KD values; this revealed a conspicuous frameshift&#8208;dependency in which one pattern dominated. Collectively, this study advocates for the strategic utilisation of the C(sp3)&#8208;F bond in the design, construction, and analysis of probes to interrogate ubiquitous mannose&#8208;binding lectins with therapeutic relevance.

However, challenges associated with the stereocontrolled synthesis of these disruptive actors continue to frustrate advances. To address this, the automated synthesis of selectively C-2 fluorinated glycans related to the O3b antigen of &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is disclosed, and their interactions with the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) are interrogated spectroscopically.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the prominence of &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-bioNMR in structural research, fluorinated glycan frameshifts hold enormous potential in studying carbohydrate-protein interactions. To contribute to this field, the synthesis of selectively C-2 fluorinated glycans related to the O3b antigen of &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is disclosed, and their interactions with the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) are interrogated spectroscopically. Automated glycan assembly (AGA) was employed to expedite construction in which the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-F bond was leveraged to control stereoselectivity of &#945;-mannosylation. Subsequent &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-BioNMR analysis of binding to ConA allowed determination of the respective IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; values; this revealed a conspicuous frameshift-dependency in which one pattern dominated. Collectively, this study advocates for the strategic utilisation of the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-F bond in the design, construction, and analysis of probes to interrogate ubiquitous mannose-binding lectins with therapeutic relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>First Principles Identification of Active Sites in Heterogeneous Catalysis: A Case Study on ZnxCryOz for Syngas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin&#8208;outer&#8208;phase (UTOP) catalysts are systems in which an ultrathin outer phase forms on an inner support. Using ZnO/ZnCr2O4 as a prototype, we demonstrate that such configurations are thermodynamically favored and exhibit higher catalytic activity than either constituent alone. Our results further suggest that UTOP architectures may be widespread in heterogeneous catalysis, establishing UTOP catalysts as a general class of catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Discovering next&#8208;generation heterogeneous catalysts calls for embracing the full complexity of active site formation under realistic conditions. Here, we develop a robust machine learning potential (MLP)&#8208;aided computational framework that integrates realistic preparation and reaction conditions to effectively track the formation of active sites and decipher structure&#8208;activity relationships. Using syngas conversion over the ZnxCryOz system as a demonstration, we identified that the system preferentially segregates into ZnO and ZnCr2O4 phases, with ZnO forming a monolayer on ZnCr2O4 surfaces under preparation conditions. Under reaction conditions, by deploying CH&#9472;O bond dissociation as a descriptor, we found that the ZnO/ZnCr2O4(100) surface is the active surface. Crucially, we pinpoint geometrically linked oxygen vacancy pairs as the true active sites. Full microkinetic analyses conducted on these active sites yield kinetic results that align well with experimental observations. Beyond elucidating the active structure, a model for designing oxide/oxide catalysts to achieve high activity is generalized, opening new pathways for accelerating catalyst discovery across a wide range of reactions.

         <title>Expeditious Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkyl Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthetic platform has been developed for the divergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkyl glycosides. This strategy efficiently furnishes diverse O&#8208;, C&#8208;, and N&#8208;glycosides under gold(I) catalysis and facilitates the assembly of bioactive 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;trifluoromethyl antidiabetic drug derivatives by merging photoredox with transition&#8208;metal catalysis. The method provides expedient access to 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkyl carbohydrate analogues with enhanced pharmacological profiles, demonstrating significant potential for drug discovery.








ABSTRACT
In carbohydrate&#8208;based drug discovery, fluorine&#8208;containing substituents are widely used to enhance pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. However, the precise incorporation of C(sp3)&#8208;perfluoroalkyl moieties at the C2 position of sugar scaffolds remains a significant synthetic challenge. In this study, we report a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective protocol for the synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;perfluoroalkyl glycosides from readily available glycals. This protocol demonstrates exceptional substrate generality, encompassing glucal, galactal, rhamnal, sialic acid, and arabinofuranose derivatives. More importantly, this platform enables the efficient synthesis of diverse C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and O&#8208;glycosides (over 50 examples) under gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions, including the synthesis of previously inaccessible 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted nucleoside analogues. Additionally, photocatalytically generated 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;CF3 glycosyl anomeric radicals readily undergo Giese&#8208;type additions to alkenes, affording alkylated glycosides, or engage in cross&#8208;coupling with aryl bromides to deliver antidiabetic drug candidates. Preliminary biological evaluations indicate that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;CF3&#8208;modified glycosides exhibit enhanced pharmacological properties, underscoring the translational potential of this synthetic technique for advancing carbohydrate&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Confined Cu111 Nanolaminates as a Single&#8208;Phase Nanoreactor for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined Cu111 nanolaminates within Cu1.94S/In2S3 heterointerface act as the single&#8208;phase co&#8208;activating nanoreactor for cascade C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediate adsorption, enabling an ultra&#8208;narrow C&#9472;N coupling window for efficient urea synthesis.








ABSTRACT
Modern electrocatalysis typically involves multi&#8208;species cascade systems, imposing stringent requirements on catalysts to exhibit multi&#8208;component and multifunctional characteristics. Such complexity poses great challenges for identifying and understanding the structural and functional nature of the true active phase. Herein, we report the formation of Cu111 nanolaminates confined within the interface of Cu1.94S/In2S3 heterojunction via in situ electrochemical reconstruction. The synthesized Cu111 nanolaminates act as a single&#8208;phase co&#8208;activating nanoreactor to preferentially adsorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and cascade N&#8208;intermediates, enabling C&#9472;N coupling for urea synthesis within an ultra&#8208;low and distinct potential window. The optimized Cu1.94S/Cu111/In2S3 catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 11823.65&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgCu111&#8722;1 and an exceptionally high Faradaic efficiency of 69.34% at &#8208;0.35&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell, surpassing all previously reported transition metal electrocatalysts. In situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations reveal a favorable reaction pathway and nanoconfined synergy on the Cu111 nanolaminates, where CO2 is initially anchored and reduced to *CO and cascaded *NO2 undergoes C&#9472;N coupling to form the key *CONO2 intermediate toward urea. This study unveils the true active phase within a complex heterostructure electrocatalyst, which also provides new insights into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for other energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network&#8208;Directed Controllable Assembly of Stable Cyanine J&#8208;Aggregates for Long&#8208;Term and High&#8208;Contrast In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a strategy for constructing ultra&#8208;stable, optically controllable cyanine J&#8208;aggregates (JCy) that rapidly self&#8208;assemble in vivo. Through the integration of carboxyl groups and precise adjustment of alkyl chain lengths, JCy dyes are enabled to undergo carrier&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly while enhancing their stability. This, in turn, facilitates long&#8208;term, high&#8208;contrast imaging of gastric and tumor tissues in mice.








ABSTRACT
Optical probes based on near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) small&#8208;molecule dyes have emerged as an indispensable tool for contemporary in vivo biomedical research. Nevertheless, the majority of the reported NIR small&#8208;molecule probes are plagued by issues such as poor stability, short excitation wavelength, and inadequate lesion retention ability, all of which significantly hinder accuracy in vivo imaging. Herein, we introduce a strategy to construct ultra&#8208;stable and optically controllable J&#8208;aggregated cyanine (JCy) with rapid in vivo self&#8208;assembly ability by incorporating carboxyl groups and adjusting the alkyl chain length of classical heptamethine cyanine dye. Single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the strong hydrogen bonds formed by carboxyl groups enable JCy dyes to assemble into Z&#8208;shaped dimers and the dimers interlocking &#8220;linear supramolecular arrays (LSA)&#8221; within the crystal. These LSAs then undergo a tight and ordered J&#8208;aggregation through the electrostatic interactions, C&#9472;H&#8943;O hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This unique J&#8208;aggregation mechanism confers JCy dyes with carrier&#8208;independent in vivo self&#8208;assembly and superior stability. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we selected JCy&#8208;Bu, which exhibits low concentration dependence, remarkable resistance to protein interference, and outstanding photochemical stability, for in vivo biological study, and have achieved long&#8208;term, high&#8208;contrast in situ imaging of mouse gastric and tumor tissues.

These LSAs then undergo a tight and ordered J-aggregation through the electrostatic interactions, C&#9472;H&#8943;O hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This unique J-aggregation mechanism confers &lt;b&gt;JCy&lt;/b&gt; dyes with carrier-independent in vivo self-assembly and superior stability. As a proof-of-concept, we selected &lt;b&gt;JCy-Bu&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibits low concentration dependence, remarkable resistance to protein interference, and outstanding photochemical stability, for in vivo biological study, and have achieved long-term, high-contrast in situ imaging of mouse gastric and tumor tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnesiation of Phenol Derivatives Catalyzed by a Rhodium&#9472;Aluminum Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the generation of aryl Grignard reagents from phenol derivatives via C&#9472;O bond activation cooperatively catalyzed by Rh&#9472;Al heterobimetallic complexes. This methodology enables the efficient conversion of a broad range of phenol derivatives into the corresponding Grignard reagents, which can subsequently react with various electrophiles to yield a diverse array of organic compounds.








ABSTRACT
Here we describe the generation of aryl Grignard reagents from phenol derivatives via C&#9472;O bond activation cooperatively catalyzed by Rh&#9472;Al heterobimetallic complexes. We discovered that the electron&#8208;rich arylmagnesium reagents could be efficiently prepared from the corresponding aryl carbamates, whereas the &#960;&#8208;extended arylmagnesium reagents were obtained from the corresponding aryl ethers. This methodology enables the efficient conversion of a broad range of phenol derivatives into the corresponding Grignard reagents, which can subsequently react with various electrophiles to yield a diverse array of organic compounds.

         <title>Terminal Cyanate in Stabilizing Mononuclear Cu(III) Complex: Room Temperature Preparation, Characterization, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique high valent metal oxidant, copper(III)&#8208;cyanate is developed under ambient conditions and characterized. The copper&#8208;cyanate oxidant oxidizes hydrocarbons and phenols through hydrogen atom transfer mechanism with reaction rates comparable to some reported reactive metal oxidants. The oxidant performs C&#9472;N bond formation by activating C&#9472;H bond and cyanate group transfer reactions.








ABSTRACT
Great efforts have been made to generate new types of late transition metal oxidants by tuning terminal ligands. These metal oxidants play a key role to activate and functionalize C&#9472;H bond via proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. Herein, we have developed a unique oxidant, high valent metal&#8208;cyanate, under ambient conditions. The high valent complex [(L)CuIII(NCO)] (2, H2L &#9552; N,N&#8242;&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide) was prepared from [(L)CuII(NCO)]Bu4N (1) by one electron oxidation and both complexes were characterized by x&#8208;ray crystallography and UV&#8211;vis, 1H/13C NMR, Raman, FT&#8208;IR and EPR spectroscopies, and ESI&#8211;MS. 2 reacted with C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bond via hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, as evidenced by kinetic data, product analysis and computational findings, and reaction rates are comparable to some reported reactive metal oxidants. Fascinatingly, 2 performed direct C&#9472;N bond formation by activating C&#9472;H bond and cyanate group transfer reactions. We observed solvent dependent reactions of 2. Our results found a new class of metal oxidant for strong C&#9472;H bond functionalization. We believe that high valent metal&#8208;cyanates could open new avenues for very interesting coordination and bioinspired oxidation chemistry due to electronic, resonating, and ambidentate properties of terminal cyanate ligand with potential two different proton accepting sites (N and O).

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Polymerization of Thioctic Acid Triggered by Polyoxometalate Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal polymerization of thioctic acid (TA) is realized, in which reduced polyoxometalates serve as photothermal agents and linkers, therefore improving the conversion rate of monomer and molecular weights of resulting polymers. By tuning the monomer composition, TA&#8208;based adhesives and elastomers are fabricated, exhibiting excellent re&#8208;processability through NIR&#8208;triggered remelting or repair.








ABSTRACT
The monomer conversion rate of thioctic acid (TA) and the cross&#8208;linking degree of polymer chains significantly influence the performance of materials, making them important research topics. Herein, by selecting a reduced polyoxometalate complex modified with 1&#8208;allylpyridinium cations, which exhibits strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption capability, as both photothermal agent and cross&#8208;linking agent, the polymerization of TA is successfully achieved under NIR light irradiation. The incorporation of photothermal agents results in their multiple dispersion throughout the polymerization matrix, facilitating uniform internal heat generation and inside&#8208;out thermal diffusion. This mechanism significantly shortens the heat conduction pathway and effectively mitigates the inhomogeneous polymerization typically caused by temperature gradients inherent in conventional heating methods. Moreover, the C&#9472;S bonds formed via the reaction between the C&#9552;C groups and the disulfide linkages of TA not only suppress depolymerization but also serve as robust anchoring sites within the polymer network. By tuning the monomer composition, TA&#8208;based adhesives and elastomers are successfully fabricated, exhibiting excellent re&#8208;processability through NIR&#8208;triggered remelting or repair. The NIR&#8208;light&#8208;regulated polymerization approach offers distinct advantages, including operational simplicity, rapid response, and spatiotemporal control, thereby presenting a promising strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance TA&#8208;based polymers.

         <title>Photoswitch Mediated Electron Highway Driving Direct Pollutant&#8208;to&#8208;Oxidant Electron Transfer in Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals an overlooked photoswitch&#8208;mediated electron transfer mechanism that circumvents reactive oxygen species by enabling direct, ultrafast electron transfer from pollutants to oxidants through a photoactive mediator. The mechanism allows precise optical control over reaction initiation and termination, providing unparalleled spatiotemporal regulation for sustainable wastewater treatment.








ABSTRACT
Traditional heterogeneous photocatalytic systems coupled with oxidant activation hold great promise for environmental remediation but are constrained by radical scavenging and nonselective oxidation. Here, we introduce an overlooked photoswitch&#8208;mediated electron transfer (PSMET) mechanism that circumvents reactive oxygen species by enabling direct, ultrafast electron transfer from pollutants to oxidants through a photoactive mediator. Using environmentally benign bismuth oxyiodide as a model catalyst under visible&#8208;light irradiation, we achieve unprecedented degradation rates for various electron&#8208;rich pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole (t1/2 &lt;2.0&#160;min). This mechanism exhibits pollutant&#8208;dependent oxidant utilization mode and selective pollutant degradation characteristics. Mechanistic analyses reveal the formation of a high&#8208;potential electron&#8208;transfer pathway activated by photoexcitation, directly coupling pollutant oxidation to oxidant reduction within a single electron&#8208;transfer cycle. Frontier molecular orbital calculations further demonstrate that the narrow bandgap and p&#8208;type semiconductor characteristics selectively facilitate electron extraction from contaminants to oxidants. Remarkably, this PSMET mechanism displays universal applicability with diverse oxidants, maintaining &gt;98% pollutant removals even in complex aqueous matrices and continuous&#8208;flow systems. Furthermore, the mechanism allows precise optical control over reaction initiation and termination, offering unparalleled spatiotemporal regulation for sustainable wastewater treatment. Our findings redefine photocatalytic oxidation paradigms and open new pathways toward energy&#8208;efficient, optically programmable, and environmentally sustainable remediation technologies.

         <title>Correlating Structure Change With Magnetic Ordering and Spin Fluctuation During Delithiation of Transition Metal Layered Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates a one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between structural phase transitions and magnetic evolution in LiCoO2 during delithiation. By combining operando synchrotron XRD with magnetic analysis, we reveal redox&#8208;driven spin&#8208;state fluctuations and establish a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram, offering a &#8220;spin&#8208;electronics&#8221; perspective for designing next&#8208;generation battery cathodes.








ABSTRACT
Current Li&#8208;ion battery technology relies on Li+ insertion/extraction coupled with electron gaining/loss at both cathodes and anodes. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to studying the structure change of cathode materials with Li+ extraction/insertion, changes in the magnetic properties arising from the accompanying redox processes have been largely overlooked. Here, we systematically investigate both the structure evolution and magnetic&#8208;property changes during the delithiation of the representative layered oxide LiCoO2, by combining the operando synchrotron&#8208;based x&#8208;ray diffraction with dedicated magnetic measurements. We construct a magnetic phase diagram as a function of Li content x in LixCoO2, which closely mirrors the corresponding structure evolution diagram. The results reveal a series of complicated magnetic transitions upon Li extraction: paramagnetic &#8594; antiferromagnetic &#8594; paramagnetic &#8594; diamagnetic &#8594; paramagnetic.

     alt="Correlating Structure Change With Magnetic Ordering and Spin Fluctuation During Delithiation of Transition Metal Layered Oxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study elucidates a one-to-one correspondence between structural phase transitions and magnetic evolution in LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during delithiation. By combining operando synchrotron XRD with magnetic analysis, we reveal redox-driven spin-state fluctuations and establish a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram, offering a &#8220;spin-electronics&#8221; perspective for designing next-generation battery cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Li-ion battery technology relies on Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion/extraction coupled with electron gaining/loss at both cathodes and anodes. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to studying the structure change of cathode materials with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; extraction/insertion, changes in the magnetic properties arising from the accompanying redox processes have been largely overlooked. Here, we systematically investigate both the structure evolution and magnetic-property changes during the delithiation of the representative layered oxide LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, by combining the operando synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction with dedicated magnetic measurements. We construct a magnetic phase diagram as a function of Li content &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; in Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which closely mirrors the corresponding structure evolution diagram. The results reveal a series of complicated magnetic transitions upon Li extraction: paramagnetic &#8594; antiferromagnetic &#8594; paramagnetic &#8594; diamagnetic &#8594; paramagnetic. Moreover, the variation in the effective magnetic moment of Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly correlated with local structural changes within the CoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra, indicating that the Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; spin-state fluctuation may play an important role in the structure evolution and electrochemical performance. These findings help close a critical gap in understanding structure-magnetism coupling during the electrochemical cycling and may inspire the design of new layered oxide cathodes from a spin-electronics perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Design of a Flexible Highly Conductive Additive&#8208;Free Polymer Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first flexible, binder&#8208; and carbon&#8208;free organic cathode (poly&#8208;benzodifurandione, PBFO) for Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries, discovered via ML screening of the ZINC database. The flexible PBFO film exhibits a breakthrough conductivity of 5.9&#215;102 S cm&#8722;1&#8212;the highest among additive&#8208;free organic cathodes&#8212;and delivers a reversible capacity of 262 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 2.5&#160;V versus Li+/Li and good stability.








ABSTRACT
Organic cathode materials (OCMs) are promising sustainable alternatives to inorganic counterparts for next&#8208;generation batteries, yet their widespread application is largely hindered by intrinsically low electrical conductivity (below 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1) and material dissolution. The vast chemical space for exploration complicates the discovery of optimal OCMs. In this work, we utilized a machine learning (ML)&#8208;based discovery process with a pretrained transformer model in ZINC organic molecules database, yielding a couple of potential high&#8208;performance OCMs candidates, including isoindigo&#8208;type redox units. The output of such efficient screening inspires the design of poly&#8208;benzodifurandione (PBFO) as a free&#8208;standing cathode material for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion storage. The flexible PBFO film exhibits a breakthrough conductivity of 5.9&#215;102 S cm&#8722;1, setting a new benchmark for additive&#8208;free organic cathodes. The neat PBFO cathodes achieve a reversible capacity of 262 mAh g&#8722;1 averaging at 2.5&#160;V versus Li+/Li at 25&#160;mA g&#8722;1, delivering a high electrode&#8208;level energy density of 655&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, among the highest reported for OCMs. This work provides the first flexible, high&#8208;conductivity organic cathodes without conductive additives and binders, opening a new direction toward viable organic batteries.

         <title>Protective Shield for Interfacial Cu+/Cu0 Sites Enhances Multicarbon Production Toward Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a &#8220;protective shield&#8221; on the Cu+/Cu0 interface by acid radicals, thereby achieving robust active sites for C2+ production towards CO2RR. In CO2RR, protons are preferentially captured by the acid radicals, preventing their contact with the oxygen atoms on the Cu+/Cu0 interface. Subsequently, the captured protons can react with adsorbed intermediates via PCET, enabling the continuous hydrogenation reaction in CO2RR.








ABSTRACT
The interface of Cu+/Cu0 is a promising active site for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products towards the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), whereas the cathodic environment commonly destroys this site by Cu+ reduction. Herein, we introduced the acid radical of trimesic acid (BTC) by electrochemical reconstruction as a &#8220;protective shield&#8221; for the stabilization of the Cu+/Cu0 interface. The BTC&#8208;stabilized Cu+/Cu0 interface displayed a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86.4&#160;&#177;&#160;2.4% for C2+ products at 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 towards CO2RR in neutral electrolyte, with the retention of Cu+/Cu0 interface during the reaction. Such stabilization effect by BTC shield was attributed to the preferential trapping of the *H intermediates and decreased *H&#8208;induced transfer and corrosion for Cu+. The BTC&#8208;stabilized Cu+/Cu0 interface displayed a distinct asymmetry coupling path between *CO and *COH, which lowered the energy barrier of C2+ production. This work represents a new strategy for the stabilization of interfacial Cu+/Cu0 sites towards CO2RR.

         <title>Methyl Asymmetric Interference&#8208;Enhanced Dipole&#8211;Dipole Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8211;Graphite Battery Electrolyte Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We formulate an asymmetric interference&#8208;enhanced localized high&#8208;concentration potassium&#8208;ion electrolyte, which not only enables the graphite anode to achieve an initial Coulombic efficiency as high as 86.5% but also provides an electrochemical stability window upper limit of 4.6&#160;V for high&#8208;voltage cathodes.








ABSTRACT
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries are the only new alkali metal battery system, apart from lithium&#8208;ion batteries, that can directly use graphite as the anode. However, the development of potassium&#8211;graphite batteries has been restricted due to the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes compatible with graphite anodes. To address this issue, a graphite&#8208;compatible high&#8208;voltage electrolyte is designed based on methyl asymmetric interference&#8208;enhanced dipole&#8211;dipole interactions. The formulated electrolyte achieves an initial Coulombic efficiency of 86.5% by reducing the desolvation energy of K+ ions and forming a sulfur&#8208;rich inorganic solid electrolyte interface. At a low current density of 1&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, the maximum stable electrochemical window of the electrolyte reaches 4.6&#160;V, which is compatible with the currently used Prussian blue analogue cathodes. Notably, the potassium&#8211;graphite battery with K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94&#183;0.5H2O as the cathode and untreated graphite as the anode can deliver an energy density of 265.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total mass of cathode and anode) with a capacity retention of 81.3% after 600 cycles. When K1.68Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#183;1.36H2O is used as the cathode, the energy density can reach 306.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. A five&#8208;stacked pouch full cell with a capacity of &#8764;24&#160;mAh can rapidly drive a small motor, demonstrating the application potential of the electrolyte.

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Efficient Gold Recovery Enabled by a Polydopamine&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional polydopamine was strategically integrated into the robust porous TATP framework to create a photoactive TATP/polydopamine adsorbent for efficient gold recovery from e&#8208;waste. The integration of multiple adsorption sites and light&#8208;assisted enhancement synergistically improved the gold recovery performance, while enabling its use as a green photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.








ABSTRACT
The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and information technologies is driving a sharp increase in global electronic waste, creating an urgent demand for recovering precious metals like gold from secondary resources to achieve environmental and economic benefits. Herein, a polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework composite, denoted as TATP/PDA, is designed in combination with a light&#8208;assisted strategy for efficient gold recovery. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between PDA and the TATP COF, which enhance photoelectric activity and provide abundant adsorption sites, the TATP/PDA exhibits an exceptional adsorption capacity of 5220 mg&#183;g&#8722;1, ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&gt;99% removal efficiency within 30 s), and remarkable selectivity in complex matrices. Experimental characterizations disclose that the engineered abundant nitrogen and oxygen active sites, along with the inherent photocatalytic reduction capability, significantly enhance the gold adsorption performance. These key merits position TATP/PDA as one of the best&#8208;performing materials in terms of overall performance. In practical application, TATP/PDA exhibits exceptional performance in recovering gold from real e&#8208;waste leachate. Moreover, the recovered gold&#8208;loaded composite serves as a sustainable photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. This dual&#8208;benefit strategy not only promotes resource recycling but also contributes to the goals of a green and circular economy.

     alt="Light-Promoted Efficient Gold Recovery Enabled by a Polydopamine-Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio-inspired multifunctional polydopamine was strategically integrated into the robust porous TATP framework to create a photoactive TATP/polydopamine adsorbent for efficient gold recovery from e-waste. The integration of multiple adsorption sites and light-assisted enhancement synergistically improved the gold recovery performance, while enabling its use as a green photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and information technologies is driving a sharp increase in global electronic waste, creating an urgent demand for recovering precious metals like gold from secondary resources to achieve environmental and economic benefits. Herein, a polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized &#946;-ketoenamine-linked covalent organic framework composite, denoted as TATP/PDA, is designed in combination with a light-assisted strategy for efficient gold recovery. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; interactions between PDA and the TATP COF, which enhance photoelectric activity and provide abundant adsorption sites, the TATP/PDA exhibits an exceptional adsorption capacity of 5220 mg&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&amp;gt;99% removal efficiency within 30 s), and remarkable selectivity in complex matrices. Experimental characterizations disclose that the engineered abundant nitrogen and oxygen active sites, along with the inherent photocatalytic reduction capability, significantly enhance the gold adsorption performance. These key merits position TATP/PDA as one of the best-performing materials in terms of overall performance. In practical application, TATP/PDA exhibits exceptional performance in recovering gold from real e-waste leachate. Moreover, the recovered gold-loaded composite serves as a sustainable photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. This dual-benefit strategy not only promotes resource recycling but also contributes to the goals of a green and circular economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Regulating the electron structure of COF to achieve the uniform deposition of Li+.








ABSTRACT
The inherent factors influencing the growth of lithium (Li) dendrites and the kinetics of Li+ migration in polymer electrolytes lie in the electron cloud density distribution in the electrolyte. Localized electrons accumulation can trigger the uneven Li+ deposition, ultimately leading to battery failure. To address this critical challenge, the concept of p&#8211;&#960; conjugation and B&#8211;O sp2 hybridization is innovatively incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to mitigate local interfacial Li+ accumulation and improve Li+ migration kinetics in electrolytes by electron delocalization. Furthermore, perfluoroalkyl group with virtues of superior electron regulating capabilities and improved electrochemical&#8208;window, is strategically grafted to better match high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Under the synergistic role of electron regulation, the electrolyte with p&#960;&#8211;sp2&#8208;COF significantly improves overall electrochemical performance of solid&#8208;state batteries. Thus, regulating electron density via p&#8208;&#960; conjugation and B&#8208;O sp2 hybridization promises to open new avenues for the development of COFs&#8208;modified polymer electrolytes in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Homopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces highly reactive soft long&#8208;chain crosslinkers into PVDF homopolymers, achieving intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics with &gt;80% elastic recovery at 60% strain, a high remanent polarization of 7.00 &#181;C/cm2 at 110&#176;C, and stable ferroelectric response under 70% strain, providing a low&#8208;cost, thermally robust pathway for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.








ABSTRACT
Elastic ferroelectrics, distinguished by their softness, stretchability, and ferroelectric and piezoelectric responses, are promising candidates in next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. Currently, the intrinsic elastification of ferroelectric polymers has been achieved through a &#8220;slight crosslinking&#8221; strategy, which relies on costly poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based copolymers with low Curie temperatures, thereby limiting their operation at high temperatures. In contrast, PVDF homopolymers are low&#8208;cost and possess an inherently high Curie temperature, while their high modulus has long hindered elasticity. Here, we overcome these limitations by introducing highly reactive, soft long&#8208;chain crosslinkers into PVDF homopolymers, enabling simultaneous low cost, high thermal stability, and intrinsic elasticity. By tuning the crosslinking density, intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics based on PVDF homopolymer were obtained with over 80% elastic recovery under 60% strain. Remarkably, the materials retain a high remanent polarization (Pr) of 7.00&#160;&#181;C/cm2 at 110&#176;C. The materials maintain stable ferroelectric responses even under strains up to 70%. This study resolves the long&#8208;standing challenge of elastifying high&#8208;modulus PVDF homopolymers and develops a low&#8208;cost, thermally robust, intrinsically elastic ferroelectric. These advances outline a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation wearable electronics that demand both high elasticity and high&#8208;temperature operation.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Regulated Conversion of Small Resource Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on the electrocatalytic conversion of resource molecules, such as CO2 and NO3&#8722;, and proposes a spatially resolved classification of electrolyte effects into short&#8208;, medium&#8208;, and long&#8208;range interactions. This framework highlights the active role of electrolytes in shaping interfacial environments and offers a new perspective for understanding and designing advanced electrocatalytic systems.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalysis powered by renewable electricity is a promising strategy for clean energy transformation and achieving carbon neutrality goals. In resource molecules conversion (e.g., CO2 and NO3&#8722;), electrolytes serve multiple roles as reaction media, proton donors, and mass&#8208;transport carriers, with their composition and physicochemical properties exerting a significant influence on reaction pathways, intermediate stability, and product selectivity. Most research endeavors have predominantly concentrated on catalyst design, often oversimplifying electrolytes as inert backgrounds. This minireview proposes a classification framework for electrolyte effects into short&#8208;, medium&#8208;, and long&#8208;range interactions, highlighting their active regulatory roles at electrified interfaces. A comprehensive overview is provided of recent advancements in methodologies for investigating solvent effects, accompanied by an in&#8208;depth analysis of representative electrocatalytic systems. This analysis elucidates how the composition of electrolytes influences molecular&#8208;level elementary reaction steps, the dynamic reorganization and equilibrium of the interfacial microenvironment, as well as macroscopic catalytic performance, through a variety of distinct mechanisms. Finally, the key challenges and opportunities are also discussed, emphasizing electrolyte engineering as a strategic tool to reshape reaction environments and accelerate the practical deployment of electrocatalytic technologies.

         <title>Proximity Engineering of Fe&#8210;N4 Twins for Oriented Generation of Singlet Oxygen for Hospital Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise modulation of Fe&#8211;N4 site distances constructs spin&#8208;regulated Fe&#8211;N4 twins, triggering a volcano&#8208;type Fenton&#8208;like activity and promoting oriented singlet oxygen generation. The twin&#8208;site catalyst enables highly selective and efficient hospital wastewater purification with simultaneous pharmaceutical degradation and disinfection under low peroxymonosulfate dosage.








ABSTRACT
Precisely tailoring the molecular configurations of single&#8208;atom sites and elucidating their correlation with generated specific reactive species is crucial for advancing Fenton&#8208;like chemistry toward targeted remediation. Herein, we developed a facile approach to precisely modulate the distances between isolated Fe&#8210;N4 sites (dFe&#8211;Fe) from nanometer (0.95&#160;nm) to subnanometer (0.43&#160;nm) to construct a family of well&#8208;defined Fe&#8210;N4 twins with manipulated ligand&#8208;field strength and spin states. Different Fe&#8210;N4 twin sites trigger a metal&#8208;loading&#8208;independent volcano&#8208;shaped Fenton&#8208;like activity trend. The optimal configuration, achieved at an Fe&#8210;Fe distance of 0.43&#160;nm (Fed0.43SA), induces an intermediate&#8208;spin (t2g4eg1) configuration that optimizes eg orbital occupancy, thereby promoting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption to form *HSO5&#8722; and subsequently lowers the energy barrier for coupling with another PMS to selectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2). The robust molecular catalyst with Fe&#8210;N4 twin sites sustains over 120&#160;h of continuous treatment of organic wastewater and demonstrates simultaneous disinfection and pharmaceutical removal of actual hospital wastewater. This work presents an advanced strategy for engineering single&#8208;atom sites with multi&#8208;site cooperativity to regulate Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, enabling rapid and real&#8208;world water purification.

         <title>Synergistic Ion&#8208;Pair/Lewis Acid Catalysis Enables Enantioselective Synthesis of Helically Chiral Oxa[6]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic phosphonium&#8208;silver catalytic system enables an unprecedented asymmetric ring&#8208;expansion, converting oxa[5]&#8208; to oxa[6]helicenes via a helicity&#8208;selective [4 + 2] cyclization/aromatization cascade. Dual&#8208;catalyst cooperation delivers diverse oxa[6]helicenes in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities with broad scope and scalability. Mechanistic studies reveal a sandwich&#8208;type transition state that clarifies the asymmetric induction, establishing a general modular approach to complex helicenes via synergistic catalysis.








ABSTRACT
Helicenes are privileged chiral architectures with exceptional optical and electronic properties, underpinning their importance in asymmetric catalysis, optoelectronics, and supramolecular chemistry. Despite significant progress in helicene synthesis, strategies for extending peripheral aromatic rings to access structurally diversified helicenes remain elusive. Here we report a synergistic catalytic system integrating a bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS) with silver, which enables a highly efficient [4 + 2] cyclization/aromatization cascade to directly construct a new family of oxa[6]helicenes. This cooperative catalysis exhibits broad substrate scope, delivering chiral helicenes in excellent yield and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that Ag+ activates the cyano group, while the BPS catalyst engages through hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;pairing interactions to form a unique sandwich&#8208;type transition state. This dual activation mode provides a powerful framework for constructing helicenes with tailored structural diversity, paving the way for future applications in chiroptical materials and enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>Millisecond Aliphatic Iodonium&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement Enabling Dual Functionalization of Alkenyl Iodanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The replacement of classic central oxygen with iodine(III) in aliphatic Claisen rearrangement significantly lowers the rearrangement barrier, broadens the scope of rearrangement precursors and enables dual functionalization of alkenyl iodanes.








ABSTRACT
The evolution of Claisen rearrangements through expansion of the central atom from classical oxygen to sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus has reshaped the reaction manifold by redefining substrates, enabling new modes of selectivity control, and enriching product diversity. Here we report an aliphatic iodonium Claisen rearrangement of alkenyl iodanes with suitable nucleophiles. Substitution of the classic oxygen center by an iodine(III) moiety enables allyl alkenyl iodonium species to undergo rearrangement at &#8722;78&#160;&#176;C with completion in less than 0.1 s, while broadening the scope of rearrangement partners to include allyl/propargyl silanes, &#945;&#8209;stannyl nitriles, TMSN3, TMSOAc, and phenols, thereby expanding the structural diversity of accessible products. Beyond furnishing conventional rearrangement products, the rearrangement intermediates can be intercepted intra&#8208; or intermolecularly by diverse carbon&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles, enabling dual functionalization of alkenyl iodanes. Mechanistic studies rationalize the unusually rapid kinetics of the rearrangement and reveal a pronounced trans influence exerted by the hypervalent iodine center, which not only governs the assembly of reactive partners but also facilitates the rearrangement.

         <title>Trimeric Acceptors with Fine&#8208;Tuned Alkyl&#8208;Linkage Sites for 20.23% Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four trimeric giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) with different alkyl&#8208;linking sites were developed. Among them, wing&#8208;site linked 3Y&#8208;Wing has better molecular conformation and optoelectronic properties, achieving an efficiency of 20.23%. Notably, 20.23% efficiency is the highest value among the reported trimeric GMAs and non&#8208;fully conjugated GMAs.








ABSTRACT
Giant&#8208;molecule acceptors (GMAs) have been proven to improve power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs), while most high&#8208;performance GMAs only attach two monomers and primarily exhibit the properties of their monomer precursors. Herein, we develop four trimeric GMAs (named 3Y&#8208;site, including wing&#8208;sites&#8208;linked 3Y&#8208;Wing, end&#8208;sites&#8208;linked 3Y&#8208;End, hybrid wing/end&#8208;sites&#8208;linked 3Y&#8208;EWE and 3Y&#8208;WEW) with the same alkylated linker but different linking sites to fine&#8208;tune molecular optoelectronic properties. Among them, 3Y&#8208;Wing with a superior planarity and extensibility possesses broadened absorption, better crystallinity, superior packing, and higher glass transition temperature, resulting in an optimized phase separation. The optimized devices with binary PM6:3Y&#8208;Wing and ternary PM6:L8&#8208;BO:3Y&#8208;Wing achieve both champion PCEs of 15.0% and 19.1%, respectively, along with enhanced light, thermal, and storage stabilities, outperforming devices based on all other 3Y&#8208;site counterparts. In the classic D18:L8&#8208;BO host system, the effectiveness of 3Y&#8208;Wing in boosting PCE is further validated, and the resulted ternary devices deliver an excellent PCE of 20.23%, setting an efficiency record among the reported trimeric GMAs. Moreover, the 3Y&#8208;Wing based OSCs offer a better balance of high PCE and stability, further distinguishing them within 3Y&#8208;site series. Our developed wing&#8208;sites&#8208;linked trimeric 3Y&#8208;Wing is a promising candidate to achieve both high device efficiency and stability.

         <title>Bioinspired Mo&#8208;on&#8208;Cu Nanosheets Enable Potential&#8208;Dependent Electrosynthesis of Urea and Methanol via Interfacial Electron Redistribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo&#8208;on&#8208;Cu NSs induce interfacial electron redistribution and optimize intermediate conversion pathways, thereby enhancing conductivity and enabling potential&#8208;dependent selectivity toward urea (52% FE at &#8722;0.2&#160;V vs. RHE) and methanol (65% FE at &#8722;0.5&#160;V vs. RHE) in the same reaction system.








ABSTRACT
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 and its co&#8208;reduction with NO3&#8722; ions provide green pathways for the sustainable synthesis of methanol and urea; however, achieving the selective production of both compounds at low potentials remains a challenge. Inspired by natural Mo&#8208;containing enzymes, we develop Mo&#8208;on&#8208;Cu nanosheets (Mo&#8208;Cu NSs) via electrochemical reduction of CuO NSs followed by Mo deposition through electron&#8208;beam evaporation. The bioinspired Mo&#8208;Cu NSs deliver outstanding activity, achieving a urea partial current density of 2.39&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 52% at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE, and a methanol FE of 65% at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE, ranking among the most efficient electrocatalysts for co&#8208;synthesis of urea and methanol. In situ electrochemical characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that interfacial electron redistribution between electron&#8208;rich Cu and electron&#8208;deficient Mo optimizes intermediate conversion pathways, thereby enabling potential&#8208;dependent product selectivity. Specifically, *CO2 and *NOH coupling accounts for urea formation, while *NO intermediates promote methanol production. This study not only provides a new electrocatalyst for highly efficient urea and methanol electrosynthesis but also can guide the design of other electrocatalysts for high&#8208;value chemicals.

         <title>Scalable Ru&#8208;Doped Pt/NiFe&#8208;LDH Catalyst via Pulse Electrolysis Enables Stable Glycerol Oxidation to Glyceric Acid at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electro&#8208;reforming of glycerol into high&#8208;value glyceric acid and H2 is achieved at an industry&#8208;level current density using a scalable Ru&#8208;doped Pt/NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst. A stable over 120&#160;h operation was demonstrated in a flow electrolyzer under a universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy.








ABSTRACT
Selective electrooxidation of glycerol (GLY) to glyceric acid (GLA) offers a promising route for GLY valorization but remains hindered by limited activity and stability. Herein, we report a scalable self&#8208;corrosion strategy for large&#8208;area fabrication of a Ru&#8208;doped Pt/NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst on Ni foam (PtRu/NiFe&#8208;LDH) with an area of up to 36 cm2. The incorporation of Ru modulates the electronic structure, enhances the adsorption of both OH&#8722; and GLY, and lowers the free energy barrier for OH* formation, thereby significantly boosting catalytic activity to achieve a recorded current density of 439.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, pulse electrolysis effectively suppresses the formation of PtOx, ensuring long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a GLY oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution system, this bifunctional catalyst reduces the cell voltage by 1.01&#160;V relative to conventional water splitting, while delivering 78.5% selectivity towards GLA and stable operation for over 120&#160;h. This work establishes a viable pathway toward the industrialization of selective electrochemical oxidation of GLY to GLA by integrating advanced catalyst design with optimized electrolyzer configuration.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective electrooxidation of glycerol (GLY) to glyceric acid (GLA) offers a promising route for GLY valorization but remains hindered by limited activity and stability. Herein, we report a scalable self-corrosion strategy for large-area fabrication of a Ru-doped Pt/NiFe-LDH catalyst on Ni foam (PtRu/NiFe-LDH) with an area of up to 36 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The incorporation of Ru modulates the electronic structure, enhances the adsorption of both OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and GLY, and lowers the free energy barrier for OH* formation, thereby significantly boosting catalytic activity to achieve a recorded current density of 439.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, pulse electrolysis effectively suppresses the formation of PtO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ensuring long-term stability. When integrated into a GLY oxidation-assisted hydrogen evolution system, this bifunctional catalyst reduces the cell voltage by 1.01&#160;V relative to conventional water splitting, while delivering 78.5% selectivity towards GLA and stable operation for over 120&#160;h. This work establishes a viable pathway toward the industrialization of selective electrochemical oxidation of GLY to GLA by integrating advanced catalyst design with optimized electrolyzer configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Simplest Phosphinylperoxy Radical and Its Isomers in the Photochemical Phosphorus&#8208;Hydrogen&#8208;Oxygen Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photooxidation of the simplest phophinyl radical (&#8226;PH2) by O2 yields the elusive phosphinylperoxy radical H2POO&#8226; and its isomers HP(O)OH&#8226; and &#8226;P(OH)2, which are important intermediates in the photochemical phosphorus&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;oxygen network of PH3 in the atmosphere.








ABSTRACT
The oxidation of phosphine (PH3) plays an important role in the photochemical phosphorus&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;oxygen network of the Earth's atmosphere. The phosphinyl radical (&#8226;PH2) is a key intermediate in the photochemistry of PH3, and its reactions with O2 yield phosphorus oxyacids as stable reservoirs via the intermediacy of yet elusive radicals. Herein, we report the identification of the simplest phosphinylperoxy radical H2POO&#8226; in gas phase reaction between &#8226;PH2 and O2. The characterization of H2POO&#8226; with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208; and 18O&#8208;isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Upon photoexcitation at 410&#160;nm, the matrix&#8208;isolated H2POO&#8226; undergoes successive hydrogen&#8208;migration to form two isomers HP(O)OH&#8226; and &#8226;P(OH)2. Further UV&#8208;irradiation at 365&#160;nm causes decomposition to yield the water complex of phosphorus monoxide (&#8226;PO), which can be photolytically converted to metaphosphorous acid (HOPO). The disclosed photochemistry of these novel phosphorus&#8208;bearing molecules helps in understanding the photochemical network of PH3 in the atmospheric and interstellar phosphorus chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Self&#8208;Organizing Lithium Bonds for High Energy Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MAPOSS, featuring well&#8208;defined composition and precise 3D architecture, served as a model to probe Li&#8211;Si interactions. Morphological/structural analyses and DFT revealed &#8220;dynamic self&#8208;organizing lithium bonds,&#8221; where Li cooperatively interacts with core silicon and side&#8208;chain carbonyls, enabling reversible Li+ ions storage. A graphite&#8208;anode binder, prepared by copolymerizing MAPOSS with functional units, delivered &#12297;450&#8239;mAh&#8239;g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C for 250 cycles.








ABSTRACT
To enhance the electrochemical performance of silicon electrodes, it is essential to comprehensively understand their underlying lithium storage mechanisms. Unfortunately, the vast diversity of silicon anode types and compositions complicates efforts to accurately predict and validate these reaction processes. Accordingly, a structurally well&#8208;defined silicon&#8208;based model compound is in great need. Thus, we select methacrylate polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (MAPOSS) as the subject for studying the lithium&#8208;silicon bonding mechanism due to its clear chemical structure and composition. Through detailed characterization of the morphological and chemical structural changes of MAPOSS before and after cycling, our results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the synergistic interaction (here termed as &#8220;Dynamic Self&#8208;Organizing Lithium Bonds&#8221;) between Si atoms in the core and carbonyl (C = O) groups in the side arms of MAPOSS promotes reversible dynamic Li+ ions storage. Density functional theory simulations further support this deduction. Furthermore, MAPOSS is employed as a binder in graphite anodes after polymerization. At 0.2 C, the resulting half&#8208;cell exhibits an impressive specific capacity exceeding 450&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 250 cycles. This study demonstrates that the integration of MAPOSS into the full cell configuration allows for a reduction in the N/P ratio and is expected to improve the overall energy density of the battery.

         <title>Arylhydrazines: Convenient Homogeneous Reductants for Scalable Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive cross&#8208;couplings enable efficient C&#8211;C bond formation but are limited by the heterogeneity of Zn or costly reagents like TDAE. We report arylhydrazines as inexpensive, convenient reductants for Ni&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8211;sp3 coupling of aryl halides and secondary alkyl iodides. Mechanistic studies support hydrazine&#8208;mediated NiII reduction for a NiI/NiIII cycle, delivering improved yields, reproducibility, and scalability over Zn&#8208;based methods.








ABSTRACT
Reductive cross&#8208;couplings have emerged as a powerful strategy for forging C&#8211;C bonds directly from electrophiles, circumventing the need for preformed organometallic reagents, yet they often suffer from limitations associated with heterogeneous reductants like Zn (e.g., poor reproducibility and scalability) or costly homogeneous alternatives such as TDAE. Inspired by prior explorations of hydrazide chemistry, we disclose arylhydrazines as inexpensive, readily available homogeneous sacrificial reductants that enable Ni&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8208;sp3 cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with secondary alkyl iodides under mild, operationally simple conditions using a NiII precursor, bipyridine ligand, and hindered amine base. Optimization, substrate scope studies, and direct comparisons reveal superior yields and selectivity relative to Zn&#8208;based methods, particularly for heterocyclic and electron&#8208;rich partners, while calorimetry&#8208;guided safety assessments and decagram&#8208;scale demonstrations highlight enhanced thermal control, reproducibility, and practicality. Mechanistic investigations via UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, 19F NMR, and reaction calorimetry support a pathway involving hydrazine&#8208;mediated NiII reduction to initiate a NiI/NiIII cycle, with benign byproducts (N2 and arene), positioning arylhydrazines as versatile reagents for executing reductive coupling on scale.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Engineering Enables Kinetic Control of Chirality Transfer in Side Chain Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering at the side chain terminus dictates dipole&#8208;mediated inversion and multiplexed chirality transfer across hierarchical assembly pathways in chiral domino&#8208;type azobenzene polymers.








ABSTRACT
Chirality transfer across hierarchical architectures represents a pivotal and underexplored challenge in the design of functional chiral materials. Through molecular engineering integrating chiral &#945;&#8208;terminal groups with electronically tunable azobenzene (Azo) side chains, we demonstrate that in kinetically trapped aggregates of side chain Azo polymers, the dipole moment of the chromophore, modulated by terminal electron&#8208;donating (Donor, D) or withdrawing (Acceptor, A) substituents, dictates the absolute inversion of the resulting supramolecular helix. The substituent&#8208;dependent dipole reorientation cascades into long&#8208;range helical reorganization via &#960;&#8208;&#960; and van der Waals cooperativity, ultimately governing whether chirality transfer follows thermodynamic preference, undergoes inversion, or exhibits multiplexed behavior. This electronically driven chirality inversion transcends classical steric models and establishes a transformative framework for designing adaptive chiral materials with programmable handedness, offering promising applications in photonic circuits, enantioselective nanosensors, and bioinspired metamaterials.

         <title>Tri(Thiophene&#8208;Nitrile) Covalent Organic Frameworks With Low HOMO/LUMO Donor/Acceptor for High&#8208;Potential&#8208;Plateau Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tri(thiophene&#8208;nitrile) covalent organic framework cathode with low HOMO/LUMO donor/acceptor unlocks a flat and high redox potential of 1.2&#160;V and starts fast 18 e&#8722; CF3SO3&#8722;/NH4+ coordination to provide a high capacity (335 mAh g&#8722;1). Integrated high voltage and capacity give Zn&#8208;organic battery superior energy density (402&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (70,000 cycles).








ABSTRACT
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring desirable redox&#8208;active sites have become competitive cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). However, multi&#8208;active COFs, albeit with high capacity, are often confined to their sloping and low redox potential (&lt;0.8&#160;V) caused by high molecular orbital energy levels (HOMO/LUMO) of active moieties. Here we report a capacity&#8208;voltage trade&#8208;off&#8208;breaking design of COFs by pairing low&#8208;HOMO trithiophene donor (&#8722;6.04&#160;eV) with low&#8208;LUMO trinitrile acceptor (&#8722;3.82&#160;eV) via robust olefin linkages (TN&#8208;COF), using high&#8208;LUMO triazine acceptor (&#8722;1.75&#160;eV) as the counterpart (TA&#8208;COF). The tri(thiophene&#8208;nitrile) donor&#8208;acceptor enables low HOMO/LUMO energy levels (&#8722;3.98/&#8722;5.94&#160;eV) for TN&#8208;COF cathode, thus unlocking a flat and high redox potential of 1.2&#160;V compared to TA&#8208;COF (0.9&#160;V). An 18&#8208;electron CF3SO3&#8722;/NH4+ (de)coordination process is activated per hexagonal tri(thiophene&#8208;nitrile) unit in TN&#8208;COF cathode with ultralow activation energy (0.17&#160;eV). This facilitates 98.2% utilization of C&#8722;S/C&#8801;N active sites to liberate high capacity of 335 mAh g&#8722;1 (vs. 80.1%/268 mAh g&#8722;1 for TA&#8208;COF). The ideal combination of high voltage and capacity gives TN&#8208;COF cathode superior energy density (402&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and ultralong life (70,000 cycles). This finding widens the design philosophy of high&#8208;voltage&#8208;capacity COFs via HOMO/LUMO energy engineering for advanced ZOBs.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Donor&#8211;Acceptor [17]Helicenes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the precise synthesis of two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) [17]helicenes, the longest chiral carbohelicenes reported to date. Through rational molecular design, the incorporation of a D&#8211;A system into the helicene scaffold enhances the fluorescence quantum yield, resulting in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high dissymmetry factor (|glum| &#8764; 10&#8722;2). These properties highlight the promising potential of these compounds for chiral optoelectronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Here we present a five&#8208;step synthesis of two circular polarized light emitting donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) [17]helicenes. The concise yet high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy was achieved by dedicated precursor design, with bond&#8208;order control and substitution effects, for photocyclization. The structures and chiroptical properties of D&#8211;A [17]helicenes were comprehensively characterized by NMR, HRMS, UV&#8211;vis, CD, fluorescence and CPL spectroscopies, as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By introducing D&#8211;A system into helicene scaffold, we demonstrate a nearly 10&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence quantum yield compared to the unsubstituted [14]helicene, due to an enhanced fluorescence emission rate (kf). The emission wavelength can be tuned by introducing different functional groups. D&#8211;A [17]helicenes emitting circularly polarized light with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of up to 1 &#215; 10&#8722;2. DFT calculations reveal that D&#8211;A functionalization increases the oscillator strengths (f) thereby increasing kf. This highly efficient synthetic strategy not only facilitates the synthesis of the longest chiral helicene reported to date but also establishes design principles for developing chiral long helicenes with circularly polarized light emission.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Dynamic Polymer Networks From Heteroaffinity Cross&#8208;Links to Multivalent Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a method to modularly assemble oligomeric binding proteins, like streptavidin, using heterobifunctional cross&#8208;linkers that have both a strong&#8208; and a weak&#8208;affinity binding moiety. These dynamic cross&#8208;linkers enable the assembly of polymer networks with unique meta&#8208;stable nonequilibrium topologies, and that exhibit chemically tunable and stimulus&#8208;responsive dynamics.








ABSTRACT
Dynamic polymer networks (DPN) leverage transient cross&#8208;linking to yield macroscopic materials that exhibit self&#8208;healing and environmentally responsive behaviors. Despite the broad scope of chemical interactions available for cross&#8208;linking, imbuing those transient interactions into biologically compatible materials is difficult because many chemistries are incompatible with aqueous conditions, and it is difficult to tune preexisting biological interactions that have evolved over millions of years for specificity. To enable the assembly of chemically tunable and biologically compatible DPNs, we have developed a set of bifunctional, heteroaffinity cross&#8208;linkers (HAX) where the reactive moieties have different binding affinities to the same binding sites of an oligomeric protein. The use of cross&#8208;linking moieties with vastly different dissociation rates enables purification of protein modules with monodisperse HAX valencies. Assembly of DPNs from stoichiometrically identical pairs of protein modules then yields unique, metastable, nonequilibrium network topologies. Here, we demonstrate these concepts using the well&#8208;studied avidin&#8208;biotin interaction chemistry. We also develop a pH&#8208;sensitive HAX that yields DPNs with robust pH&#8208;responsive assembly dynamics, and demonstrate how this DPN can be made into a magnetically responsive, molecular delivery system to low&#8208;pH regions, such as tumor microenvironments.

         <title>FeCoN6 Sites Unlock Superior Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage Through Synergizing Capture&#8208;Release and Orbital&#8208;Mediated Charge Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCo dual&#8208;atom sites unlock a dual&#8208;mechanism synergy: (1) the intrinsic heteroatomic nature provides optimized Na+ capture&#8208;release pathways; (2) the strong d&#8208;d orbital coupling induces an orbital&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;delocalization effect (OMCD), electronically optimizing the Na+ diffusion kinetics. This synergistic strategy breaks the kinetic bottleneck for sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors, enabling ultrafast and highly stable Na+ storage.








ABSTRACT
Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SHCs) are severely hindered by sluggish sodiation kinetics in conventional anodes. Single&#8208;atom sites, though promising, suffer from localized d&#8208;orbitals that induce overly strong Na+ binding, creating a kinetic bottleneck. Herein, we design heteroatomic FeCo dual&#8208;atom sites (FeCoN6) that unlock a dual&#8208;mechanism synergy for fast and durable Na+ storage. Theoretical&#8208;experimental evidence confirms that strong d&#8211;d orbital coupling induces an orbital&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;delocalization (OMCD) effect, which downshifts the d&#8208;band center to moderate Na+ binding affinity. Meanwhile, the intrinsic heteroatomic nature of the FeCoN6 sites provides a stepped energy landscape for optimized Na+ capture&#8208;release pathways. This synergy between electronic OMCD modulation and the kinetic capture&#8208;release model significantly lowers the diffusion barrier. Consequently, the FeCo dual&#8208;atom nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon anode exhibits dominant pseudocapacitive kinetics, superior rate capability (225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1), and exceptional durability. The full SHC delivers a high energy density of 165&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 23&#160;W kg&#8722;1, retains 108&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 9424&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and achieves 90% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles. This study establishes that engineering heteroatomic sites to leverage both intrinsic functional heterogeneity and electronic delocalization is a powerful strategy to overcome kinetic limitations in energy storage.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Vacancy Induced Compressive Strain Localization in RuO2 Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd doping followed by selective leaching created cation&#8208;vacancy&#8211;induced localized compressive strain. This strategy shortened localized Ru&#9472;O bonds, strengthened Ru&#9472;O covalency, and raised the Ru valence to +&#160;4.35. The resulting dual electronic&#8211;structural modulation optimizes *O to *OOH formation energetics, accelerates the intrinsic OER kinetics, and suppresses over&#8208;oxidation&#8208;driven dissolution.








Abstract
Designing acid&#8208;stable RuO2 catalysts capable of overcoming the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off remains pivotal for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we introduce a cation&#8208;vacancy engineering strategy to generate localized compressive strain in RuO2 by electrochemically leaching Cd from a pre&#8208;doped lattice. This strain modulation simultaneously elevates the Ru valence state (+4.35) and strengthens Ru&#9472;O covalent bonds, optimizing *OH/*O/*OOH adsorption energetics while suppressing over&#8208;oxidation. The resulting VCd&#8208;RuO2 catalyst achieves an overpotential of 203&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#160;M HClO4. Integrated into a PEMWE, it sustains &gt;600&#160;h operation at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a voltage degradation rate of 0.1&#160;mV h&#8722;1. The MEA based on VCd&#8208;RuO2 required cell voltages outperformed commercial RuO2 by 120&#8211;180&#160;mV at industrially relevant current densities (0.5&#8211;1.5 A cm&#8722;2), thereby demonstrating significant energy efficiency. Multiscale analyses confirm that compressive strain stabilizes high&#8208;valence Ru sites through enhanced orbital overlap, reconciling catalytic activity with structural durability. This work establishes vacancy&#8208;driven strain engineering as a universal approach for designing robust, Ir&#8208;free OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Recyclable Thermoset Enabled by Copolymer of Elemental Sulfur and Acrylate With Controlled Disulfide Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the successful synthesis of a disulfide&#8208;rich copolymer from elemental sulfur (S8) and acrylates through anionic hybrid copolymerization (AHCP). This copolymer serves as a curing agent for epoxy, polyurethane, and unsaturated polyester resins, producing thermosets with excellent reprocessability, strong UV&#8208;blocking capability, and full chemical recyclability, addressing both plastic waste and sulfur surplus.








ABSTRACT
Thermoset polymers have found a number of applications. However, their recycling faces a challenge due to their chemically crosslinked structure, which brings environmental pollution. Introduction of dynamic disulfide linkages can overcome this obstacle in principle. Yet, the disulfide compounds used to build the dynamic bonds are very limited and expensive, making their practical applications rather difficult. In this study, we present copolymer of elemental sulfur (S8) and acrylate with controlled disulfide linkages synthesized via anionic hybrid copolymerization (AHCP). Such a copolymer can serve as a curing agent for conventional thermosetting resins including epoxy, polyurethane, and unsaturated polyester. The resulting thermoset demonstrates remarkable reprocessability, retaining over 86% of its maximum stress and strain at break after five cycles of processing at 120&#176;C and pressure of 10&#160;MPa. It also exhibits strong UV&#8208;blocking capability with zero transmittance in the ultraviolet range. Particularly, the thermoset is recyclable. Namely, it can degrade into oligomers in the presence of S8, which can be reused as curing agents for new thermosets or directly employed as robust adhesives for diverse substrates. The precise synthesis of polymer with controlled disulfide linkages provides a platform to transform conventional thermosets into high&#8208;performance recyclable materials.

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogenation Pathway to Redirect CO2 Electroreduction From Ethylene to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By hierarchically assembling branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI)/perfluorinated polymer (PT) interfaces, interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond networks are reconstructed to regulate competing hydrogenation pathways. This microenvironment engineering promotes surface *H&#8208;mediated Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood hydrogenation while suppressing solvent&#8208;driven Eley&#8211;Rideal processes, favoring C&#8211;O bond retention and efficient ethanol production.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethanol faces a fundamental challenge: competing ethylene formation through shared C2 intermediates. While previous studies focused on modifying catalyst electronic structures or increasing *CO coverage, the critical role of competitive hydrogenation pathways remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the selectivity between ethanol and ethylene is governed by the balance between Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (surface *H) and Eley&#8211;Rideal (solvent H) hydrogenation mechanisms. Through hierarchically assembled BPEI/PT interfaces, we dynamically modulate this balance by reconstructing interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond networks without altering catalyst electronic properties. In situ Raman spectroscopy captures enhanced *OCHCH2/*OCHCH3 intermediates, directly correlating ethanol selectivity with suppressed ER pathway. Combined experimental and theoretical studies establish quantitative relationships between hydrogen&#8208;bond strength and pathway selectivity. This strategy achieves 38.7% ethanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 900&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 on CuO&#8208;derived catalysts (116% improvement) and 53% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 on CuAg systems&#8212;among the highest reported efficiencies. Our findings reveal that controlling competitive hydrogenation pathways through interfacial engineering provides an independent parameter for steering CO2 reduction selectivity.

         <title>Hexavalent Iridium Sites Drive Highly Efficient and Selective Chlorine Evolution via a Two&#8208;Step Chemical&#8208;Electrochemical Cycle Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a spinel&#8208;type electrocatalyst featuring isolated hexavalent IrVI sites which drives highly efficient and selective chlorine evolution, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a nearly 100% selectivity, and a record energy efficiency of 83.5% at &#8764; 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Such high activity can be attributed to that the IrVI sites enable the spontaneous adsorption, bonding, and oxidation of Cl&#8722; to generate Cl2.








ABSTRACT
Chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is pivotal to the chlor&#8208;alkali industry, while its operation still relies on the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) developed decades ago, which is hindered by high costs, moderate selectivity, and limited energy efficiency. Here, we present a spinel&#8208;type hexavalent iridium single&#8208;site electrocatalyst (spinel&#8208;iso&#8208;IrVI) via strategic modulation of delocalized electron distribution that demonstrates exceptional CER performance. This catalyst operates with an ultralow overpotential of 27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (57&#160;mV for commercial DSA), a nearly 100% CER selectivity across a wide potential range, and a record energy efficiency of 83.5% at an industrial&#8208;level current density of &#8764;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. At the overpotential of 100&#160;mV, spinel&#8208;iso&#8208;IrVI delivers a mass activity of 9671&#160;mA mgRu+Ir&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency of 0.278 s&#8722;1, surpassing those of the benchmark DSA by over 386&#8208;fold and 20&#8208;fold, respectively. The high&#8208;performance of spinel&#8208;iso&#8208;IrVI results in a low production cost of US$0.04 per kilogram of chlorine. Mechanism studies reveal a two&#8208;step chemical&#8208;electrochemical cycle reaction mechanism, in which the chemical reaction step involves a spontaneous redox reaction triggered by hexavalent IrVI sites. This process enables the spontaneous adsorption, bonding, and oxidation of Cl&#8722; to generate Cl2, thereby significantly boosting the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Beyond Excimer: Engineering Pyrene Stacking With Mechanical Bonds for Tunable Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of pyrene&#8208;functionalized [1]rotaxanes, including ones with tunable triple&#8208;layered pyrene stacking, has demonstrated pyrene stacking with mechanical bonds. This approach not only provides more in&#8208;depth fundamental insights into pyrene excimer emissions but also offers critical design principles for developing advanced chiral luminescent materials.








ABSTRACT
Aiming to deepen the fundamental understanding of how hierarchical molecular packing governs the overall photophysical properties in multi&#8208;chromophore systems, engineering pyrene stacking with mechanical bonds has been successfully realized, leading to the construction of a novel family of pyrene&#8208;functionalized [1]rotaxanes, particularly ones with tunable triple&#8208;layered pyrene stacking. The precisely controlled pyrene excimer conformations in these structures enable adjustable photophysical behaviors, particularly in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), including tunable luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum), invertible handedness, and programmable emission wavelengths. Notably, introducing a third pyrene unit into tris&#8208;pyrene&#8208;functionalized [1]rotaxanes further modulates CPL properties through synergistic or antagonistic interactions, as further confirmed by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) simulations, revealing a previously unobserved stacking effect. This correlation between spatial stacking and photophysical response not only provides more in&#8208;depth fundamental insights for pyrene excimer emissions but also offers critical design principles for developing advanced chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Unnatural Amino Acid and Emerging Chemistry Approaches to Map RNA&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights emerging chemistries for mapping RNA&#8211;protein interactions, including genetically encoded unnatural amino acids, novel photocrosslinkers, and non&#8208;photoactivatable crosslinking systems. We compare their mechanisms, reactivity and applications, outlining how these next&#8208;generation tools enable higher&#8208;resolution, site&#8208;specific interrogation of dynamic ribonucleoprotein networks.








Abstract
RNA serves as both a genetic messenger and a functional non&#8208;coding molecule, with its activity relying on interactions with diverse proteins. Characterizing RNA&#8211;protein interactions remains challenging, particularly for dynamic or low&#8208;abundance complexes. Traditional crosslinking methods, such as UV&#8208;254&#160;nm irradiation and formaldehyde fixation, suffer from low efficiency, poor specificity, and broad reactivity, limiting their utility for high&#8208;resolution interactome mapping. Recent advances in genetic code expansion (GCE) and unnatural amino acid (UAA) incorporation now enable chemoselective, site&#8208;specific crosslinking chemistries that circumvent these limitations. This review highlights classes of crosslinkable UAAs, including benzophenone&#8208;, diazirine&#8208;, and aryl azide&#8208;based moieties, which have been used for photo&#8208;induced covalent capture of RNA&#8211;protein interactions. Next&#8208;generation modalities, such as acetophenone derivatives, halogenated UAAs, bifunctional UAAs, acyl silanes, diaryl nitrones, and photoactivatable systems further expand the toolkit for photocrosslinking and bioorthogonal labelling. Beyond UV&#8208;based approaches, latent bioreactive UAAs and proximity&#8208;induced chemistries exploit electrophile&#8211;nucleophile substitution and masked acylating agents to enable covalent capture under physiological conditions. Together, these strategies provide unprecedented control over reactivity, temporal resolution and site specificity, advancing RNA&#8208;targeted proteomics. Continued innovation in UAA&#8208;based chemistry promise to transform how RNA&#8211;protein complexes are interrogated and manipulated with molecular precision.

         <title>Reaction Discovery in Porous Materials Using Periodic Nanoreactor Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autonomous reaction discovery using ab initio nanoreactor dynamics in combination with periodic density functional theory (DFT) computations elucidates the selective catalytic reduction of NO to N2${\rm N}_2$ and side reactions forming N2O${\rm N}_2{\rm O}$. This enables the autonomous discovery of reaction mechanisms including the Br&#248;nsted sites and proton shuttles, leading to a complex chemical reaction network. Free energy barriers of selected reaction pathways are provided.








Abstract
Understanding catalytic processes is essential for advancing energy&#8208;efficient molecular transformations. In heterogeneous catalysis, porous materials such as zeolites play a central role due to their structural complexity and large surface area. Here, we present a periodic ab initio nanoreactor molecular dynamics (NMD) approach to investigate the reaction network of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO over copper&#8208;exchanged chabazite zeolites. This method enables autonomous discovery of both established and previously unreported pathways, including a water&#8208;assisted tautomerization mechanism that facilitates N2${\rm N}_2$ formation and a novel radical&#8208;driven route to N2O${\rm N}_2{\rm O}$. Notably, NMD simulations also capture reactivity involving Br&#248;nsted acid sites of the zeolite framework. By using automated reaction detection, a comprehensive reaction network was constructed, which elucidates the formation of both desired and undesired products. Refinement of the reaction path including free energy corrections by computing the phonon spectrum allows to make quantitative statements about the discovered reactions. The results of this work provide insight into the side&#8208;reactions of SCR, and also demonstrate the versatility of NMD for agnostic reaction discovery of complex systems such as heterogeneous&#160;catalysis.

         <title>A General Strategy to Access Pharmaceutically Relevant Pyridines from Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a bio&#8208;inspired ironporphyrin&#8208;catalyzed strategy to convert nitroarenes into pharmaceutically relevant aminopyridines via C5 carbon deletion. The method is also applied to the synthesis of unsubstituted bioactive pyridines through ipso&#8208;carbon deletion. It exhibits broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and enables drug diversification, including the synthesis of a nimesulide&#8208;derived pyridine with enhanced molecular docking and binding profiles. This work establishes a distinctive platform for heterocycle construction with direct implications for pharmaceutical design and molecular remodeling.








Abstract
The incorporation of nitrogen atoms into aromatic systems is a cornerstone of modern drug design, enabling precise modulation of molecular properties and enhanced bioactivity. Here, we report a general and efficient strategy for the first&#8208;time conversion of nitroarenes into pharmaceutically relevant pyridine heterocycles via a nitrene&#8208;mediated transformation. This process is driven by a bio&#8208;inspired iron&#8211;porphyrin catalyst that uniquely serves as a singlet oxygen reservoir, enabling the formation of aminopyridines via C5&#8208;carbon deletion through a controlled ring&#8208;editing cascade. The unprecedented selective C5&#8208;carbon deletion provides a powerful new retrosynthetic logic for heterocycle construction. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, tolerates a wide range of functional groups, and offers broad substrate scope with high regioselectivity. Furthermore, the method's ability to efficiently convert nitroarenes into bioactive pyridine scaffolds via ipso&#8208;carbon deletion underscores its practicality and step economy. This modular platform also streamlines the synthesis of drug&#8208;like scaffolds from simple building blocks, as demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of nimesulide derivatives with improved molecular docking and binding profiles. Overall, this work showcases a distinctive catalytic paradigm for heterocycle construction with direct implications for pharmaceutical development and molecular remodeling.

         <title>A Convergent Hybrid Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Tirzepatide: Tangential Flow Filtration Assisted Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Desulfurization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;gram synthesis of tirzepatide was accomplished using native chemical ligation (NCL) and telescoped desulfurization of the ligated peptide enabled by tangential flow filtration (TFF) purification. The integration of TFF with NCL presents an industrially viable process for large&#8208;scale peptide production. 








Abstract
The development of scalable and efficient manufacturing of high&#8208;volume complex synthetic peptides and proteins, like tirzepatide (TZP, 1), faces major hurdles due to the limitations of traditional Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS). To enable the commercial synthesis of tirzepatide, we pioneered an innovative four&#8208;fragment convergent hybrid SPPS/LPPS strategy combining their individual strengths. Integrating advanced techniques, like flow chemistry for fragment condensation and nanofiltration for intermediate purification, ensures high efficiency and scalability, setting a new standard for large&#8208;scale production. Given the broader reliance on inefficient linear SPPS in the field, our work underscores the potential of hybrid synthesis strategies to transform peptide manufacturing. The convergent approach allows for the simultaneous synthesis of high purity peptide fragments, significantly reducing overall manufacturing time and increasing API throughput. Concurrently, we established a two&#8208;fragment route leveraging Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) followed by tandem desulfurization. This method achieves the chemoselective coupling of unprotected peptide fragments in aqueous media, without epimerization. Crucially, we employed tangential flow filtration (TFF) to effectively purify intermediates between ligation and desulfurization, circumventing solvent&#8208;intensive steps. This NCL/TFF combination offers a powerful, orthogonal, and greener path to TZP, representing a meaningful innovation in synthetic peptide process chemistry.

To enable the commercial synthesis of tirzepatide, we pioneered an innovative four-fragment convergent hybrid SPPS/LPPS strategy combining their individual strengths. Integrating advanced techniques, like flow chemistry for fragment condensation and nanofiltration for intermediate purification, ensures high efficiency and scalability, setting a new standard for large-scale production. Given the broader reliance on inefficient linear SPPS in the field, our work underscores the potential of hybrid synthesis strategies to transform peptide manufacturing. The convergent approach allows for the simultaneous synthesis of high purity peptide fragments, significantly reducing overall manufacturing time and increasing API throughput. Concurrently, we established a two-fragment route leveraging Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) followed by tandem desulfurization. This method achieves the chemoselective coupling of unprotected peptide fragments in aqueous media, without epimerization. Crucially, we employed tangential flow filtration (TFF) to effectively purify intermediates between ligation and desulfurization, circumventing solvent-intensive steps. This NCL/TFF combination offers a powerful, orthogonal, and greener path to TZP, representing a meaningful innovation in synthetic peptide process chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrophobic Association Enabled Salt&#8208;Concentrated all&#8208;Cellulose Hydrogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylcellulose and cotton cellulose are combined to create a hydrogel electrolyte containing concentrated ZnCl2. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic association effect that enhances the matrix. At high temperatures, the hydrogel electrolyte provides mechanical and electrochemical stabilization, enabling a zinc&#8208;ion capacitor with a 10,000 cycle lifetime and 85.4% capacity retention.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have great potential in electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high flexibility, conductivity, and safety. However, at high temperatures, the mechanical stability and ionic conductivity of hydrogel electrolytes are compromised due to water evaporation and unstabilization of polymer matrix. Herein, we propose a salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte with its matrix showing hydrophobic association effect upon heating for achieving high&#8208;temperature adaptability. The cotton cellulose supports a stable homogeneous polymer&#8208;salt phase in the hydrogel electrolytes. The methylcellulose works through temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions, maintaining the stability of the salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel over a wide temperature range. An all&#8208;biobased hydrogel with both mechanical and conductive stability is realized at high temperatures (more than 60&#160;&#176;C). We have demonstrated a zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor with a high specific capacity of 250.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 120&#160;&#176;C and 85.4% retention for 10,000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. This work is expected to provide a general strategy to achieve high&#8208;temperature hydrogel electrolyte.

         <title>Macrocyclic Molecular Glues for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP Interaction: Affinity and Cooperativity in an Inverse Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are effective molecular glues to stabilize the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP interaction. Linker length modulation uncovered an inverse correlation between the macrocycle binding affinity to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and its cooperativity in 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP stabilization. Co&#8208;crystal structures of these macrocycles in the composite 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP binding pocket revealed structural clues behind this affinity and cooperativity interplay.








Abstract
Molecular glues (MGs) stabilize protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) by simultaneously binding two or more proteins at their composite interface. Macrocycles present attractive properties as MGs, including large contact surfaces to address the often flat and undefined composite PPI interfaces, but their structure&#8208;based design has remained intangible. We have designed peptidomimetic macrocycles capable of enhancing the PPI between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a regulatory transcription factor. Biophysical characterization of these MGs revealed the importance of optimized linker length, displaying a reduced entropic cost compared to the linear counterparts, while preserving key contacts with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3. Binding assays demonstrated that the macrocycles selectively and cooperatively stabilized the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP complex, with an intriguing inverse relationship between intrinsic binding affinity to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and cooperativity in PPI stabilization. Ternary co&#8208;crystal structures of the macrocycles binding at the composite 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP interface provided a molecular rationale for the affinity and cooperativity differences. Overall, this study highlights structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic features that guide effective macrocyclic MG design and brings forward the crucial interplay of affinity and cooperativity in stabilizing PPIs.

         <title>Selective Hydrodemethylation of Methylalkylbenzenes on Potassium Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective catalytic hydrodealkylation of methylalkylbenzenes on carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride is reported. The reaction exhibits a reactivity trend of 1&#176; &#8764; 2&#176; &#8764; 3&#176;&#160;&lt;&#160;CH3, which is opposite to traditional dealkylation and hydrodealkylation. DFT calculations on the (001) facet of KH with ortho&#8208;ethyltoluene suggest that selectivity is controlled by the ipso&#8208;H* attack from the KH surface, leading to the direct removal of CH3 as CH4 with a lower rate&#8208;limiting barrier than the removal of C2H5.








Abstract
Dealkylation and hydrodealkylation of alkylaromatics are key processes in the petrochemical industry. The typical susceptibility of alkyl groups to removal via both dealkylation and hydrodealkylation reactions in aromatic compounds follows the order CH3&#160;&lt;&#160;1&#176;&#160;&lt;&#160;2&#176;&#160;&lt; 3&#176;, with methyl and tertiary alkyl groups having the slowest and fastest reaction rates, respectively. Here, we report the selective catalytic hydrodealkylation of methylalkylbenzenes using carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) under a H2 atmosphere, which exhibits an opposite reactivity pattern compared with that described above. This trend is observed across various methylalkylbenzenes and also aligns with the higher reactivity of toluene compared to other monoalkylbenzenes. Density functional theory calculations on ortho&#8208;ethyltoluene as a model substrate rationalize the experimental results by indicating a lower rate&#8208;limiting energy barrier for the direct removal of the methyl group as methane relative to the removal of the ethyl group as ethane on the (001) facet of KH. Our study reveals that the potassium hydride surface exhibits a distinct hydrodealkylation mechanism, characterized by selectivity for hydrodemethylation, which contrasts with that of zeolites, Mo&#8208; or Pt&#8208;based hydrodealkylation catalysts, and homogeneous free&#8208;radical pathways.

         <title>A Biocatalytic Platform for the Synthesis of Organofunctional Silanes and Siloxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofunctional silanes are valuable in materials science as crosslinkers and adhesion promoters, but their synthesis typically requires costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts. We developed a sustainable biocatalytic platform for enantioselective synthesis of ester&#8208; and cyano&#8208;functionalized silanes. Directed evolution of Thermus amyloliquefaciens protoglobin (TamPgb) yielded enzymes that cyclopropanate vinyl silanes/siloxanes with diazo compounds or N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as carbene precursors (up to 2500 TTN, &gt;99% dr/ee). This safer, practical method avoids precious metals and simplifies purification.








Abstract
Organofunctional silanes are highly useful reagents in material science, functioning as effective crosslinking agents and adhesion promoters. Traditionally, their synthesis relies on precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts, which require downstream purification and increase overall costs. Herein, we present a green and sustainable biocatalytic platform for the enantioselective synthesis of diverse organofunctional silanes bearing ester and cyano groups. Directed evolution of Thermus amyloliquefaciens protoglobin (TamPgb) produced efficient enzymes for cyclopropanation of vinyl silanes and siloxanes using diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as carbene precursors with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (up to 2500 TTN, &gt;99% dr, &gt;99% ee). Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that N&#8208;tosylhydrazones can serve as carbene precursors in enzymatic reactions, providing a safer and more practical alternative for industrial applications.

         <title>Optical Vortex&#8208;Induced Chiral Nanotubes of Tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin for Enantioselective Catalysis of Dihydroxy Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a light&#8208;driven strategy to bias achiral porphyrin monomers into enantiomerically enriched J&#8208;aggregate nanotubes by harnessing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of optical vortices (OVs), and serve as effective organocatalysts for the selective oxidation of D&#8208; and L&#8208;dihydroxy phenylalanine (DOPA), establishing a direct link between supramolecular chirality and enantioselective photocatalysis.








Abstract
Achieving symmetry breaking and controlling the initial chirality of molecular assemblies are crucial for understanding the origin of chirality in nature. However, weak chiral interactions among small organic precursors render this process inherently difficult to manipulate. Herein, we report a light&#8208;driven chiral assembly of tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (TPPS) into enantiomerically enriched nanotubes using optical vortices (OVs), enabling chiral catalysis of D/L&#8208;dihydroxy phenylalanine successfully. The resulting TPPS nanotubes comprise plus (P)&#8208; and minus (M)&#8208;type aggregates, each exhibiting a distinct circular dichroism signal at 490&#160;nm that correlates with the use of a positive or negative OV topological charge (&#8467;$\ell$). Mechanistic investigations show that OVs trap TPPS monomers bearing the opposite &#8467;$\ell$ value, thereby inducing rotation and distortion of nascent aggregates through optical forces and hydrodynamic coupling. Our findings establish a new paradigm for light&#8208;controlled chiral assembly via weak interactions and offer insight into supramolecular symmetry breaking for chiral catalysis.

         <title>Robot&#8208;Assisted Reconstruction and Control of the Pechmann Reaction Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an in&#8208;house built robotic platform, we systematically explored the classic Pechmann reaction across a wide range of reaction conditions, uncovering a rich and previously unexplored network of reactivity. This approach led to the discovery of 11 novel products, including rare benzofurans formed through non&#8208;classical pathways. These results highlight how automated synthesis can not only map complex reaction spaces but also actively guide organic transformations toward unexpected outcomes

Abstract
A robotic platform was deployed to map the distributions of products and by&#8208;products of the classic Pechmann reaction over a four&#8208;dimensional &#8220;hyperspace&#8221; of conditions. This systematic scan reveals the presence of 15 products of which 11 are unprecedented, including those forming by unusual mechanistic routes. In turn, the knowledge of the hyperspace allows for the deduction of causal relationships between the forming species, ultimately enabling the reconstruction of the underlying reaction network. The hyperspace approach provides a more complete description of organic reactions as dynamic networks which, depending on conditions, can be steered toward different outcomes.

         <title>NADH Mimic&#8208;Decorated Coordination Capsules for Biomimetic Capture of NO and Electrocatalytic Reduction to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) mimic decorated coordination capsule is reported, which encapsulates a glutathione analogue to echo the native S&#8208;nitrosoglutathione reductase for biomimetic NO capture and electroreduction to NH3. This is the first case of customizing an enzyme&#8208;like &#8220;capture&#8208;activation&#8208;conversion&#8221; pathway for biomimetic NO electroreduction, exhibiting Michaelis&#8211;Menten mechanism and nearly 100% Faraday efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainable conversion of NO offers a promising technology for artificial nitrogen cycle, but faces challenges in integrating electrocatalysis with NO capture. Herein, a biomimetic NO capture&#8208;activation&#8208;conversion strategy was firstly formulated by encapsulating N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) within a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) mimic&#8208;containing coordination capsule, enabling efficiently NH3 electrosynthesis. The installed NADH mimics onto the capsule interacted with the highly reactive NO&#8208;adduct generated from NAC within the microenvironment akin to the pocket of enzyme, facilitating intramolecular hydride transfer of the substrate&#8208;involving clathrate, accompanied by the formation of oxidated NAD+ mimics. Subsequently, the cobalt&#8208;based coordination capsule consecutively reserved e&#8722; from cathode while donating 2e&#8722; to the NAD+ mimic simultaneously for active cofactor recovered and recycle. This coordination capsule&#8208;mediated biomimetic system exhibited enzymatic kinetics following the Michaelis&#8211;Menten mechanism in the electrochemical NO reduction and realized almost 100% Faraday efficiency at potentials below &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a substantial NH3 yield rate of 121.6 &#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3 VRHE, ranking among the optimal electrocatalytic NO performance ever achieved, offering an attractive avenue toward renewable electricity&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation exploiting bioinspired artificial catalyst.

         <title>Unlocking the Secrets of Divergent Sodium Storage Performances in Sb and Bi Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi and Sb form alloys with sodium that exhibit similar crystal structures and identical stoichiometries, while their electrochemical behaviors demonstrate significant differences. For Sb anodes, poor volume change tolerance, interfacial instability and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics collectively lead to a Na+ blockade effect, which disrupts the sequential phase transitions and consequently deteriorates the electrochemical performance. While the sequential phase transitions in Bi anodes, mediated by ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion diffusion, exhibit remarkable reversibility during (de)intercalation processes.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type anode materials have garnered significant interest for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the underlying mechanisms affecting their rate capability and cycling stability remain inadequately elucidated. In this study, we systematically compare the electrochemical performance of Sb and Bi anodes, which belong to group VA and exhibit analogous sodium alloy composition. The results reveal that the marked performance disparity arises from a &#8220;blockade effect&#8221; of Na+ within the Sb alloy intermediate phase, which impedes the phase transformation kinetics. This not only deteriorates rate capability but also induces structural degradation during cycling. In contrast, the Bi anode undergoes a sequential phase transition that enables rapid Na+ diffusion and promotes the formation of a thin and uniform solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). As a result, the Bi anode delivers a high capacity of 325.1 mAh g&#8722;1 even at an ultrahigh current rate of 155.8C (1C = 385&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and maintains a specific capacity of 323 mAh g&#8722;1 (88% retention) after 2500 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, significantly outperforming the Sb anode. The phase transition mechanism uncovered in this work provides valuable insights for the rational design of advanced alloy&#8208;based anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>A Multimodal Ensemble Framework for Optimal Mutant Prediction and Computational Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present GEMS, a robust framework for enzyme engineering that leverages the ensemble zero&#8208;shot capabilities of multiple modalities. By integrating evolutionary, structural, and sequence&#8208;based constraints, GEMS effectively models the sequence&#8211;structure&#8211;function relationship and predicts beneficial variants.








Abstract
Exploring mutational landscape of proteins to engineer improved enzymes remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional methods, whether reliant on high&#8208;throughput experimentation, direct evolution, or on computational prediction, often face challenges to effectively model the complex epistatic and long&#8208;range interactions that related to protein function. To address this, we present GEMS, a robust framework for enzyme engineering that leverages the ensemble zero&#8208;shot capabilities of multiple modalities. By integrating evolutionary, structural, and sequence&#8208;based constraints, GEMS effectively models the sequence&#8211;structure&#8211;function relationship and predicts beneficial variants. Benchmarking against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art (SOTA) methods revealed that GEMS achieves competitive performance in ranking beneficial variants, generates highly informative initial variant libraries, highlighting its strength in capturing long&#8208;range functional constraints. We rigorously evaluated GEMS on five diverse enzyme engineering cases under both pure enzyme (Caulobacter segniscarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase from Marine gamma proteobacterium (MgpCSO), aldehyde dehydrogenase from Dickeya parazeae (DpADA)) and whole&#8208;cell conditions (CYP105A3 from Streptomyces carbophilus (P450 Sca&#8208;2), O&#8208;methyltransferase 1 from Cnidium monnieri (CmOMT1), prenyltransferase from Pastinaca sativa (PsPT2)). Our results demonstrate that GEMS successfully identifies activity&#8208;enhancing mutations, with single variants exhibiting 1.1 to 3.2&#8208;fold improvements in catalytic efficiency. Collectively, our findings prove GEMS as a powerful and versatile tool for advanced enzyme engineering.

         <title>Ferroelectric&#8208;Field&#8208;Steered SEI Engineering for Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actively tailor SEI chemistry by directing the electric field. Introducing ferroelectric MOF interlayers reshapes ion distribution in the electric double layer, promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, and ultimately delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability for lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The design and controllable regulation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) remain pivotal yet elusive for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Conventional strategies, dictated by thermodynamic nucleation sequences have limited ability to steer interfacial reactions. Here we introduce the electric&#8208;field vector as a geometric order parameter to actively reconfigure the interfacial double layer and in turn, the SEI chemistry. A ferroelectric metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) interlayer establishes a built&#8208;in reverse electric field that enriches anions at the Li surface, triggering their preferential reduction and constructing an inorganic&#8208;dominant (LiF/Li2O) SEI that effectively suppresses dendrite growth. Consequently, Li||Li symmetric cells cycle stably for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with&#160;&lt;&#160;20&#160;mV polarization, and LiFePO4 full cells maintain&#160;&gt;95% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C/5 C. This field&#8208;oriented strategy transcends traditional material screening, opening an additional dimension for electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven interface engineering toward safe and durable high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>Boosting Array&#8208;based Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections via a Heterobifunctional Bridge&#8208;Driven Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterobifunctional bridge strategy yields a dual&#8208;mode responsive array in which analytes trigger fluorescence turn&#8208;on via covalent competition or quenching via noncovalent aggregation. Integrated with machine learning, this sensing platform enables ultra&#8208;sensitive, 30&#160;min diagnosis of mono&#8208; and polymicrobial UTI clinical samples.








Abstract
Array&#8208;based sensing platforms have witnessed significant progress in recent years, demonstrating considerable potential for high&#8208;throughput and multiplexed analytes detection; however, their clinical translation remains hindered by inadequate sensitivity in complex biofluids. Herein, we introduce a heterobifunctional bridge&#8208;driven (HB&#8208;Bridge) strategy for constructing the sensor array, which incorporates asymmetric termini to enable dual&#8208;mode sensing through concurrent covalent binding and electrostatic interactions. Upon addition of bacteria or lipopolysaccharide analogues, the array constructed by covalently complexing HB&#8208;Bridge HB1&#8208;HB3 with perylene diimide fluorophores (PDIs) P1&#8208;P6 allow both fluorescence turn&#8208;on through covalent competition and quenching through noncovalent aggregation. The optimized array enabled the simultaneous identification of 21 uropathogens in urine, achieving 84.52% blind&#8208;test accuracy. Ultrasensitive detection was achieved for Escherichiacoli, the predominant cause of over 80% of clinical urinary tract infections (UTIs), with a limit of OD600&#160;=&#160;0.0000417. Notably, in a double&#8208;blind study of 150 clinical urine samples, the top&#8208;performing multilayer perceptron (MLP), screened via multiple machine&#8208;learning classifiers, achieved 98.50% accuracy in simultaneously distinguishing multiple bacterial types within 30 min using only 12.5 &#181;L of urine, and remarkably maintained 97.92% accuracy even in clinically challenging polymicrobial cases. Overall, this study establishes a dual&#8208;mode sensing platform enabling rapid and precise UTI diagnosis with strong potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Building Topological&#8208;Disordered High&#8208;Entropy Amorphous Oxides for Adaptive Compensation During Alternating CO2 Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose high entropy amorphous oxides (HEAOs) to combat electrochemical fatigue. Their disordered network can adaptively compensate during the cyclic process to suppress collapse. HEAOs achieved a discharge voltage of 3.14&#160;V and an energy efficiency of &#8764;90% in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. This mechanism involves charge redistribution inducing structural relaxation to improve fatigue resistance, providing a new strategy for robust electrode design.








Abstract
Material fatigue from alternating structural evolution degrades electrochemical performance through local collapse and deactivation, with the key challenge being preservation of active&#8208;site durability. To minimize structural deformation while sustaining reaction kinetics, topological disorder engineering offers a synergistic pathway integrating energy level mergence with high structural freedom. Here, we propose high&#8208;entropy amorphous oxides (HEAOs) as a model system featuring intrinsic self&#8208;adaptive topological disorder. Their dynamic metal&#8211;oxygen coordination network enables exceptional structural relaxation, where flexible M&#8211;O&#8211;M linkages and multicomponent integration cooperatively induce d&#8211;d electron transfer and/or d&#8211;p orbital coupling. These electronic interactions trigger localized charge redistribution for self&#8208;adaptive compensation under alternating electrochemical conditions such as CO2 reduction/evolution. In Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, HEAOs deliver an ultra&#8208;high discharge voltage of 3.14&#160;V after long&#8208;term cycling at 100&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining &#8764;90% energy efficiency across different current densities. Unlike conventional strategies emphasizing local structural tuning, this work shifts the focus to long&#8208;range integrity engineering to suppress electrochemical fatigue. The self&#8208;adaptive compensation of HEAOs arises from responsive topologically disordered metal&#8211;oxygen polyhedra, effectively mitigating strain accumulation and redefining long&#8208;range topological adaptability as a key design principle for fatigue&#8208;resistant electrochemical materials.

         <title>Strongly Electron&#8208;Accepting Lattice Oxygen of CeO2 for Highly Efficient Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strongly electron&#8208;accepting lattice oxygen drives a novel thermodynamically favorable dimethyl carbonate synthesis path via methanol self&#8208;carbonylation and lowers the energy barrier for CO2 and methanol to dimethyl carbonate by synergistically regulating reactant adsorption, overcoming long&#8208;standing thermodynamic and kinetic limitations.








Abstract
Converting CO2 and green methanol to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) has both theoretical and practical value in carbon neutrality and MeOH upgrading, but its efficiency is far from the application requirement due to the thermodynamic non&#8208;spontaneous process limitation and high kinetic barrier in CO2 and methoxy coupling. Herein, the strongly electron&#8208;accepting lattice oxygen was introduced onto CeO2 via a hydroxylation&#8208;induced Pt spontaneous redispersion strategy. The introduction of strongly electron&#8208;accepting lattice oxygen enabled the highly reactive *CO intermediate formation, which triggered a novel thermodynamically favorable *CH3O&#8211;*CO coupling to DMC synthesis. In addition, the lattice oxygen modification also markedly regulated the electron distribution of catalyst, thereby optimizing the adsorption strength of CO2 and methanol and thus reducing the entire reaction barrier of *CH3O&#8211;CO2 coupling to DMC via a rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step shifting. Benefiting from these advantages, Pt1/CeO2&#8211;SO sample achieved a DMC yield of 62.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#8212;six&#8208;fold higher than reported conventional catalyst under similar conditions.

     alt="Strongly Electron-Accepting Lattice Oxygen of CeO2 for Highly Efficient Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 and Methanol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongly electron-accepting lattice oxygen drives a novel thermodynamically favorable dimethyl carbonate synthesis path via methanol self-carbonylation and lowers the energy barrier for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methanol to dimethyl carbonate by synergistically regulating reactant adsorption, overcoming long-standing thermodynamic and kinetic limitations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and green methanol to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) has both theoretical and practical value in carbon neutrality and MeOH upgrading, but its efficiency is far from the application requirement due to the thermodynamic non-spontaneous process limitation and high kinetic barrier in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methoxy coupling. Herein, the strongly electron-accepting lattice oxygen was introduced onto CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via a hydroxylation-induced Pt spontaneous redispersion strategy. The introduction of strongly electron-accepting lattice oxygen enabled the highly reactive *CO intermediate formation, which triggered a novel thermodynamically favorable *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8211;*CO coupling to DMC synthesis. In addition, the lattice oxygen modification also markedly regulated the electron distribution of catalyst, thereby optimizing the adsorption strength of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methanol and thus reducing the entire reaction barrier of *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling to DMC via a rate-determining-step shifting. Benefiting from these advantages, Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;SO sample achieved a DMC yield of 62.1&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8212;six-fold higher than reported conventional catalyst under similar conditions. This work revealed the key role of strongly electron-accepting lattice oxygen in the innovative DMC synthesis pathway, with potential applications in developing more efficient synthetic routes for methanol upgrading and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Consistent Approach to One Coordinate Pnictide Moieties M&#8801;Pn&#8722; Using PnH2&#8722; Salts (M = Zr, Ti; Pn = P, As, Sb).</title>

         <dc:description>
One coordinate pnictide (Pn3&#8722; = P, As, and Sb) salts of TiIV and ZrIV were prepared using PnH2&#8722; as pnictogen atom transfer from suitable TiII and ZrIV complexes through H2 extrusion. This strategy allows access to unprecedented 3d and 4d terminal stibides, alongside phosphide and arsenide analogues, enabling systematic comparisons across the Pn group and M ion. Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational studies reveal maximum covalency in the TiAs and ZrAs bonding.








Abstract
Establishing a congruent approach to delivering a pnictide atom (Pn3&#8722; = P, As, and Sb) to transition metal ions is a challenge, especially for the heavier congeners As and Sb, and when varying the transition metal. We showcase here a convenient route to molecular forms of one coordinate stibide ligands bound to ZrIV and TiIV ions, represented by the discrete salts [K(L)][(PN)2M&#8801;Sb] (M&#160;=&#160;Zr (2), Ti (10); PN&#8722; = (N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2; L&#160;=&#160;2,2,2&#8208;Kryptofix or 18&#8208;C&#8208;6 crown&#8208;ether/2THF), which were prepared via H2 extrusion from [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)(THF)SbH2] added to the ZrIV cyclometallated&#8208;hydride, [(PN)(PN&#8217;)Zr(H)] (1), and the TiII precursor [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)][(PN)2TiCl] (8) respectively. This strategy was extended to the lighter congeners Pn&#160;=&#160;As, P using [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)(THF)AsH2] (M&#160;=&#160;Zr (3)), and NaPH2 (M&#160;=&#160;Ti (6)). Structural and computational studies were applied to understand the bonding trends in the pnictide series, and the role of the metal ion.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Shift&#8208;Engineered Pt Single&#8208;Atom/Cluster Synergy Boosts Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric COFs with identical topology but distinct nitrogen locations enable atomic&#8208;level control of metal&#8208;anchoring environments. Shifting N sites from node to linker reveals their impact on metal&#8208;support interactions and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Imine&#8208;linked COFs stabilize Pt2+/Pt0 dual sites with superior charge transfer, outperforming alkene&#8208;linked single&#8208;atom systems and establishing a general paradigm for active&#8208;site design.








Abstract
Achieving atomic&#8208;level precision in anchoring metal catalysts onto optimal support sites remains challenging due to surface heterogeneity, and the impact of local coordination on dispersion and photocatalysis is unclear. We address this by designing four isomeric COFs (imine/alkene&#8208;linked pairs) with identical topologies but distinct N&#8208;anchoring sites within hexagonal channels. For photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE), Pt anchored on imine&#8208;linked COFs exhibit superior activity compared to those on alkene&#8208;based COF. The optimal PHE rate of COF&#8208;I2&#8208;Pt reaches 26.72&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 which is 6.1&#8208;fold higher than alkene&#8208;linked counterpart. The apparent quantum efficiency of COF&#8208;I2&#8208;Pt reaches 12.1% at 420&#160;nm, representing one of the best performances reported among COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Multimodal characterization confirms imine COFs stabilize dual&#8208;active sites (Pt2+ species and metallic clusters), whereas alkene COFs predominantly host Pt single atoms. The imine system's superior activity arises from synergistic inter&#8208;site charge transfer between Pt clusters and isolated atoms, optimizing proton adsorption and reduction kinetics. Density functional theory calculations reveal the Pt adsorption energy on distinct nitrogen anchoring sites, the excited electron dispersion situation, and the underlying PHE mechanism. This work establishes constitutional isomerism as a platform to decouple anchoring site geometry from chemical composition, providing design principles for atomically precise photocatalyst supports.

         <title>Nonheme Fe Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Enantiodivergent Nitrogen Migration: Directed Evolution and Computational Study of Isopenicillin N Synthases for Biocatalytic Synthesis of Arylglycines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonheme Fe enzyme isopenicillin N synthase was reprogrammed and evolved as an efficient nitrogen migratase IPNSNim, converting diverse azanyl esters to valuable l&#8208;arylglycines with up to 16&#8201;000 TTN and 97:3 e.r. IPNSNim and ACCONim allowed enantiodivergent preparation of both l&#8208; and d&#8208;arylglycines. Mechanistic studies revealed a change in the rate&#8208;determining step and H atom transfer enantioselectivity for these nonheme enzymes.








Abstract
We describe the reprogramming and directed evolution of nonheme Fe enzyme isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) as an efficient biocatalyst for 1,3&#8208;nitrogen migration reactions via an unnatural mechanism. Directed evolution of isopenicillin N synthase from Emericella nidulans furnished a quadruple mutant (EniIPNS V185L I187V S102I R279H, IPNSNim), enabling the conversion of a range of azanyl esters into N&#8208;protected l&#8208;arylglycines. IPNSNim achieved a TTN of 16&#8201;000 and a TOF of 1200 min&#8722;1. This TTN surpassed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small&#8208;molecule Fe catalysts by 330&#8208;fold and represented the highest TTN value reported for a nonheme Fe enzyme in a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. IPNSNim and our previously evolved ACCONim (ACCO: 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid oxidase) exhibited complementary enantiopreference, allowing enantioselective synthesis of either l&#8208; or d&#8208;arylglycines&#8212;essential building blocks in clinically important peptide therapeutics. Mechanistic studies revealed a biocatalyst&#8208;controlled switch in the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS): While the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is the RDS for ACCONim&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen migration, it is likely not with IPNSNim. Moreover, while ACCONim exhibits almost no enantioselectivity in this HAT step, IPNSNim confers excellent enantiocontrol over HAT. Computational studies using density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that IPNS and ACCO adopt two different substrate binding modes. Classical MD simulations shed light on important interactions between the substrate and active&#8208;site residues that control the substrate binding mode and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Rationally Tailoring Simple Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors Toward Zwitterionic Interlayers for Organic Photovoltaics: The Effect of Synergetic Sidechains Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through synergistic engineering of polar zwitterionic and non&#8208;polar sidechains, simple non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) were converted into efficient cathode interlayers (zNFREAs). The optimized material exhibits exceptional thickness insensitivity, broad compatibility across various systems, enabling 20.73% efficiency organic solar cells with good operational stability.








Abstract
Advancing organic solar cells (OSCs) require simultaneous progress in organic semiconductors for both active layers and interlayers. The disparate electronic and structural properties of electron acceptors and interlayers present a significant challenge to optimal interfacial compatibility. Herein, we report four zwitterionic non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (zNFREAs) as interlayer materials, featuring a simple thiophene&#8211;benzene&#8211;thiophene core and 5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone terminals, affording low synthetic complexity and low&#8208;lying energy levels. Synergistic modulation of central polar and peripheral non&#8208;polar sidechains effectively tunes optoelectronic properties and molecular aggregation. TBT&#8208;TMZ, integrating central hexyl&#8208;pendant zwitterionic groups with peripheral 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl substituents, exhibits favorable solubility and work function tunability, a well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, as well as desirable active layer compatibility. PM6:Y6&#8208;based devices incorporating TBT&#8208;TMZ achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.21%, retaining approximately 90% of their peak PCE even with TBT&#8208;TMZ layers at a thickness of 101&#160;nm, demonstrating exceptional thickness insensitivity. Furthermore, TBT&#8208;TMZ displays broad compatibility with diverse active layers, delivering an outstanding PCE of 20.73% for the D18:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO blend. This work not only introduces an innovative class of zwitterionic materials based on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFREAs but also sheds light on the critical role of systematical polar and non&#8208;polar sidechains optimization toward high performance water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Emission and Chirality Transfer Based on Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry of a Motorized All&#8208;Benzene Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we design a series of motorized carbon nanohoops M[8]CPP, M[9]CPP, and M[11]CPP. Upon macrocyclization, these motors exhibit acceleration&#160;of rotary speed and further induce fluorescence quenching of the nanohoops. Notably, leveraging the host&#8211;guest interactions between M[11]CPP and guest molecules, photo&#8208;activated fluorescence emission and circularly polarized luminescence are realized.








Abstract
In this study, a series of motorized carbon nanohoops M[8]CPP, M[9]CPP and M[11]CPP are designed. Transient absorption (TA) spectra reveal these cyclic motors exhibit unprecedented acceleration of rotary speed upon incorporation into an all&#8208;benzene macrocyclic stator, which is attributed to ring strain induced decrease of the steric hindrance at the fjord region. Especially, M[8]CPP realizes 107&#8208;fold increase of the rotation speed compared with the noncyclic motor. Such high rotation speed leads to the fluorescence quenching of the motorized carbon nanohoops. Interestingly, M[11]CPP possesses a rigid macrocyclic cavity, which can bind with C60 and C70 in 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. The formation of host&#8211;guest complexes decelerates the photo&#8208;isomerization processes of M[11]CPP and achieves photo&#8208;activated fluorescence emission of the host&#8211;guest systems. Furthermore, taking advantage of the intrinsic chirality of M[11]CPP, as well as the CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between M[11]CPP and perylene, the chirality is transferred onto perylene, and circularly polarized luminescence is realized. This work not only provides a novel strategy for tuning the optical properties of cycloparaphenylenes through host&#8211;guest interactions but also demonstrates the potential of integrating molecular motors into macrocyclic systems to achieve dynamic control over molecular behavior.

         <title>Differential Adsorption on Synergistic Cu&#9472;Cd Sites Enables Direct Hydrogenation in Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Cu&#8211;Cd sites enable differentiated adsorption of *C and *H intermediates, promoting the proton&#8208;direct&#8208;coupling pathway for selective CO evolution in acidic CO2 reduction. The Cu&#8211;Cd catalyst delivers 98.6% Faradaic efficiency for CO in pH 1.2 electrolyte and sustains high energy efficiency in a PEM electrolyzer for &gt;250&#160;h.








Abstract
The direct involvement of proton in acidic CO2 reduction is key to boosting energy efficiency and preventing carbonate formation. However, the competitive adsorption of proton at low overpotential limits CO production by inhibiting the activation and hydrogenation of CO2 to form the key intermediates, *COOH. To address this challenge, we developed a Cu&#9472;Cd alloy catalyst, which optimizes the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway through a synergistic regulation between dual Cu and Cd active sites. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Cd incorporation enhances *CO2 adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation. By proving direct electrochemical hydrogenation, our catalyst achieved a remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.6% at&#160;&#8722;1.12&#160;V versus RHE, and operated for over 250&#160;h at a total current of 0.4&#160;A under a voltage of 2.55&#160;V in a proton exchange membrane electrode assembly. This research presents a powerful new insight for high&#8208;performance acidic CO2 electrolysis in proton&#8208;abundant electrolyte environments.

Methanethiosulfonate&#8208;based BODIPY dyes selectively react with thiols to form disulfides (Stick). When exposed to light, these BODIPY disulfides undergo a rearrangement that yields a stable sulfide bond (Glue). This &#8220;Stick and Glue&#8221; strategy combines precise thiol labeling with excellent conjugate stability for bioimaging applications.

         <dc:description>
Periodic ab initio nanoreactor molecular dynamics is used to agnostically investigate the reaction network of selective catalytic reduction converting nitrogen oxide via copper&#8208;exchanged chabazite zeolites. Autonomous reaction discovery revealed established as well as previously unreported pathways, including a water&#8208;assisted N2 formation and a novel radical&#8208;driven route to N2O. Free energy barriers were computed for the explored mechanism including phononic contributions. More in the Communication (e14074), Jan Meisner and co&#8208;workers.

In the Communication (e18517), Andr&#233; K. Eckhardt and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the advantageous properties of solid para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) matrices for electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy by investigating the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical and an in situ generated P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical. The spectral resolution of the P&#8208;centered radical in p&#8208;H2 is roughly enhanced by a factor of three compared to argon.

A biomimetic NO capture&#8208;activation&#8208;conversion strategy was firstly formulated by encapsulating N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) within a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) mimic&#8208;containing coordination capsule as reported by Liang Zhao and co&#8208;workers in the Communication (e19123). The platform echos the native S&#8208;nitrosoglutathione reductase and exhibits remarkable performance for NH3 electrosynthesis, expanding a new horizon for existing nitrogen conversion methodologies.

         <title>Exploring the World of Double Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
As two conjugated nanohoops covalently linked by a central unit, double nanohoops&#160;are a relatively new class of strained nanocarbons with different properties to single nanohoops. This review gives an overview of all reported double nanohoops, categorizing their structures, syntheses, and discussing properties and applications. Creativity and synthetic endurance can reward double nanohoops with attractive chiroptical and supramolecular properties.








Abstract
Conjugated nanohoops have become highly relevant compounds based on their unique conjugation, structural, optoelectronic, and morphological properties. Recent synthetic efforts have progressed to access more elaborate structures, incorporating two conjugated nanohoops covalently linked by a central linking unit, so&#8208;called double nanohoops. Double nanohoops broaden the molecular diversity of strained nanocarbons, and they can show properties exceeding those of single nanohoops. They are often inherently chiral and attractive candidates as chiral&#8208;polarized&#8208;light emitters, and with two cavities are interesting supramolecular hosts. We herein provide an overview of double nanohoops reported to date, with loops built from only oligo(paraphenylene) units. We categorize their structures into phenylene&#8208;linked double nanohoops, double nanohoops with X&#8208;linkers, zig&#8208;zag double nanohoops, lemniscular double nanohoops, and &#8220;other&#8221; double nanohoops. We identify four main synthetic pathways that are typically employed, making use of kinked precursors to oligo(paraphenylenes). We individually discuss properties and applications of each double nanohoop. This review shows that creativity and synthetic endurance can furnish unique double nanohoop structures with attractive chiroptical as well as supramolecular properties.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Tolerogenic Vaccines: Next&#8208;Generation Strategies for Autoimmune and Allergic Disease Therapies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticle&#8208;based tolerogenic vaccines harness controlled antigen delivery and immunomodulation to establish tolerance in autoimmunity and allergy. This review outlines how nanoparticle design (size, shape, composition, administration route) influences biodistribution and immune&#8208;cell targeting. We highlight preclinical and clinical progress, translational challenges, and future directions including biomaterial innovation and tolerance&#8208;guiding adjuvants.








Abstract
The concurrent rise of autoimmune diseases, which affect nearly 10% of the global population, along with&#160;allergic conditions such as asthma, food allergy, and atopic disease, together pose substantial health and economic burdens. Traditional therapies rely on systemic immunosuppression that temporarily mitigates symptoms but often compromises protective immunity, increases infection and malignancy risk, and fails to restore central or peripheral tolerance. These limitations underscore the need for antigen&#8208;specific strategies capable of re&#8208;establishing durable immune balance. Tolerogenic vaccines have emerged as a promising solution by retraining the immune system to restore antigen&#8208;specific tolerance while preserving normal host defense, though challenges remain in efficiently targeting antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), avoiding their overactivation, and minimizing off&#8208;target effects. Nanoparticles provide a versatile platform to address these hurdles, as their size, composition, and surface modifications can be tailored to direct biodistribution, enhance antigen delivery, and modulate immune signaling. By co&#8208;delivering antigens and immunomodulators in programmable ways, nanoparticles offer a pathway to overcome key translational barriers and achieve precise immune reprogramming. This review explores how advances in nanomedicine are being applied to tolerogenic vaccines, focusing on three areas: (1) current nanoparticle platforms, (2) the role of biomaterial selection, and (3) multifunctional engineering strategies, while also considering the clinical outlook and translational challenges of bringing these therapies from bench to bedside.

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Regulation for Directly Solar Energy Conversion in Zinc&#8208;Air Battery with 4.55% PCE</title>

An atomic&#8208;level bandgap&#8208;engineering modulation method based on nitrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (N&#8208;GDYs) was reported for application in photo&#8208;coupled rechargeable batteries. Bandgap modulation created tailored electronic structures of N&#8208;GDYs, enhancing the separation and migration ability of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Bandgap matching triggered the system to exhibit enhanced light utilization.








Abstract
Direct conversion of solar energy in zinc&#8208;air batteries (SZABs) represents a promising direction for energy storage with huge market potential. However, the key issue to be overcome is the pronounced photo&#8208;generated carrier recombination and a mismatch in optoelectronic&#8208;catalytic properties. Here, we report an atomic&#8208; level bandgap&#8208;engineering regulation method to unlock high&#8208;efficiency solar energy harvesting and catalytic activation in SZABs based on nitrogen&#8208;substituting graphdiyne (N&#8208;GDYs). The bandgap&#8208;regulation creates tailored electronic structures of N&#8208;GDYs, which not only extends the light absorption range, but also enhances the ability of separation and migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Interestingly, the 2N&#8208;GDY demonstrates superior photocatalytic performance, due to its optimal matching bandgap structure. The resulting SZABs device employing 2N&#8208;GDY achieves exceptional battery efficiency of 96.8% under visible light illumination, accompanied by a remarkably low voltage gap of 0.04&#160;V. Notably, under monochromatic light excitation, the system demonstrates enhanced light utilization through wavelength&#8208;selective absorption, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 4.55%. This work fundamentally advances the rational design of 2D catalytic materials, offering a critical pathway toward high&#8208;efficiency solar rechargeable energy systems that bridge the gap between sustainable energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>Plasmonic Hot&#8208;Carrier Redox Enables Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer at C&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic hot carriers provide unprecedented control over coupled electron&#8211;proton transfer, enabling visible&#8208;light activation of strong C&#9472;H bonds. Using an energy&#8208;filter electrode, we reveal a stepwise electron&#8208;then&#8208;proton pathway and directly tune the underlying driving forces. This work positions plasmonic nanostructures as a powerful new platform for uncovering fundamental reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) enables the activation of strong X&#9472;H bonds (X&#160;=&#160;C, N, O) under mild conditions, yet mechanistic interrogation remains challenging due to limited control over electron and proton energetics. Here, we demonstrate that plasmon&#8208;driven photocatalysis provides a powerful platform to disentangle these contributions. Using gold nanoparticles supported on an engineered energy&#8208;filter substrate as photoelectrodes, we achieve oxidative C&#9472;H bond activation in 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide via multi&#8208;site PCET under visible&#8208;light excitation. Photocurrent kinetics and energetics zone analysis reveal an electron&#8208;then&#8208;proton transfer (ET&#8211;PT) pathway that requires pre&#8208;association of the base. The average plasmonic oxidation potential is estimated at &#8764;0.64&#160;V versus Fc&#8314;/Fc, corresponding to hot&#8208;hole energies of &#8764;0.52&#160;eV. These findings establish plasmonic materials not only as versatile light absorbers for photoredox catalysis but also as mechanistic probes for resolving fundamental PCET pathways.

         <title>Singlet Fission in Push&#8211;Pull Para&#8208;Azaquinodimethane Films under the Gaze of Time Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
New push&#8211;pull para&#8208;azaquinodimethane derivatives were synthetized through a sustainable protocol. Transient absorption results showed ultrafast intermolecular singlet fission (SF) in film and demonstrated for AsOMe higher triplet energy than for literature SF materials, with intriguing perspectives for photovoltaics toward silicon matched SF. The high&#8208;spin quintet observed via time resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance appears to be a viable molecular spin qudit for quantum information science applications.








Abstract
In this study, a totally green synthetic protocol was employed to obtain four new donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor para&#8208;azaquinodimethane (pAQM) derivatives to uncover the effect of tuning the push&#8211;pull character on their photobehaviour in solution as well as in thin film and in particular on their capability of undergoing singlet fission (SF). The bisthiophene and substituted benzene were used as electron&#8208;donor groups at opposite sides of the pAQM electron&#8208;acceptor core in asymmetric structures (AsOMe and AsNMe2), whereas different 5&#8208;phenyl thiophene moieties were symmetrically linked to the pAQM core in TPh and TPhOMe. The photoinduced excited state dynamics was investigated in a synergic effort by employing both time resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies, with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Our femtosecond transient absorption results showed that intermolecular SF is enabled in the solid state aggregates of these compounds: the fastest and most efficient SF was revealed for the structure with the strongest push&#8211;pull degree (AsNMe2). The other asymmetric molecule (AsOMe) interestingly exhibited higher energetic SF&#8208;generated triplet excitons (1.3&#160;eV) than literature SF&#8208;materials, as demonstrated by the nanosecond transient absorption sensitization experiments, with possible intriguing implications toward silicon matched SF photovoltaics. Time resolved EPR measurements unveiled the spectral signature of the quintet multiexciton intermediate 5(TT) in the pAQM thin films for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, for such unconventional SF materials. The high&#8208;spin photoinduced 5(TT) appears to be a promising candidate for Quantum Information Science and technologies as a viable molecular spin qudit.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agent Based on a Confinement&#8208;Activated Fluorescent System in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;symmetric molecular barrel, LSMB, was used to get enhanced emission via confinement&#8208;induced structural rigidification of the TPH guest in water. This emissive host&#8211;guest system displayed efficient antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, specifically higher against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains than Gram&#8208;positive, even in dark conditions, collectively via membrane depolarization, membrane rupture, and intracellular ROS generation mechanism.








Abstract
The influence of host&#8211;guest interactions on the physical behavior of encapsulated species represents a compelling area of study. Research in this domain has predominantly centered on how these interactions affect catalytic activity and the photoluminescence properties of confined guest molecules. In contrast, their potential impact on antibacterial and antibiofilm activity has been rare. In this report, we present antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of a Pd8 low&#8208;symmetric molecular barrel (LSMB) based host&#8211;guest system (TPH&#8834;LSMB) in water. The new low&#8208;symmetric ligand (L) upon self&#8208;assembly with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor generated a tetrafacial low&#8208;symmetrical barrel (LSMB). Encapsulation of a guest TPH [1,4&#8208;bis(2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)benzene], which is otherwise non&#8208;emissive in dilute solution, by LSMB resulted in a remarkable increase in its emission intensity even in very dilute aqueous conditions. The host&#8211;guest complex (TPH&#8834;LSMB) shows better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity compared to the host (LSMB). More interestingly, TPH&#8834;LSMB shows better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains as compared to Gram&#8208;positive strains. This selectivity against Gram&#8208;negative strains provides a critical advancement in the rational design of supramolecular antibacterial and antibiofilm agents. The findings provide valuable insights for the development of next&#8208;generation, light&#8208;independent therapeutic systems specifically tailored to overcome the inherent challenges posed by Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

         <title>Unlocking the Continuous Flow Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins Through the Development of a Non&#8208;Deactivating Immobilized Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed stable, robust, and reusable heterogeneous metal catalysts for an efficient continuous flow asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of a variety of olefins, far beyond the typical benchmark AH. The products are produced continuously over long periods of time with high catalytic performance (up to 99% ee). A practical procedure for storage and reuse of the catalysts after flow AH ensures their availability for extended periods of time.








Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) is a leading method for producing enantiopure compounds and several industrial processes rely on its chemical efficiency. However, these processes involve noble metals and even sophisticated ligands that are costlier than the metal itself. The recovery of these expensive catalysts remains an unsolved issue. Despite efforts to develop supported catalysts for continuous&#8208;flow AH, none have been used industrially, as most suffer depletion of selectivity and/or activity (from catalyst deactivation or metal leaching), and its heterogenization often lengthens the catalyst's synthetic route. Here, we report a simple synthetic approach to air stable, Ir&#8208;P,S catalysts covalently immobilized onto polystyrene resins, without increasing the number of synthetic steps. The Ir&#8208;loaded functional resin fully retains the catalytic performance of the homogeneous Ir&#8208;complex. Remarkably, they were successfully applied to the continuous&#8208;flow AH of olefins, far beyond the typical benchmark substrates. The products are continuously produced over long periods of time with high yields and selectivities, with low residence time, even at pressures far below to the corresponding batch reaction. No deactivation or leaching of Ir is observed, and a practical simple procedure for storage and reuse of the immobilized catalysts after flow hydrogenation secures their immediate availability for extended periods of time.

         <title>Designing Nuclease&#8208;Resistant Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Assemblies of Oligonucleotides Through Supramolecular Conjugation with Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional hierarchical supramolecular assembly was formed between nucleotides and a platinum(II) complex through a salt&#8208;bridge interaction. These superstructures, called &#8220;nucleozymes&#8221;, exhibited photoresponsive oxidase&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like function, enabling on&#8208;demand switching of the activity, and showed resistance to nucleases with unaltered catalytic activity.








Abstract
The utility of oligonucleotides has evolved beyond merely delivering genetic information to playing a transformative role in functional nanotechnology. Specifically, the enzyme&#8208;like properties of catalytic oligonucleotides, including ribozyme, DNAzyme, and their mimics, offer unique opportunities in bioengineering. A primary challenge in leveraging these catalytic oligonucleotide structures in biomedical applications is their susceptibility to degradation by nucleases. Herein, we introduce a high&#8208;affinity (107&#160;M&#8722;1) salt&#8208;bridge interaction&#8208;mediated generalized noncovalent fabrication strategy to construct arrays of oligonucleotide&#8208;templated metal complexes, producing catalytically active hierarchical assemblies displaying resistance to nucleases in human serum. The one&#8208;dimensional isodesmic polymeric growth of the supramolecular structures between oligonucleotides and guanidinium containing Pt(II)&#8208;complex generates Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions imparting luminescence enhancement (8&#8211;10 fold) with long&#8208;lived (&#8764;30&#160;ns) excited states. Consequently, light&#8208;mediated singlet oxygen generation enables efficient catalytic oxidation of substrates. Notably, the catalytic activity exclusively resembles oxidases, which function in the absence of H2O2 (an essential component of peroxidases), unlike conventional nucleotide&#8208;based enzyme mimics. The assembly showcases light&#8208;dependent anticancer activity in vitro, with excellent biocompatibility. Overall, the ease of production and robustness of functional oligonucleotide&#8208;based higher&#8208;order materials, coupled with on&#8208;demand photoactivation of exclusive oxidase enzyme&#8208;like activity, makes the new supramolecular platform a promising candidate for practical biomedical applications.

         <title>Engineering Isoquinoline&#8208;derived Directing Template for Distal C5&#8722;H Functionalization of Bicyclic Aza&#8208;arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategically engineered isoquinoline&#8208;based catalytic directing template enables highly selective distal benzocyclic C5&#9472;H activation of bicyclic aza&#8208;arenes. This design unlocks diverse C5 alkenylation and unprecedented alkynylation, establishing a robust platform for remote C&#9472;H functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant benzoazines. Mechanistic studies, supported by X&#8208;ray and spectroscopic evidence for possible intermediates, clarify the pathway.








Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused mono&#8208; and di&#8208;azines constitute privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals and functional materials; however, achieving site&#8208;selective remote benzocyclic C&#9472;H functionalization on these motifs remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of an ideal tethering site for directing group (DG) and the tendency of heteroatom to deactivate metal catalysts. Herein, we report a robust isoquinoline&#8208;based directing template that enables catalytic, site&#8208;selective C5&#9472;H functionalization of benzo&#8208;fused azines. The template recruits the substrate through reversible N&#8208;coordination, allowing the strong &#963;&#8208;donating isoquinolinyl arm to position the metal catalyst for precise activation of the remote C5&#9472;H bond. This design facilitates efficient alkenylation with a broad range of alkenes, which are otherwise inaccessible with conventional stoichiometric nitrile&#8208;based templates reported in the literature. Notably, this new class of directing template unlocks the unprecedented C5&#9472;H alkynylation, further demonstrating the pivotal role of structural tuning of the directing entity in facilitating diverse C5&#9472;H functionalization transformations. Various key intermediates have been intercepted by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and complementary spectroscopic analyses to shed light on the mechanism of the catalytic cycle. The mechanistic study also discloses that the cooperativity exists between the directing template (DT) and the template chaperone (TC) in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Twist and Shine: The Impact of Halogen Substitution on Thiele Hydrocarbon's Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogenation in Thiele hydrocarbons strongly influences structure and excited&#8208;state dynamics. Depending on substitution, &#8220;boat&#8221; folded forms show large Stokes shifts and strong solvatochromism, while planar &#8220;butterfly&#8221; derivatives exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence yields. Halogen substitution thus enables precise tuning of charge separation and responsiveness in functional materials.








Abstract
In this work, two new mixed&#8208;halide Thiele hydrocarbons were synthesized and characterized to elucidate the influence of halogenation patterns on their photophysical properties, addressing the role exerted by steric constraints and electronic effects. Interestingly, their interplay governed a unique spectroscopic behavior that is driven by pronounced geometric rearrangements upon photoexcitation. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed that derivatives with limited diradical character, and correspondingly shorter exocyclic C&#9552;C bonds, are likely to adopt a folded boat&#8208;like conformation in the ground state, a structural motif not previously observed in Thiele hydrocarbons. Upon photo&#8208;excitation, these exocyclic bonds were subject to a significant elongation, facilitating mixing between the bright singly excited (SE) state and the dark, doubly excited (DE) state. These interactions enabled the formation of a zwitterionic excited state, a finding that is consistent with recent observations for halogenated derivatives. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed this mechanism, which provides a promising strategy for designing fluorophores with exceptionally large Stokes shifts (more than 2&#160;eV) and tailored photophysical and electronic properties. In addition, a pronounced mechanofluorochromic response has been observed for the first time in the case of folded derivative, opening the way to the use of these species as multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular materials.

         <title>A Precisely Bromo&#8208;Functionalized [9]Cycloparaphenylene as a Platform for Late&#8208;Stage Multisite &#960;&#8208;Extension Toward Chiral Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely synthesized hexabrominated [9]cycloparaphenylene (CPP), accessed by a gold&#8208;mediated method, enables efficient multisite post&#8208;functionalization through cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Late&#8208;stage &#960;&#8208;extension on the CPP framework successfully affords armchair&#8208;type chiral nanohoops exhibiting strong circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| = 0.100).








Abstract
Selective functionalization of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) has remained a significant synthetic challenge due to their inherent ring strain. In this study, we present the synthesis of a [9]CPP derivative in which bromo groups are orderly introduced at the 2,5&#8208;positions of three benzene rings in the [9]CPP framework, each separated by two phenylene units. The use of our developed Au&#8208;mediated CPP synthetic method enabled efficient and scalable access to the target compound in five steps with an overall yield of 37%. The resulting molecule exhibited phosphorescence at low temperature, arising from the heavy&#8208;atom effect of the bromo substituents. Furthermore, post&#8208;functionalization through Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions demonstrated multisite &#960;&#8208;extension and afforded a chiral nanohoop exhibiting exceptional chiroptical performance (|glum| = 0.100).

&lt;p&gt;Precisely synthesized hexabrominated [9]cycloparaphenylene (CPP), accessed by a gold-mediated method, enables efficient multisite post-functionalization through cross-coupling reactions. Late-stage &#960;-extension on the CPP framework successfully affords armchair-type chiral nanohoops exhibiting strong circularly polarized luminescence (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Suppressing Alkyl Ammonium Deprotonation with Low&#8208;pKa Solvent for Reproduceable and Stable High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;pKa hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was introduced as solvent to replace isopropanol (IPA) for passivators. HFIP possesses a weaker proton&#8208;donating ability rather than proton&#8208;acceptation ability compared to IPA, reducing the possibility of deprotonation of ammonium salts (R&#8208;NH3+) to amines (R&#8208;NH2). Finally, the perovskite solar cell with HFIP/PDAI treatment achieved an efficiency of 26.91% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability








Abstract
Various passivation strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the chemical stability of passivators has received limited attention. This study investigates replacing conventional isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent for depositing passivation layers on perovskite films, offering a novel approach to minimizing defects and improving photovoltaic performance. The unique properties of HFIP, particularly its low pKa and strong proton&#8208;donating ability, effectively inhibit the deprotonation of organic ammonia salts. As a result, the HFIP&#8208;based passivation solution exhibits enhanced chemical stability, leading to highly reproducible PSCs fabrication. Additionally, perovskite films treated with the HFIP passivation solution demonstrate higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity and longer carrier lifetimes. Consequently, PSCs treated with HFIP&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dihydroiodide (PDAI) solution achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.91% (certified PCE of 26.88%) and maintained 95.9% of their initial efficiency under operational conditions for 1000 h.

         <title>Controllable C&#9472;N Coupling Toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis via Spin State Modulation on Fe Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;doped Fe3O4 catalyst achieved a high urea FE and a yield rate at low potential, via co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 with NO3&#8722;. Cu doping altered Fe eg electron densities, thereby optimizing *NO2 coverage. Further spin state regulation by *NO2 adsorption promoted CO2 activation and increased *CO coverage, and the C&#9472;N coupling proceeded via the *CO&#160;+&#160;*NO2&#8594;*CONO2 pathway.








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) presents a promising and sustainable method for urea synthesis. However, it remains challenging to modulate the intermediates reactivity and C&#9472;N coupling at the matchable stages. Here, we propose a strategy to regulate the C&#9472;N coupling mode on Fe site via spin state modulation. Both experimental and theoretical calculations revealed that the Cu2+&#8208;doped Fe3O4 promoted C&#9472;N coupling at the early stage via the *CO&#160;+&#160;*NO2&#8594;*CONO2 pathway, enhancing the catalytic performance significantly. The catalysts could achieve a urea Faradaic efficiency of 47.3% and a yield rate of 635.9&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at low overpotential, along with exceptional stability over 30&#160;h, representing one of the highest performances reported to date. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrated that Cu doping lowered the eg electron density of Fe and enhanced *NO2 adsorption. The adsorbed *NO2 in turn further decreased Fe spin state through &#960; backdonation, which facilitated CO2 activation and increased *CO coverage. Moreover, optimizing the *NO2 coverage also reduced the energy barrier for *CO&#160;+&#160;*NO2&#8594;*CONO2, and inhibited *NO2 protonation, leading to high selectivity toward urea.

         <title>Unimolecular Micellization Strategy for Achieving NIR&#8208;II Excited Fluorophores with Enhanced Brightness in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unimolecular micellization strategy is developed to construct NIR&#8208;II&#8211;excited molecular fluorophores with enhanced brightness and stability in aqueous solution. The amphiphilic fluorophore IR&#8208;FCT8CP forms unimolecular micelles that create a dense hydrophobic armor, effectively suppressing water&#8208;induced quenching and enabling high&#8208;contrast in vivo vascular imaging under 1064 nm excitation.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) enables deep&#8208;tissue visualization with high spatial&#8211;temporal resolution. Developing molecular fluorophores with high brightness and stability in aqueous media is therefore critical. However, most NIR&#8208;II excited fluorophores suffer from pronounced nonradiative decay and fluorescence quenching in water. Here, we propose a unimolecular micellization strategy to construct high&#8208;brightness NIR&#8208;II fluorophores that self&#8208;assemble into stable unimolecular micelles (UIMs) in aqueous solution. The designed star&#8208;shaped amphiphilic molecule IR&#8208;FCT8CP carries long alkyl chains that collapse into a compact hydrophobic core upon micellization, effectively shielding the fluorophore from water&#8208;induced quenching and restricting intermolecular interactions. The resulting IR&#8208;FCT8CP UIMs exhibit absorption and emission maxima at 979 and 1181&#160;nm, respectively, with a quantum yield of 0.05% and a molar absorption coefficient of 1.67&#160;&#215;&#160;104 M&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;1 in aqueous solution, yielding higher brightness than IR&#8208;FCDP and IR&#8208;FCTP UIMs. The IR&#8208;FCT8CP UIMs enable dynamic in vivo vascular imaging under 1064&#160;nm excitation using a 1500&#160;nm long&#8208;pass filter, clearly resolving vascular networks with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. This unimolecular micellization strategy offers a general design concept for developing stable, high&#8208;brightness NIR&#8208;II molecular fluorophores for efficient bioimaging in physiological environments.

         <dc:description>
A directed nucleation strategy enables the atomic&#8208;level synthesis of PtRuMoNiCoFe high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanocatalysts with controllable dimensionality and facet exposure. The (111)&#8208;facet&#8208;enriched HEA nanowires, characterized by abundant step edges, undercoordinated atoms, and defect&#8208;induced lattice distortions, facilitate electronic redistribution and lower reaction energy barriers, resulting in exceptional electrocatalytic activity and excellent cycling stability in zinc&#8208;air batteries.

Precisely engineering crystallographic facets and dimensional architectures at the atomic scale is critical for unleashing the catalytic efficiency of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanomaterials; however, the inherent complexity and atomic disorder of HEAs present significant synthetic challenges. Herein, we introduce&#160;an innovative&#160;directed crystallization strategy that integrates structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs) and coordination solvents to kinetically steer precursor reduction pathways, enabling the synthesis of PtRuMoNiCoFe HEA nanocatalysts with tailored morphology dimensionality (0D&#8208;2D) and selectively exposed crystal facets. The (111)&#8208;facet&#8208;rich HEA nanowires (HEA@NWs) possess strain&#8208;engineered lattices with atomic step edges, undercoordinated sites, and defect&#8208;induced distortions that collectively promote localized electronic redistribution, thereby enhancing active&#8208;site density and accelerating interfacial electron transfer. Theoretical calculations reveal that (111) facet exposure elevates the d&#8208;band center, optimizing intermediate adsorption/desorption and significantly lowering the redox energy barrier. Consequently, the HEA@NWs exhibit an ultra&#8208;low redox overpotential gap (&#916;E) of 0.68&#160;V. As cathode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, the HEA@NWs deliver a high specific capacity of 797.8 mAh gZn&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 650 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, substantially outperforming benchmark commercial catalysts (Pt/C&#160;+&#160;RuO2, 350 h). This work establishes an advanced synthetic paradigm for facet&#8208;specific atomic&#8208;level design in HEA catalysts, underscoring their substantial potential for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Thiosulfonate&#8208;Derived BODIPY &#8220;Stick and Glue&#8221; Strategy for Fluorescent Thiol Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a powerful photochemical strategy for converting disulfide bonds into stable thioether linkages via a [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. By integrating this reaction into traditional methanethiosulfonate&#8208;based thiol labeling, we enable light&#8208;triggered stabilization of peptide and protein conjugates with enhanced robustness and versatility.








Abstract
Fluorescent thiol labeling is a powerful technique for investigating peptide and protein functions, interactions, and cellular localization, offering minimal structural disruption due to the low natural abundance of cysteine residues. The high nucleophilicity of cysteine thiol groups further facilitates efficient and selective labeling. However, existing thiol&#8208;labeling strategies, most commonly involving iodoacetamides, maleimides, or methanethiosulfonates (MTS), often suffer from limited selectivity, undesirable side reactions, and the instability of the resulting conjugates. To overcome these limitations, we developed three spectrally orthogonal MTS&#8208;derived fluorescent labeling agents based on coumarin and BODIPY photoremovable protecting groups and a BODIPY thiosulfate water&#8208;soluble analogue. Using conventional MTS chemistry, these agents form disulfide&#8208;linked conjugates with thiols, which are subsequently converted into stable thioethers upon light&#8208;induced sulfur extrusion. This two&#8208;step approach significantly improves the stability of labeled conjugates, providing a robust and permanent method for fluorescent labeling of small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Our findings offer a promising strategy for precise fluorescent labeling in biological applications.

         <title>Binding Energy&#8208;Assisted Oxidation Potential as a Measure of Prelithiation Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;ion desolvation was proved the rate&#8208;determining step of the solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation, while the solution structures affect the capability of prelithiation in the electrode material. The impacts of the structures of the solute and solvent in the lithium&#8208;aromatic compound complex solution (LACS) were clarified on the binding energy (BE) and the oxidation potential (EO) of the solution. We proposed to apply the BE&#8208;assisted EO as a measure of prelithiation capability of LACS.








Abstract
The solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation of electrode materials is an effective approach to elevate the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and energy&#8208;density of the Li&#8208;ion battery. Although various lithium&#8208;aromatic compound complex solutions (LACSs) have been reported as prelithiation reagents, fundamental understandings are still lacking regarding their drastic difference in prelithiation behavior. In this work, the rate&#8208;determining step and some key factors that affect the prelithiation capability were recognized via electrochemical evaluation, spectroscopic analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Considering the inherent correlations between the potential of electrochemical Li+&#8208;extraction from LACS upon cyclic voltammetry (the oxidation potential of LACS, EO), the calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, the binding energy (BE) of the solvated Li&#8208;ions to the solution (BEsolution), and the prediction accuracy of prelithiation capability and calculations efficiency, we proposed BE&#8208;assisted EO as a descriptor for its prelithiation feasibility. This strategy will provide important guidance for the rapid selection and rational design of LACSs for efficient chemical prelithiation.

         <title>Chiral Gadolinium Halides with Narrow Ultraviolet B Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral gadolinium halides with efficient circularly polarized luminescence in the ultraviolet B (UVB) region were constructed by coupling the 4f&#160;&#8722;&#160;4f transitions of Gd3+ with chirality. They exhibit high photoluminescent quantum yield, narrow bandwidth and high luminescent dissymmetry factor at 312&#160;nm. The fabricated circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes based on these chiral gadolinium halides also exhibit efficient UVB&#8208;CPL.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the ultraviolet B (UVB) region holds great potential applications in asymmetric catalysis, enantioselective polymerization, and polarization&#8208;based optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption. However, to date, the CPL materials in the UVB region remain unexplored. In this study, the first chiral gadolinium&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides, (R/S&#8208;C3H7NF3)3GdCl6 (R/S&#8208;3F&#8208;Gd), were constructed, which exhibit efficient CPL in the UVB region. Owing to the unique 4f&#8208;4f transition of Gd3+ ions, R/S&#8208;3F&#8208;Gd shows a high photoluminescent quantum yield of 18%, a narrow full width at half maximum (&#8764;3&#160;nm) and a ultralong photoluminescence lifetime (&#8764;6.6&#160;ms). Additionally, their CPL can be further tuned by applying the external magnetic field. Then the light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) chips coated with R&#8208; or S&#8208;3F&#8208;Gd were also fabricated, which exhibit high dissymmetry factor of&#160;+&#160;9.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;8.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, further demonstrate their potential as circularly polarized light source in the UVB region. Our work offers a novel strategy for designing the chiral luminescent materials with efficient CPL response in the UVB region and broadens the family of chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth halides.

         <title>Semiconducting Borophene Realized via Hydrogenation&#8208;Driven Structural Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>

Theoretical predictions identify a stable semiconducting semi&#8208;hydrogenated &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4 with hydrogenation&#8208;induced structural reconstruction. Guided by this theory, we synthesized &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4, validated by structural characterization, spectral measurement, and first&#8208;principles simulations. Additionally, this phase exhibits good air and chemical stability. This combined theory&#8211;experiment study identifies an air&#8208;stable semiconducting borophene phase for nanoelectroic and ooptoelectric applications.








Abstract
Hydrogenation provides a robust approach to both dramatically improve borophene's ambient stability and induce semiconducting behavior&#8212;two essential requirements for its integration into nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the vast configurational diversity of hydrogen adsorption patterns impedes the identification of a definitive semiconducting hydrogenated borophene phase. In this work, we conducted systematic high&#8208;throughput searches to investigate various hydrogen coverages on &#945;&#8242;&#8211;borophene and determined that semi&#8208;hydrogenated configurations constitute the most promising semiconducting candidates. Guided by these predictions, we synthesized semi&#8208;hydrogenated borophene, &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4 via chemical vapor deposition. Subsequent extensive structural characterization and complementary computational simulations provided compelling evidence for the formation of this stable semiconducting phase. In sharp contrast to the previously proposed &#945;&#8242;&#8211;4H model, the synthesized &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4 undergoes hydrogenation&#8208;induced structural reconstruction&#8212;stabilized by both two&#8208;center&#8211;two&#8208;electron B&#8211;H and three&#8208;center&#8211;two&#8208;electron B&#9472;H&#9472;B bonds&#8212;whose ensuing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling drives strong hybridization between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane p orbitals, thereby opening a band gap. This combined theoretical and experimental study identifies an air&#8208;stable semiconducting borophene and paves the way for borophenes as next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Apoptosis&#8208;Amplified Intracellular Paclitaxel Nanoparticle Formation Enhances Microtubule Aggregation and PANoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the therapeutic outcome of paclitaxel, we herein propose a strategy of intracellular apoptosis&#8208;amplified paclitaxel nanoparticle formation by rationally designing a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;paclitaxel conjugate Ac&#8208;DEVDC(StBu)K(PTX)&#8208;CBT, which could be specifically activated in cancer cells to assemble into paclitaxel nanoparticles to aggregate microtubules, creating an apoptosis amplification loop for enhancing tumor PANoptosis.








Abstract
The clinical efficacy of paclitaxel is limited by systemic toxicity at high doses and poor cellular uptake of nanoformulations. Intracellular paclitaxel nanostructure formation is a promising strategy, yet further enhancing its anticancer effect remains challenging. Herein, we propose a strategy of intracellular apoptosis&#8208;amplified paclitaxel nanoparticle formation by rationally designing a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;paclitaxel conjugate Ac&#8208;Asp&#8208;Glu&#8208;Val&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(paclitaxel)&#8208;CBT (Ac&#8208;DEVDC(StBu)K(PTX)&#8208;CBT). Upon intracellular glutathione reduction and caspase&#8208;3 cleavage, Ac&#8208;DEVDC(StBu)K(PTX)&#8208;CBT undergoes a CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction and subsequent self&#8208;assembly into paclitaxel nanoparticles. These nanoparticles aggregate microtubules and promote apoptosis, thereby activating more caspase&#8208;3 to drive further nanoparticle formation, creating an amplification loop for enhancing therapeutic outcome. In vitro, Ac&#8208;DEVDC(StBu)K(PTX)&#8208;CBT remarkably inhibited cell cycle, downregulated phosphorylated YAP&#8208;1 level by &#8764;48%, and induced ZBP&#8208;1/AIM2&#8208;based PANoptosis. Furthermore, in orthotopic tumor models, Ac&#8208;DEVDC(StBu)K(PTX)&#8208;CBT significantly increased caspase&#8208;3 expression compared to free paclitaxel treatment and markedly prolonged survival via cytoskeleton disruption. This strategy holds high promise for enhanced tumor treatment in the clinic.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction via Ligand&#8208;Engineered Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Co sites in bithiazole&#8208;based COF (Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF) enable efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO (16.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 96% selectivity) through enhanced charge transfer and lowered energy barriers versus bipyridine analogue, demonstrating ligand&#8208;engineered secondary&#8208;sphere effect.








Abstract
The microenvironment of single&#8208;atom active sites plays a pivotal role in determining the activity and selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we report a highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst, Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF, featuring Co(II)&#8208;bithiazole N motifs that achieve exceptional CO2 photoreduction performance (16.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 96% selectivity) under visible light irradiation in the presence of&#160;a photosensitizer and a sacrificial agent. Through isoreticular design maintaining identical Co&#8208;N2O2 primary coordination, Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF exhibits 2.8&#8208;fold higher activity than its bipyridine analogue Co&#8208;Bpy&#8208;COF with Co(II)&#8208;bipyridine N motifs (5.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Systematic characterization reveals the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole ligand significantly enhances charge transfer efficiency and reduces the activation energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation (0.79&#160;eV versus 1.14&#160;eV). Bader charge analysis demonstrates stronger electron donation from Co sites to CO2 (0.63 e for Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF versus 0.58 e for Co&#8208;Bpy&#8208;COF), facilitating CO2 activation. This work demonstrates a ligand&#8208;engineering strategy for precisely tuning the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom active sites to achieve efficient CO2 conversion.

Abstract
Asymmetric photomediated iron catalysis remains underdeveloped; up to now, only limited successful examples have been reported. Herein, we describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective deoxygenative addition of propargyl, allyl, and benzyl alcohols to cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;ketiminoesters mediated by visible light, providing straightforward access to a diverse array of chiral cyclic sulfonamides. This approach addresses several synthetic limitations in entioselective transformation of cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;ketiminoesters, including the limited development of general and efficient asymmetric propargylation methods, and the limited structural diversity in allylation products. The synthetic versatility of this method is demonstrated through the preparation of a number of valuable intermediates. Preliminary density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the radical addition pathway suggest that the observed enantioselectivity primarily arises from steric interactions between the incoming radical and the 4&#8208;chlorophenyl ring on the chiral ligand.

         <title>Brominated Pd&#8208;on&#8208;Au Nanostructures Enable Reductive Relay Isomerization of Alkynes to E&#8208;alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a brominated Pd&#8208;on&#8208;Au nanostructures that enables efficient semi&#8208;reduction of alkynes to trans&#8208;alkenes via a multi&#8208;site relay mechanism using formic acid as hydrogen source. The TiO2&#8211;Au interfaces selectively activate FA and facilitate alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Spatially adjacent Au&#8208;Pd1 sites drive Z&#8594;E isomerization, while bromine&#8208;modified Pdn clusters precisely modulate FA dissociation kinetics and suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Achieving stereoselective alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation to E&#8208;alkenes remains a persistent challenge due to inherent limitations of conventional catalysts in controlling stereochemistry and suppressing over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we resolve this fundamental dilemma through a rationally designed brominated Pd&#8208;on&#8208;Au nanocatalyst (Pd0.03&#8208;Br1^Au/TiO2) featuring spatially segregated active sites operating via reductive relay isomerization. This sophisticated architecture enables unprecedentedly efficient E&#8208;alkene synthesis (&gt;96% selectivity for trans&#8208;stilbene at near&#8208;quantitative conversion). Fabricated by sequentially depositing Au nanoparticles on TiO2, with tiny Pd loading on Au, and controlled surface bromination, the catalyst leverages synergistic cooperativity: The TiO2&#8211;Au interface primarily activates formic acid (FA) to generate reactive surface&#8208;bound hydride species (H*) while minimizing unproductive H2 formation; concurrently, atomically dispersed Pd1 sites on Au nanoparticles exclusively mediate rapid Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization, whereas bromide&#8208;capped Pd nanoclusters kinetically regulate FA dissociation kinetics at TiO2&#8211;Au interface and sterically block overhydrogenation adsorption geometries. This spatially orchestrated multisite system decisively overcomes classical activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;offs, establishing a universally applicable framework for decoupling and optimizing individual catalytic functions in heterogeneous design. Our work delivers both a sustainable strategy for scalable trans&#8208;alkene production and fundamental mechanistic insights into complex cooperative reaction networks.

         <title>Backbone Asymmetry Modification in Amphipathic Conjugated Polymers Enables Record n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>

We report two n&#8208;type amphipathic conjugated polymers, via backbone modification to enhance charge transport. Upon sequential doping with N&#8209;DMBI, Pg5DPP&#8209;TBZ achieves an electrical conductivity of 145.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.5&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a record power factor (PF) of 385&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#8212;surpassing previous n&#8209;type organic thermoelectrics and rivaling leading p&#8209;type materials. Combined with a low thermal conductivity of 0.37&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, a ZT value of 0.30&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02 is realized, demonstrating outstanding overall thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) has lagged behind p&#8208;type counterparts due to limited electrical conductivity and power factor (PF). Here, we report two n&#8208;type amphipathic conjugated polymers,&#160;Pg5DPP&#8208;BBTz&#160;and&#160;Pg5DPP&#8208;TBZ, based on glycolated thiophene&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole units, engineered via backbone modification to enhance charge transport. Replacing a symmetric sp2&#8208;sulfur atom in&#160;Pg5DPP&#8208;BBTz&#160;with an sp2&#8208;nitrogen atom yields the asymmetric&#160;Pg5DPP&#8208;TBZ, which exhibits stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, a more favorable density of states distribution, and extended charge delocalization. When sequentially doped with N&#8208;DMBI,&#160;Pg5DPP&#8208;TBZ&#160;achieves an electrical conductivity of&#160;145.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.5&#160;S cm&#8722;1&#160;and a record&#8208;high PF of&#160;385&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;&#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2&#8212;surpassing previous n&#8208;type OTEs and rivalling top p&#8208;type materials. This performance stems from high charge mobility, large delocalization, and mitigated carrier&#8208;carrier repulsion. Combined with a low thermal conductivity (0.37&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), a ZT of&#160;0.30&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02&#160;is realized. Our work demonstrates that subtle backbone modification in amphipathic polymers is a powerful strategy to advance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.

         <title>Enhanced Resolution in EPR Spectroscopy Using para&#8208;Hydrogen Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the advantageous properties of solid para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) matrices for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by investigating the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical and an in situ generated P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical. The spectral resolution of the P&#8208;centered radical in p&#8208;H2 is roughly enhanced by a factor of three compared to argon.








Abstract
We developed a matrix isolation experiment utilizing a closed&#8208;cycle helium cryostat, which operates at 2.5&#160;K and enables electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements in solid para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) matrices. The EPR spectra of the persistent 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical and an in situ generated P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical were recorded at 2.5&#160;K in p&#8208;H2. The spectrum of TEMPO in p&#8208;H2 shows a narrower linewidth compared to argon, and its matrix&#8208;isolated spectrum and simulation are reported. The P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical was generated in p&#8208;H2 via in situ photolysis of the corresponding phosphorus iodide, which affords roughly a three&#8208;fold increase in spectral resolution compared to argon, as well as higher sensitivity due to the non&#8208;existing cage effect in soft p&#8208;H2.

         <title>Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Tube Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of dynamic metal&#8208;organic tube isomers was prepared from a ligand with multiple coordination modes and flexible conformations. They can not only undergo multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive and multi&#8208;level transformations, including conformational isomerization driven by physical factors, adaptive deformations driven by neutral guests, adaptive reconstructions induced by anionic templates, but also can be used to stabilize guest radicals and optimize guest luminescence.








Abstract
Preparing artificial assemblies that can achieve multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive and multi&#8208;level transformations remains a huge challenge. Here, a pair of dynamic metal&#8208;organic tube isomers was prepared from a ligand with multiple coordination modes and flexible conformations. They can undergo multi&#8208;level transformations in response to different types of stimuli, including conformational isomerization driven by physical factors (e.g., concentration, temperature, and polarity), adaptive deformations driven by neutral guests, adaptive reconstructions induced by anionic templates. Notably, the guest&#8208;driven deformed tubes can continue to undergo reconstruction induced by the PF6&#8722; template, and DMSO can simultaneously serve as a physical factor and a chemical template to continuously regulate isomerization and reconstruction of the dynamic tube. The dynamic tube can be used to regulate the stacking modes of encapsulated 1&#8208;formylpyrene and 1&#8208;acetylpyrene through adaptive deformations, thereby generating stable guest radicals, enhancing guest fluorescence and achieving white light emission.

They can undergo multi-level transformations in response to different types of stimuli, including conformational isomerization driven by physical factors (e.g., concentration, temperature, and polarity), adaptive deformations driven by neutral guests, adaptive reconstructions induced by anionic templates. Notably, the guest-driven deformed tubes can continue to undergo reconstruction induced by the PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; template, and DMSO can simultaneously serve as a physical factor and a chemical template to continuously regulate isomerization and reconstruction of the dynamic tube. The dynamic tube can be used to regulate the stacking modes of encapsulated 1-formylpyrene and 1-acetylpyrene through adaptive deformations, thereby generating stable guest radicals, enhancing guest fluorescence and achieving white light emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localization of Photothermal Effect Enables Impetus Transition from Heating to Solar Energy for Liquid&#8208;Phase Reaction with Superior Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ concentration of photothermal energy in active layer via encapsulation architecture enables the impetus transition from bulk heating to solar energy for liquid&#8208;phase reaction, attaining productivity up to 57.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol with light as the only driving force.








Abstract
Thermally driven reactions are fundamental but energy&#8208;intensive for chemical production. Solar&#8208;induced photothermal effect is anticipated to thoroughly substitute bulk heating as sustainable power for liquid&#8208;phase reactions, but this impetus transition has not been achieved due to the undesired dissipation of photothermal energy to solvent. Here, we propose a novel photothermal catalyst architecture (ZrCP/CNT) by coating photothermal core with low&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity active layer that serves as both catalytic center and heat insulation fence to enable photothermal catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Owing to the leveraging of solar energy, ZrCP/CNT delivers specific productivity of 57.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts regardless of reaction conditions. The superior performance is attributed to the localized high&#8208;temperature gradient resulted from the in situ concentration of photothermal energy in active layer. The strategy also works for other aldehydes and variational illumination. These findings will guide general photothermal system design for extensive liquid&#8208;phase reactions.

         <title>Amorphization Strategy to Circumvent the Oxo Wall for Generating Active Co(IV)&#9552;O Species in Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an amorphization strategy for TiO2 support to circumvent the oxo wall limitation, enabling selective generation of active Co(IV)&#9552;O species. Mechanistic studies revealed amorphous TiO2 endows Co&#8208;O4 tetrahedral structure and high&#8208;spin state, enhancing Co 3d&#8208;O 2p interactions for PMS activation. The trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal&#8208;like Co(IV)&#9552;O configuration mitigates antibonding orbital occupation of terminal M&#9472;O bond, effectively bypassing the oxo wall constraint.








Abstract
High&#8208;valent Co(IV)&#9552;O species have garnered significant attention as a promising non&#8208;radical reactive species. However, their selective generation encounters substantial challenges due to the oxo wall rule that emphasizes intrinsic instability of the terminal metal&#8211;oxygen (M&#9472;O) bond. Here, we propose an amorphization strategy for TiO2 support to circumvent the limitation of oxo wall, favoring the formation of high&#8208;valent Co(IV)&#9552;O species. The advantages of Co(IV)&#9552;O species in terms of oxidative activity, durability, and environmental tolerance were investigated by Fenton&#8208;like catalysis. Mechanistic studies revealed that amorphous TiO2 endowed Co single atoms with a Co&#8208;O4 tetrahedral structure and a high&#8208;spin state of 3d electron, leading to strong Co 3d&#8208;O 2p interactions that promote peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Notably, the produced Co(IV)&#9552;O species adopted a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal&#8208;like configuration, which mitigated the electron occupation in the antibonding orbitals of terminal M&#9472;O bond, thus bypassing the oxo wall. This work enhances the understanding of the mechanism underlying heterogeneous Co(IV)&#9552;O formation and broadens strategies for preparing efficient catalysts for critical oxidation reactions.

         <title>Open&#8208;Air, Ultrafast Photoiniferter Polymerization Enables 3D Printing with Low&#8208;Viscosity Resins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast photoiniferter polymerization tolerant to ambient air enables photo&#8208;curing 3D printing at 8 s/layer, yielding well&#8208;defined polymers with no additives.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;curing 3D printing is fundamentally challenged by the formation of heterogeneous networks with uneven cross&#8208;linking densities and unreacted monomer residues, which compromise the integrity and performance of printed parts. While photo&#8208;controlled radical polymerization (photo&#8208;RDRP) offers a path to precise network control, it is often limited by sluggish kinetics, necessitating viscous resins to compensate for slow curing rates. To overcome this, we employed a computer&#8208;guided strategy to design a new photoiniferter, dithioindazolylcarboxylate (DTI). Computational analyses predicted DTI would be an efficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoiniferter. Under 415 nm light (10 mW cm&#8722;2), DTI enabled the photoiniferter polymerization of methyl acrylate with an apparent propagation rate (kpapp$k_\mathrm{p}^\mathrm{app}$) of 0.809 min&#8722;1, over four&#8208;fold higher than that of the existing dithiopyrazolylcarboxylate (DTP) with a kpapp$k_\mathrm{p}^\mathrm{app}$ of 0.196 min&#8722;1 in equivalent conditions under 425 nm (optimum for kpapp$k_\mathrm{p}^\mathrm{app}$). This was achieved while maintaining low molecular weight dispersity (&#272;&#160;&lt; 1.1). DTI also exhibited better oxygen tolerance, maintaining 65.9% of its kpapp$k_\mathrm{p}^\mathrm{app}$ (with respect to that under nitrogen) under an air&#8208;purging condition (1 mL 30 s&#8722;1), as compared to 13.3% for DTP under the same condition. This enabled ultrafast digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing at just 8 s per layer using routine low&#8208;viscosity acrylic resins, producing high&#8208;resolution, complex centimeter&#8208;scale prototypes. The technology also enabled photo&#8208;curing of anticorrosion coatings with an adhesion strength of 13.53 MPa and 720&#160;h resistance to acetic acid salt&#160;spray.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Redispersion of Platinum Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature dispersion phenomenon of Pt/CeO2 under NO was observed via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Theoretical calculations indicate that NO stabilizes low&#8208;coordination Pt species (Pt1O2&#8208;NO) with high surface mobility, facilitating efficient redispersion.








Abstract
Sintering is one of the major causes of catalyst deactivation, which requires redispersion to restore catalytic activity. However, conventional redispersion methods often require harsh high&#8208;temperature conditions or introduce contaminants, both of which can degrade catalyst integrity and limit their practical applicability. Here, a novel redispersion method that achieves highly dispersed Pt/CeO2 via NO treatment at an exceptionally low temperature of 200&#160;&#176;C, is visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confirmed by density functional theory (DFT). Interestingly, NO, although a milder oxidant compared to O2, promotes more effective Pt redispersion on the CeO2(100) surface. This behavior is governed by the kinetic behaviors of the Pt species formed under different oxidative atmospheres. Under NO, two&#8208;coordinated Pt atoms are formed, each bonded to two surface oxygen atoms. These species exhibit high mobility across the surface, enabling efficient redispersion at low temperatures. In contrast, exposure to O2 leads to the formation of four&#8208;coordinated Pt atoms bonded to four surface oxygen atoms, which significantly restricts surface diffusion and inhibits redispersion under the same temperatures. This ultralow&#8208;temperature redispersion mechanism is not limited to Pt/CeO2, but can also be extended to other catalyst systems, offering an energy&#8208;efficient and halogen&#8208;free alternative to conventional redispersion techniques.

This ultralow-temperature redispersion mechanism is not limited to Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but can also be extended to other catalyst systems, offering an energy-efficient and halogen-free alternative to conventional redispersion techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potential&#8208;Tailored Aryl&#8211;Sodium Reagent with Moderate Ionic Binding Strength Enables Precise yet Fast Hard Carbon Presodiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new aryl&#8208;sodium agents to achieve fast yet precise presodiation of hard carbon is essential for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, we propose a solution to the above challenge by tuning the potential and the aryl&#8208;sodium binding strength, and establish a dual descriptor for presodiation agent design. Phenanthrene&#8211;sodium, with moderate binding energy and a matched redox potential, enables &#8764;100% initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and stable cycling.








Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but coal&#8208;derived HCs often exhibit low reversible capacity and poor initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to irreversible sodium (Na) loss on defective carbons. Presodiation can directly improve ICE, but the imprecise and slow process can lead to under&#8208; or oversodiation and the formation of thick and unstable byproducts. Here, we propose a high precision and fast presodiation by aryl&#8208;sodium (Ar&#8211;Na) compounds dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with controlled potential and Ar&#8211;Na binding energy. Based on the thermodynamic driving force (redox potential) and ionic transfer kinetics (Ar&#8211;Na binding strength), a dual&#8208;descriptor design principle for presodiation agent is established. Phenanthrene&#8211;sodium (Ph&#8211;Na) with a moderate ionic binding energy of&#160;&#8722;&#160;0.92&#160;eV and a matched redox potential of 0.24&#160;V versus Na&#8314;/Na enables &#8764;100% ICE within 60 s and facilitates the formation of an ultrathin inorganic&#8208;rich SEI in the battery that enhances interfacial kinetics and cycling stability. The presodiated HC delivers a reversible capacity of 308.9 mAh g&#8722;1, and paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode exhibits 94.8% ICE, 99.2 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity, and 82.6% capacity retention after 350 cycles, demonstrating a scalable presodiation strategy for practical SIBs.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks with Mobile Cross&#8208;linking Points</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobile cross&#8208;linking points enable consecutive energy dissipation and accelerate dynamic bond exchange, thereby enhancing mechanical performance while lowering the reprocessing temperature to overcome key challenges of covalent adaptable networks.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have garnered increasing attention for their potential in sustainable materials. However, their material properties remain limited by interrelated challenges, particularly the need to ensure ease of processing while maintaining excellent mechanical performance. Herein, we report a class of polyrotaxane&#8208;based CANs (PRCANs) in which an axle containing dynamic boronic ester bonds is mechanically interlocked with two polymer chains, forming mobile dynamic cross&#8208;linking points. The mobile dynamic covalent bond cross&#8208;linking points simultaneously improve the mechanical performance of CANs while reducing the processing temperature. Under applied force, sliding occurs at both ends of the cross&#8208;linking points, creating an efficient pathway for energy dissipation. The representative PRCAN exhibits enhanced mechanical performance, showing twice the elongation at break (1160&#160;% versus 570&#160;%) and tensile strength (11.0&#160;versus 4.6&#160;MPa), and over four times the toughness (43.7&#160;versus 10.1 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) relative to the control with fixed dynamic covalent bond cross&#8208;linking points. At high temperatures, the mobility of the cross&#8208;linking points enhances the reaction probability for dynamic covalent bonds, thereby effectively reducing the processing temperature of CANs. The representative PRCAN can be processed at 110&#160;&#176;C for 10&#160;min, whereas the control sample requires 140&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min to reach a comparable reprocessing level.

         <title>Geneticability of Live&#8208;Cell Site&#8208;Specific Synthesis of Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel genetically programmable strategy is developed for in&#8208;situ synthesis of functional quantum dots (QDs) in live mammalian cells with designed protein&#8208;tag&#8208;level spatial precision. This approach enables the site&#8208;specific integration of desired functional inorganic nanomaterials at target protein molecules, even including delicate viral internal components such as nucleoproteins.








Abstract
Molecular&#8208;scale integration of non&#8208;natural functional components into living systems for precise manipulation, monitoring, and enhancement of organisms remains a great challenge. Here, we achieved the geneticable synthesis of functional inorganic nanomaterials with molecular&#8208;level spatial precision within live mammalian cells. By genetically encoding a cysteine&#8208;rich protein tag named 1DFS, and tuning its intracellular inherent metabolic pathways, organic molecules can be precisely synergized with inorganic molecules at a specific site of the protein of interest within live cells to grow a single inorganic semiconductor nanocrystal&#8208;specifically quantum dot (QD). This, in turn, endows the protein with unique fluorescent functions for precise and stable protein labeling even after multiple cell passages. This approach is flexible and universal, and QD can not only integrate into the specific protein in live cells but also synchronously grow on the delicate viral nucleoprotein (NP) during the natural replication and assembly of virions in the host cells. The labeled NPs then accurately assemble into viral ribonucleoproteins deep inside virions, resulting in fluorescent virions with full infectivity that exceeds capabilities of conventional genetic manipulation. This work provides a programmable platform for geneticable growth of inorganic nanomaterials at specific molecular sites, opening a new frontier in precise inorganic&#8208;enabled synthetic biology.

         <title>Dipoles Effect in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalyst by High&#8208;Energy p Orbitals for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the atom with the same number of valence electrons as N, this work designs a dipole structure, which has a &#8220;strong near and weak far&#8221; distribution characteristic, enabling more precise regulation of the electron distribution while minimizing the interference from carbon&#8208;based materials. This dipole structure significantly improves the performance of the Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts, allowing catalysts to reach the thermodynamic limit potential peak.








Abstract
Tailoring the coordination sphere of the metal atoms represents a highly promising strategy to modulate Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts. However, modifications in the first coordination shell often led to reduced catalyst stability, while those in the second shell exhibit limited efficacy in enhancing catalytic activity. In this work, we introduce N&#8208;group elements to engineer N&#8208;XVA dipoles, leveraging their characteristic &#8220;high density near the source but sparse at a distance&#8221; electric field to modulate the 3d orbitals of Fe. The introduction of N&#8208;XVA dipoles enhances the polarization of Fe single atoms, especially, with the increase of the periods, Fe 3d orbitals rearrangement occurs, resulting in an optimized binding energy for OH* intermediates that approaches the peak of the volcano plot. The resulting FeN4&#8208;Sb/C catalyst exhibits a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.833&#160;V and a degradation of only 18&#160;mV after 30,000 cycles accelerated durability testing, superior to commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, PEMFCs assembled with the FeN4&#8208;Sb/C catalyst deliver impressive performance (H2&#8211;O2: 1.1&#160;W cm&#8722;2; H2&#8208;air: 0.6&#160;W cm&#8722;2), outperforming nearly all recently reported single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts. This work not only reveals the periodic trend of dipole&#8208;modulated ORR activity in Fe single atom catalysts, but also demonstrates its potential for application in PEMFCs.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Allylic Heteroaromatic Amines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Amination of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amination enables direct coupling of heteroaryl amines with alkenes to deliver linear allylic heteroaryl amines. This method solves the challenge of catalyst deactivation caused by excessive metal coordination with heteroaryl amines, offers broad substrate scope, and provides a practical route for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.








Abstract
Heteroaryl amines are prone to over coordination in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin oxidation reaction system, which hinders the smooth catalytic reaction. Herein, we report a general method for the direct C&#9472;N coupling between inactive olefins and primary and secondary heterocyclic aromatic amines under palladium catalysis, which is an important transition that has not yet been revealed. By employing commercially available palladium catalysts, quinone oxidants, and inexpensive monodentate phosphine ligands, the oxidative amination of diverse heteroaryl amines proceeds smoothly, delivering a broad range of allyl heteroaryl amines with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, this strategy enables the late&#8208;stage modification of challenging biologically relevant molecules such as adenine and adenosine, further highlighting the practicality and synthetic utility of this reaction.

         <title>Single MOF Based on Asymmetric Intramolecular Electron Compartments Enables Highly Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Overall Reaction to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric &#8220;intramolecular electron compartments&#8221; (IEC) strategy enables single&#8208;component MOF catalyst efficiently drive the photocatalytic CO2 overall reaction (PCOR) toward multi&#8208;electron products, which breaks the traditional cognition that single&#8208;component MOFs are usually prone to produce low&#8208;electron products. This work not only demonstrates MOF as a feasible platform to produce multielectron products, but also offers a general design guidance for highly efficient PCOR catalysts.








Abstract
The development of single&#8208;component photocatalysts that can achieve highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 overall reactions (PCOR) to generate multielectron products remains a crucial challenge. Here, we present, for the first time, a novel strategy of constructing asymmetric &#8220;intramolecular electron compartments&#8221; (IEC) in single metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that enables efficient PCOR to multielectron products. The resulting Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NK1(BF4&#8722;) achieves a remarkable CH3OH production rate of 115.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (92.0% selectivity) without using any sacrificial agents and cocatalysts, making it one of the top&#8208;performing single&#8208;component PCOR catalysts reported to date. Notably, under simulating flue gas condition (15% CO2), it remains the remarkable performance of 110.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with corresponding total electron assumption rate of 661.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, the highest value reported to date, setting a benchmark for low&#8208;concentration CO2 photocatalysts in overall reaction. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal new insights that the presence of asymmetric IEC within MOFs accounts for the enhanced accumulation of photogenerated electrons, thereby promoting the production of multielectron products. Our work not only develops a promising photocatalyst for converting CO2 and H2O to methanol, but also establishes a universal design principle for constructing single&#8208;component PCOR catalysts that enable multielectron reduction products.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Diastereoselective Dearomative Dialkylation of Indoles with Two Different Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed dearomative dialkylation of indoles with two distinct alkyl halides via three component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling under mild conditions. The catalytic protocol offers a route for the modular assembly of diverse carbon quaternary center&#8208;containing dialkylated indoline derivatives with a broad substrate scope, great functional group tolerance and high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.








Abstract
The catalytic dearomative dicarbofunctionalization of indoles constitutes one of the most efficient ways to access poly&#8208;substituted indolines that are prevalent in many natural products and drugs. However, despite significant advances, three component dearomative dicarbofunctionalization of indoles has remained elusive. Herein, we report an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed dearomative dialkylation of indoles with two different alkyl halides via three component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling under mild conditions with the construction of two vicinal C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds at C2 and C3 sites. The catalytic protocol offers an efficient and straightforward route for the modular assembly of diverse carbon quaternary center&#8208;containing dialkylated indoline derivatives with a broad substrate scope (75 examples), excellent functional group tolerance and high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies, combining a series of experiments and DFT calculations, reveal that the catalytic reaction proceeds via a radical pathway.

A stereospecific, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free SN2 alkylation of cyanohydrins with chiral non&#8208;racemic secondary tosylates is reported, providing efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary ketones.

Abstract
A novel stereospecific, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkylation of cyanohydrins with enantiomerically enriched secondary tosylates is described. This method enables the general, efficient, and operationally simple synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary ketones by leveraging the nucleophilicity of cyanohydrin anions, which serve as umpolung carbonyl equivalents to facilitate highly stereospecific SN2 substitutions. Reactions involving alkenyl cyanohydrins proceed through a stereoconvergent olefin synthesis (SCOS) from a geometric E/Z mixture, furnishing stereochemically defined, conjugated &#945;&#8208;tertiary ketones. This methodology exhibits broad functional group tolerance, accommodating unactivated and sterically hindered acyclic and cyclic secondary tosylates. The resulting chiral ketones are configurationally stable and can be readily converted into synthetically versatile intermediates using classical transformations. The utility of this approach is exemplified by a concise, stereospecific synthesis of (R)&#8208;cyclamen aldehyde, underscoring its potential to streamline the preparation of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary ketones&#8212;structural motifs that feature prominently in both natural and non&#8208;natural products and serve as key intermediates in target&#8208;directed synthesis.

Here we developed a series network membrane with ordered pore structures via interfacial polymerization, using nucleophilic substitution reactions between POCs and diverse secondary&#8208;amine monomers. These membranes showed high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in separating APIs and GTIs within 100&#8211;350&#160;g mol&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) membranes play a crucial role in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The synthesis process of APIs typically contains low molecular weight genotoxic impurities (GTIs) that compromise product quality. However, current OSN membranes face significant technical challenges in separating high&#8208;value APIs with molecular weights (MW) below 350&#160;g mol&#8722;1 due to their lack of precisely controlled pore structures. Porous organic cages (POCs), a class of discrete organic molecules with permanent three&#8208;dimensional cavities, feature ordered pore structures, good processability and modularity, making them ideal candidates for fabricating membranes with highly tunable pore structures for precise separations. Here, we report the fabrication of porous network membranes via nucleophilic substitution reactions of POCs. These membranes, with retaining incorporated cavities, exhibit high methanol permeance and excellent dye rejection (&gt;94% for APIs with MW above 368&#160;g mol&#8722;1), outperforming commercial OSN membranes. Importantly, they achieve a selectivity of 13 in removing GTIs from APIs, thereby producing high&#8208;purity APIs. This work highlights the great potential of the POCs&#8208;based membranes for precision pharmaceutical separations.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Selective Temperature&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Thiophene Derivatives at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition of a dithiophene derivative on Ag(111) at room temperature followed by annealing gives rise to molecular wires, whereas the adsorption of the same precursor on a hot substrate affords the formation of benzotrithiophene species.








Abstract
The temperature&#8208;controlled transformation of organic molecules at interfaces is an incipient yet powerful strategy for tailoring their structural and physico&#8208;chemical properties. In this study, we investigate the substrate&#8208; and thermal&#8208;selective reactions of bis(3,4&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fused)tetrabromo&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinodimethane molecule (1), focusing on its behavior at distinct coinage metal interfaces, namely Au(111) and Ag(111). Combining scanning probe microscopy and theory, we demonstrate that its sequential transformations are highly dependent on the substrate material and the specific reaction temperatures. When a benzodithiophene precursor, endowed with&#160;=&#160;CBr2 units, is deposited under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions on both substrates held at room temperature (RT), or annealed to 100&#160;&#176;C in the case of Au(111), a self&#8208;assembly is formed comprising 1D covalent polymers achieved through debromination and homocoupling, which are aligned in a parallel fashion thanks to supramolecular interactions, giving rise to a 2D supramolecular polymer. However, when the substrate is held at or above 175&#160;&#176;C during deposition, the molecular precursors (1) undergo substrate&#8208;specific intramolecular reactions. On Au(111), a major transformation into pentalenodithiophene species is observed, concomitant with the formation of benzotrithiophene. On Ag(111), instead, pentalenodithiophene species are precluded. These findings highlight the importance of substrate selection and temperature control in enabling precise molecular transformations at the nanoscale.

         <title>Formal [4+3] Bridged Cyclization of Pyridines/Isoquinolines with Vinylcarbenes via Dearomatized Oxazinopyridine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal [4+3] bridged cyclization of pyridines/isoquinolines with vinylcarbenes through traceless oxazino azaarene intermediate has been developed, enabling efficient access to previously unexplored bridged azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonatrienes and their benzofused derivatives with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. Integrated mechanistic studies and computational analyses revealed two distinct cyclization pathways for the reaction of oxazino pyridine/isoquinoline intermediates with vinylcarbenes.








Abstract
The direct dearomative cycloaddition of pyridines provides a powerful tool to construct medicinally important azabicyclic scaffolds. However, existing methods are limited to accessing isoquinuclidine (2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cores. Here, we present a formal [4+3] bridged cyclization of pyridines/isoquinolines with vinylcarbenes, enabled by a dearomatization&#8208;cycloaddition strategy through a traceless oxazino azaarene intermediate. This method facilitates the efficient construction of previously unexplored bridged azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonatrienes and their benzofused derivatives with high efficiency and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective control. Furthermore, downstream conversions of the bridgehead imino group enable the synthesis of diverse bridged azabicyclic and heterotricyclic frameworks. Integrated mechanistic studies and computational analyses revealed two distinct cyclization mechanisms for the reaction of oxazino pyridine/isoquinoline intermediates with vinylcarbenes, providing insights into the origins of observed regioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Incorporation of Quantum Defects into Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Arylazo Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photochemical strategy to create complex aromatic quantum defects in carbon nanotubes using arylazo sulfonates. It provides access to brighter carbon nanotubes without purification and simpler biofunctionalization.








Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) consist of a carbon monolayer and fluoresce in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR, 800&#8211;2500 nm) region. Introduction of sp3 quantum defects (QDs) creates novel NIR emission features, which promise huge potential for (bio)photonics. However, so far defect chemistry based on diazonium salts is mainly limited to benzene derivatives. The reaction side products also quench SWCNT fluorescence and impair additional surface chemistry. Here, we introduce a photochemical strategy based on arylazo sulfonates to a) create more complex aromatic QDs and b) avoid side products that adsorb and quench. We show that this way coumarin and other QDs are incorporated, which increases overall NIR emission by more than 90% without purification. These materials can be non&#8208;covalently modified with biocompatible polymers (polyethyleneglycoles, DNA) without a change in photophysical properties and we demonstrate mechanical (viscosity) and chemical (neurotransmitter dopamine) sensing. This one&#8208;pot approach creates QDs in SWCNTs and provides access to advanced hybrid materials for photonic applications.

         <title>Concurrently Maximize CO2RR and Minimize HER: A Dual Catalytic Active Site Approach for Ampere&#8208;Level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;active&#8208;site electrocatalyst consisting of uncoordinated Ni&#8208;N3 and Cr&#8208;N2 moieties with Ni&#8208;Cr atomic pairs distance of &#8764;2.7&#160;&#197; enables efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. The in situ characterizations corroborate that Ni&#8208;N3 moiety promotes CO2 activation and unsaturated Cr&#8208;N2 moiety accelerates H2O dissociation. Both thermodynamic and kinetic simulations results verify more favourable dual&#8208;active&#8208;site mechanism.








Abstract
The practical application of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds a great promise but is hindered by low CO2 solubility. Under CO2 mass transfer limitations, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is promoted, resulting in a decrease in CO2RR Faradaic efficiency. Before CO2 supply reaches its maximum capacity, in neutral or alkaline conditions, increasing CO2RR selectivity requires additional hydrogen source from solvent H2O dissociation for CO2 protonation. However, it is challenging to concurrently achieve CO2 reduction and H2O dissociation at single active site. Herein, we synthesized a neighboring Ni&#8208;Cr atomic pair configuration with distance of &#8764;2.7&#160;&#197;. COMSOL Multiphysics finite&#8208;element studies demonstrate that appropriate distance between dual active sites should be on the order of a few angstroms. Operando XAS and soft NEXAFS characterizations indicate that the Ni&#8208;N3 promotes CO2 activation and Cr&#8208;N2 accelerates H2O dissociation. Theoretical investigations unveil the thermodynamic and kinetic superiorities of dual&#8208;active&#8208;site mechanism. Ni&#8208;N3/Cr&#8208;N2 exhibits higher FECO than Ni&#8208;N3, whereas Cr&#8208;N4 displays a strong preference for HER. The zero&#8208;gap MEA attains J of up to &#8722;1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a FECO exceeding 85% at a cell voltage of &#8722;4.0&#160;V, and maintains stable operation for over 100&#160;h at a J of &#8722;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

The in situ characterizations corroborate that Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moiety promotes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and unsaturated Cr-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moiety accelerates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation. Both thermodynamic and kinetic simulations results verify more favourable dual-active-site mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) holds a great promise but is hindered by low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solubility. Under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass transfer limitations, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is promoted, resulting in a decrease in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR Faradaic efficiency. Before CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supply reaches its maximum capacity, in neutral or alkaline conditions, increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR selectivity requires additional hydrogen source from solvent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protonation. However, it is challenging to concurrently achieve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation at single active site. Herein, we synthesized a neighboring Ni-Cr atomic pair configuration with distance of &#8764;2.7&#160;&#197;. COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element studies demonstrate that appropriate distance between dual active sites should be on the order of a few angstroms. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; XAS and soft NEXAFS characterizations indicate that the Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; promotes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and Cr-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accelerates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation. Theoretical investigations unveil the thermodynamic and kinetic superiorities of dual-active-site mechanism. Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cr-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits higher FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; than Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas Cr-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; displays a strong preference for HER. The zero-gap MEA attains &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt; of up to &#8722;1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; exceeding 85% at a cell voltage of &#8722;4.0&#160;V, and maintains stable operation for over 100&#160;h at a &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt; of &#8722;200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ampere&#8208;Level Membrane&#8208;Free Bipolar Ammonia Electrosynthesis with Faradaic Efficiency Exceeding 100% on a Surface&#8208;Reconstructed NiFe&#8208;Hydroxide</title>

NiFe&#8208;hydroxide was remolded into a high&#8208;performance NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalyst via cathodic electrochemical reconstruction, achieving &#8722;1.46&#160;A cm&#8722;2 current density and consistently high NH3 FEs across broad NO3&#8722; concentrations and potentials. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free paired electrolysis was developed, enabling bipolar NH3 production with FEs &gt;100% and subsequent valorization into 4.1&#160;g of methenamine.








Abstract
Awaking the force of materials for specific efficacy by precise electronic modulation remains a fundamental challenge in catalysis. Herein, we transform ordinary NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) into a high&#8208;performance NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalyst via cathodic electrochemical restructuring, which effectively induces oxygen vacancy (Ov) clusters preferentially localized around low&#8208;valence Ni sites. The resultant restructured NiFe&#8208;LDH (NiFe&#8208;LDH&#8208;R) demonstrates excellent concentration&#8208;universal NH3 electrosynthesis activity in 1&#160;M KOH, notably sustaining high Faradaic efficiencies (FEs, 88.5%&#8211;95%) across a broad potential range and attaining an ampere&#8208;level current density (&#8722;1.46&#160;A cm&#8722;2) together with a remarkable yield rate of 104.1&#160;mgNH3 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopic analyses reveal boosted hydrogenation kinetics and a thermodynamically favorable NOH pathway for NiFe&#8208;LDH&#8208;R, which is further decoded by theoretical calculations indicating that synergized Ov/Fe and low&#8208;valence Ni sites, respectively enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption and directional active hydrogen (*H) supply, thus streamlining overall energy barriers. Moreover, a new&#8208;style membrane&#8208;free bipolar electrosynthesis system is established, which enables unprecedent NH3 FEs exceeding 100% and scalable NH3 valorization into 4.1&#160;g of methenamine. This study rekindles power of electrochemical restructuring in catalyst advance and pioneers a new paradigm for energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical NH3 production and fixation.

         <title>Promoting Water Dissociation and Acetylene Transfer to Lower the Energy Consumption of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via Microenvironment Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an effective strategy for enhancing the kinetics of the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene by regulating the interfacial microenvironment, successfully reducing the energy consumption of the reaction. It has been demonstrated that the promotion of water dissociation and acetylene transfer are pivotal factors in enhancing the ethylene formation kinetics. This finding provides insights for the future design of catalysts.








Abstract
The critical challenge in the conversion of electrocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) is excessive energy consumption caused by sluggish hydrogenation kinetics, which still restricts its practical application potential. Herein, we theoretically and experimentally verify that concentrating surface&#8208;active hydrogen and C2H2 could accelerate hydrogenation kinetics, thereby reducing energy consumption. Then, electrochemically reduced copper (Cu) with abundant surfactants (ER&#8208;Cu) is proposed to modulate the microenvironment to regulate the interfacial species. Consequently, a partial current density of C2H4 (jC2H4) of 0.42 A cm&#8722;2 and a turnover frequency of 1.41 s&#8722;1 are achieved over ER&#8208;Cu, leading to an energy consumption reduction of 10.3% compared with the thermally reduced counterpart. A series of mechanistic explorations indicates that the as&#8208;prepared ER&#8208;Cu not only enhances water dissociation but also benefits the adsorption and mass transfer of C2H2 feedstocks due to the broken hydrogen bond network, resulting in lower energy consumption.

         <title>Photoinduced Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides for the Preparation of Cross&#8208;Linked Polypeptide Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ a photochemical approach for ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers to prepare covalently cross&#8208;linked synthetic polypeptide gels using a photobase and light, which offers significant advantages in the synthesis of polypeptides and holds great potential for applications requiring spatial and temporal control, such as additive manufacturing.








Abstract
Using light to activate chemical reactions is a powerful approach that allows spatiotemporal control over physicochemical transformations, commonly used in the polymerization and solidification of reactive liquids. Here, we employ a photochemical approach for ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers to prepare covalently cross&#8208;linked synthetic polypeptide gels using light. We apply 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate as a photocaged amine (base), where the switch in its activity after illumination is a key factor in controlling ROP. The released dibutylamine, as a basic species, can deprotonate the NCA and thereby initiate polymerization. We investigate the effects of 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl dibutyl carbamate on&#8197;&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate NCA polymerization and apply this approach to prepare covalently cross&#8208;linked polypeptide gels. We demonstrate excellent 2D spatiotemporal control over gelation, further enhanced by the use of an acid inhibitor that prevents overcuring caused by diffusion of active species from the illuminated region. The development of photoinduced polymerization and cross&#8208;linking of NCAs offers significant advantages in polypeptide synthesis and holds great potential for further applications in additive manufacturing.

This catalyst accelerates hole consumption by promoting the oxidation of H2O to H2O2, thereby enhancing the electron reduction of CO2 at the metal center.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction suffers from severe hole accumulation and inefficient electron utilization due to the sluggish kinetics of H2O oxidation to O2, thereby impeding the multi&#8208;electron C&#9472;C coupling process. This results in poor catalytic activity of C2 products. Herein, we have constructed a conjugated stacked thiophene&#8208;based supramolecular catalyst with extensive &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization by introducing a benzene ring. This effectively promotes the oxidation of H2O to H2O2, significantly accelerating hole consumption and thereby enhancing the electron reduction reaction of CO2 at the metal center. Under illumination, the C2H6 production rate reached 101.1 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with an electron selectivity as high as 98%. Compared to existing advanced systems, this represents an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude breakthrough in activity for C2 product synthesis. Research indicates that the enrichment of &#960; electrons on the benzene ring of the catalyst can stabilize the H2O oxidation intermediate *OH, consuming a significant number of holes to form H2O2. This process enhances the separation and migration of photo&#8208;generated electrons at the active center and promoting the *CO&#8208;bridged C&#9472;C coupling. This significantly increases the ability to reduce CO2 to C2 products. This work provides new insights into the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2H6 under pure H2O conditions.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic/Heterogeneous Catalytic Cascade for Selective Production of Propylene Oxide via Anodic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a cascade strategy for the selective synthesis of propylene oxide (PO) by coupling anodic H2O2 generation with TS&#8208;1 catalyzed propylene epoxidation. By immobilizing TS&#8208;1 on a gas diffusion layer, the system achieves high PO productivity with efficient H2O2 utilization, providing a safer and greener alternative to conventional PO production.








Abstract
Propylene oxide, a key intermediate with wide applications in the plastics industry, is still mainly produced by energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally non&#8208;sustainable processes. Electrochemically assisted epoxidation of propylene is emerging as a sustainable and atom&#8208;efficient method for highly selective synthesis of propylene oxide. Here, we introduce a cascade strategy that combines anodic H2O2 generation with propylene epoxidation at a porous layer of immobilized titanium silicate (TS&#8208;1). A ZnWO4 electrocatalyst was developed for efficient anodic H2O2 generation. To maximize local reactant concentrations, we designed an integrated TS&#8208;1&#8208;immobilized gas diffusion layer, which facilitates rapid propylene transport to the triple&#8208;phase boundaries, while preventing TS&#8208;1 loss and avoiding separation issues common in solution&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalytic systems. Furthermore, an acetonitrile&#8208;bicarbonate containing electrolyte system was optimized to facilitate direct utilization of H2O2 for propylene epoxidation, leading to 98% H2O2 utilization efficiency and over 97% selectivity for propylene oxide. This work offers a safer and greener alternative for propylene oxide production and broadens the application of electrochemically generated H2O2 from water oxidation for selective oxygenation reactions.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Enhanced Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Photocatalysis of the Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;centered acridine photocatalysts for direct hydrogen atom transfer have been developed, leveraging dispersion interactions to enhance photocatalytic activity. This approach enables diverse functionalization reactions of strong C&#9472;H bonds even under cryogenic conditions and provides a new strategy for boosting the efficiency of direct HAT photocatalysis. 








Abstract
The development of structurally distinct and modular photocatalysts for direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has emerged as a key frontier in radical&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H functionalization of strong carbon&#8211;hydrogen bonds. Despite the largely untapped potential across the fields of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science, few classes of direct HAT photocatalysts are currently known, and the approaches to enhancing their photocatalytic activity remain underdeveloped. We report herein the development of nitrogen&#8208;centered direct HAT photocatalysts based on the acridine framework, which leverage a C9&#8208;ortho&#8208;biaryl substituent for enhancing the photocatalytic activity through stabilizing dispersion interactions with the substrate as the key steering effect. The acridine direct HAT photocatalysis enables an array of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions in diverse structural and experimental settings, including cryogenic conditions. It also provides a blueprint for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of direct HAT catalysts by leveraging photocatalyst&#8208;substrate dispersion interactions.

         <title>Interfacial Synergy in NixMg1&#8208;xO/CeO2 for Efficient Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between NixMg1&#8208;xO solid solution with Ni single atoms and CeO2 in NixMg1&#8208;xO/CeO2 catalyst forms abundant Ni&#948;+&#8210;O&#8210;Ce structures, enhancing ammonia decomposition activity and stability. The interfacial synergy prevents H&#8208;poisoning of Ni single&#8208;atom active sites, and promotes N&#8210;H activation and subsequent N2 and H2 formation. This finding provides new ideas for designing efficient and durable ammonia decomposition catalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen production via ammonia decomposition presents a promising way to solve the difficulties of hydrogen storage and transportation. Ni&#8208;based catalysts have demonstrated promising catalytic activity for this reaction, making them a commercially viable choice, yet their activity and stability for industrial applications remain ongoing challenges. Here, we report a robust NixMg1&#8208;xO/CeO2 catalyst that overcomes these limitations. The catalyst composes of NixMg1&#8208;xO solid solution with atomic dispersed Ni and CeO2, and demonstrates an impressive 99.1% NH3 conversion close to the thermodynamic limitation at 525 &#176;C, and exceptional stability during reaction of 5,000 h at 550 &#176;C, outperforming Ni&#8208;based catalysts reported to date. Characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal a remarkable interfacial synergy effect between the NixMg1&#8208;xO solid solution and CeO2. Ni single atoms in NixMg1&#8208;xO efficiently activate N&#8210;H bond dissociation of NH3, and the resulting H atom readily spills over to CeO2, preventing H&#8208;poisoning of the Ni sites. Concurrently, CeO2 donates electrons to Ni, promoting the recombination of N species to form N2, thus boosting the overall performance. This study offers a general strategy for designing high&#8208;performance ammonia decomposition catalysts through the deliberate constructing interfacial active sites.

Combining high&#8208;throughput hyperspectral Raman imaging with a tailored machine learning algorithm, this platform enables spatially resolved, label&#8208;free identification of individual proteins in complex mixtures, culminating in addressable decoding maps.








Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein species within multicomponent systems remains a major challenge, yet is essential for next&#8208;generation molecular diagnostics and proteomic analysis. Here, we present a single&#8208;molecule Raman fingerprinting strategy for automatic digital decoding of protein compositions in complex systems. A dual&#8208;amplified, interface&#8208;coupled plasmonic nanocavity architecture synergistically integrates gap&#8208;mode coupling with surface plasmon resonance, generating ultralow&#8208;volume, highly enhanced hotspots that reproducibly confine and isolate single proteins, enabling acquisition of intrinsic Raman spectra free from spectral overlap. Using this platform, we achieve high&#8208;throughput hyperspectral Raman fingerprinting of seven representative proteins. A customized machine learning algorithm trained on single&#8208;molecule Raman datasets enables automatic identification and spatial mapping of individual protein species, yielding quantitative and addressable decoding maps. This broadly applicable strategy establishes an intelligent, data&#8208;driven framework for multiplexed protein analysis under ambient conditions, with far&#8208;reaching implications for molecular diagnostics, biosensing, and mechanistic studies of protein function.

         <title>Dual Co/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Highly Functional 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic regio&#8208; and stereoselective protocol for the synthesis of functionalized 1,3&#8208;dienes is presented that is facilitated via a dual Co/photoredox catalyst system while using modular 1,3&#8208;enynes and unsaturated carbonyl derivatives as substrates. Key to the success of this transformation is the generation of a Co(III)H species that adds to the 1,3&#8208;enyne thereby enabling the generation of a dienyl radical that couples to the carbonyl co&#8208;reactant through an outer&#8208;sphere process.








Abstract
A dual Co/photoredox catalytic coupling of 1,3&#8208;enynes and &#945;,&#223;&#8208;unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes and ketones has been developed that creates access to highly functional 1,3&#8208;diene synthons through a regio&#8208; and stereoselective carbon&#8208;carbon coupling process. The scope of the process features diverse functionalized scaffolds with a high degree of molecular complexity. The synthetic utility of these 1,3&#8208;dienes is demonstrated including a telescoped, one&#8208;pot approach using an alkynyl cyclic carbonate as a 1,3&#8208;enyne surrogate offering direct access to the 1,3&#8208;diene product. Mechanistic analysis involving control reactions, deuterium labeling studies and DFT calculations are in line with the in situ formation of a Co&#9472;H species and an outer&#8208;sphere coupling pathway in which a regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling occurs between a dienyl radical and carbonyl species.

         <title>An Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Nonporous Adaptive Framework Enables Photo&#8208;Regulated Desorption of Iodine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel nonporous adaptive frameworks (NAFs) featuring with bridged&#8208;azobenzene (b&#8208;Azo) units exhibits a remarkable iodine adsorption capacity (5.8&#160;g/g). The adsorbed iodine molecules can be readily released through UV irradiation, allowing for facile regeneration and reuse of the adsorbents. Mechanistic studies reveal that photo&#8208;regulated iodine molecules release is attributed to the transformation of b&#8208;Azo from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;configuration.








Abstract
Adsorption is one of the most convenient and efficient techniques for capturing and enriching various molecules. However, current strategies for the absorbent regeneration still face the challenges of labor&#8208;intensive and/or environmentally unfriendly procedures. In this study, a novel nonporous adaptive framework (NAF) was constructed through rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked azobenzene (Azo) bridges and flexible non&#8208;stacked amino joints. The precisely tuned flexibility of this framework enables adaptive and accessible pores, and sensitively photo&#8208;responsive behavior. The results demonstrate that Azo&#8208;NAF exhibits a remarkable iodine adsorption capacity up to 5.8&#160;g/g. Notably, the adsorbed iodine molecules can be readily released by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, allowing for facile regeneration and reuse of Azo&#8208;NAF. Mechanistic studies reveal that iodine molecules interact more strongly with cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;NAF than trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;NAF. Thus, accompanying the UV&#8208;induced transition from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;configuration of Azo units, the trapped iodine molecules are released from the framework. Moreover, this unique feature of Azo&#8208;NAF enables remote regulation of iodine&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions. Our finding thus provides a new design strategy for dynamic frameworks and establish how their switchable configurations can be harnessed for a tunable adsorption and desorption performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Antimony Nitride Sb3N5 and Polynitride Sb2N8 Featuring Single&#8208;Bonded N810&#8722; Chains</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;pressure reactions between Sb and molecular nitrogen in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell led to the formation of oC32&#8208;Sb3N5 (51(1) GPa) and mP20&#8208;Sb2(N8), (&gt; 100&#160;GPa). Both phases were identified by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray microdiffraction and are fully corroborated by density functional theory calculations. mP20&#8208;Sb2(N8) is the first oligonitride to contain previously unknown twisted single&#8208;bonded (N8)10&#8722; chains, whose characteristic vibrations were additionally identified by Raman spectroscopy. 








Abstract
High&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells provides a direct pathway to stabilize polymeric and oligomeric nitrogen units, often inaccessible under ambient conditions due to the stability of the N2 molecule. Here we report the high&#8208;pressure reactivity of antimony with molecular nitrogen, leading to the discovery of two distinct binary nitrides. At megabar pressures, we synthesized and structurally characterized mP20&#8208;Sb2(N8), the first pnictogen oligonitride containing unprecedented twisted single&#8208;bonded (N8)10&#8722; chains. The compound was identified by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray microdiffraction and Raman spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations. At lower pressures of &#8764;&#160;50&#160;GPa, we observed the formation of oC32&#8208;Sb3N5, complementing recent reports of this phase by the studies of its compressional behavior and stability field. These results significantly expand the interpnictogen chemistry and demonstrate the ability of antimony to stabilize unusual extended nitrogen fragments at high pressures.

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;Free Chaotropic Electrolyte Promoting Zinc Peroxide Chemistry for Non&#8208;Alkaline Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the hydrogen bond network along the Hofmeister series alternates the oxygen reduction reaction pathway in the non&#8208;alkaline zinc&#8211;air batteries. The reversible zinc peroxide chemistry is achieved in the fluorine&#8208;free chaotropic zinc perchlorate electrolyte for the first time by facilitating the zinc&#8208;rich, water&#8208;poor interfacial layer at the air cathode.








Abstract
Rechargeable non&#8208;alkaline zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) based on highly reversible zinc peroxide chemistry offer high energy density and superior stability under ambient air. However, the unique chemistry is closely related to the inner Helmholtz layer facilitated by the triflate anions, which has not been reported in other dilute fluorine&#8208;free electrolytes. There is still a lack of selection criteria for anions and benchmarking two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) selectivity. Herein, the Hofmeister series was introduced to depict the hydrophobicity of anions. Integrated spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses demonstrate that chaotropic anions promote 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity by disrupting the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and decreasing interfacial water at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. As proof of concept, a fluorine&#8208;free chaotropic electrolyte, zinc perchlorate (Zn(ClO4)2), is proposed to enable efficient zinc peroxide chemistry for ZABs without requiring specialized cell configuration. The ZABs using Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte not only exhibit improved reaction kinetics and higher energy efficiency but also reduced cost compared to fluorine&#8208;containing counterparts. This study provides new insights into electrolyte design strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and durable ZABs based on zinc peroxide chemistry.

     alt="A Fluorine-Free Chaotropic Electrolyte Promoting Zinc Peroxide Chemistry for Non-Alkaline Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulating the hydrogen bond network along the Hofmeister series alternates the oxygen reduction reaction pathway in the non-alkaline zinc&#8211;air batteries. The reversible zinc peroxide chemistry is achieved in the fluorine-free chaotropic zinc perchlorate electrolyte for the first time by facilitating the zinc-rich, water-poor interfacial layer at the air cathode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable non-alkaline zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) based on highly reversible zinc peroxide chemistry offer high energy density and superior stability under ambient air. However, the unique chemistry is closely related to the inner Helmholtz layer facilitated by the triflate anions, which has not been reported in other dilute fluorine-free electrolytes. There is still a lack of selection criteria for anions and benchmarking two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) selectivity. Herein, the Hofmeister series was introduced to depict the hydrophobicity of anions. Integrated spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses demonstrate that chaotropic anions promote 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity by disrupting the hydrogen-bond network and decreasing interfacial water at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. As proof of concept, a fluorine-free chaotropic electrolyte, zinc perchlorate (Zn(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is proposed to enable efficient zinc peroxide chemistry for ZABs without requiring specialized cell configuration. The ZABs using Zn(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte not only exhibit improved reaction kinetics and higher energy efficiency but also reduced cost compared to fluorine-containing counterparts. This study provides new insights into electrolyte design strategies for developing low-cost and durable ZABs based on zinc peroxide chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pulse&#8208;Constructed Cu&#948;+/CuOx Reduces the C&#9472;Cl Dipole Moment to Enable Complete Deuterodechlorination of Trichloroacetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed electrolysis enables the in situ construction of Cu&#948;+/CuOx dual sites while maintaining their stability, which promotes the coadsorption of the C&#9472;Cl bond and &#9472;COOH group, significantly reducing the C&#9472;Cl dipole moment and thereby promoting complete dechlorination. Over 70&#160;h of electrosynthesis of 20&#160;g of CD3COOH in D2O and the boosted performance of hydrogenation and deuteration of other chlorides, highlighting the prospects of this strategy.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic deuterodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid with D2O provides a high single&#8208;pass deuterium ratio avenue for the synthesis of acetic&#8208;d3 acid at room temperature. However, increasing C&#9472;Cl dipole moments via stepwise dechlorination, and gradual active site deactivation make active and stable complete dechlorination highly challenging. Here, metastable Cu&#948;+/CuOx dual sites are constructed in situ and maintained under pulsed electrolysis, enabling 70&#160;h of stable electrosynthesis of acetic&#8208;d3 acid with a 97% deuterium ratio. Surface copper oxides are formed in situ and then convert to Cu&#948;+/CuOx when the oxidation and reduction potentials are intermittently applied, which enhances C&#9472;Cl adsorption to promote electron transfer to Cl atoms and attracts &#9472;COOH to increase the electronegativity of the C atom of C&#9472;Cl, remarkably reducing the C&#9472;Cl dipole moment and promoting complete dechlorination. The fast electrosynthesis of 20&#160;g of CD3COOH with applications in the deuterium labeling of drugs and DNA bases and markedly increased yields in the hydrogenation/deuteration of other chlorides and bromides demonstrate the methodology's potential.

         <title>Orbital Charge Exchange Transition Conceptually Activates Multi&#8208;Bifunctional Li&#8211;O2 and Li&#8211;CO2 Pathways at Deep and Shallow Energy Levels in Li&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

The ligand rearrangement of Ce2Mo3O12 leads to Ce&#9472;O&#9472;Mo exchange transition for efficient electrons injection into HOMO of O2 and LUMO of CO2, leading to highly efficient catalytic ability toward Li2O2 and Li2CO3 during multiphase catalytic process with an ultralong cycle life of 600 cycles at 500 mA g&#8722;1 in LABs.








Abstract
In Li&#8208;air batteries (LABs), the deep and shallow orbital distributions of reactants in Li&#8211;O2 and Li&#8211;CO2 pathways in ambient air pose a conceptual predicament for designing cathode catalysts that can precisely activate multi&#8208;functional electrocatalysis at different energy levels with a large energy gap. Following the design guideline of optimizing deep and shallow band structures, an orbital charge exchange transition strategy was applied to tailor the electronic structure of Ce2Mo3O12 as a potential catalyst. Theoretical investigation predicts the oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced ligand rearrangement tendency and the orbital charge exchange transition from a f&#8208;p&#8208;f super exchange between Ce&#9472;O&#9472;Ce sites to a f&#8208;p&#8208;d double exchange mode between Ce&#9472;O&#9472;Mo hetero&#8208;sites. This motivates the low&#8208;lying Ce 2e orbitals for Li&#8211;O2 pathways and gains a charge&#8208;filled shallow Mo d&#8208;band for Li&#8211;CO2 pathways. Importantly, the XANES and related electronic and crystal structure analysis, quantitative electrocatalysis investigation and high battery performance perfectly identify the reliability of the theoretical prediction. Consequently, the Ce2Mo3O12 cathode exhibited stable operation for nearly 600 cycles in ambient air with excellent humidity tolerance and an impressive energy density of 1560 Wh kg&#8722;1 for pouch cells as power sources of electric devices, marking a significant step for the practical application of LABs.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Induced Interfacial&#8208;Potential Regulation Stabilizes Micron&#8208;Sized Silicon Anodes in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A zwitterion&#8208;modified quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte stabilizes micron&#8208;sized silicon anodes through interfacial&#8208;potential regulation via three synergistic mechanisms: electrostatic screening equalizes potential across Helmholtz layers, homogenizing lithium&#8208;ion flux; lithium&#8211;sulfonate coordination promotes an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase; and optimized fluoroethylene carbonate distribution enables uniform passivation. This establishes interfacial&#8208;potential regulation as an independent axis for controlling alloy anode interfaces.








Abstract
Micron&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;&#8208;Si) is an attractive anode material for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to its high tap density, large specific capacity, and compatibility with scalable manufacturing. Its practical deployment, however, is impeded by an uncontrolled interfacial&#8208;potential landscape that drives heterogeneous Li+ transport, spatially non&#8208;uniform reduction and recurrent solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rupture, thereby accelerating capacity fade. Here, we report a zwitterion&#8208;modified quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte that regulates the interfacial&#8208;potential distribution at the &#956;&#8208;Si/electrolyte interface. In situ polymerization of 3&#8208;(1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolyl)propanesulfonate (VIPS) within a conventional carbonate electrolyte yields PVIPSE, whose spatially proximate imidazolium and sulfonate groups stabilize &#956;&#8208;Si anodes through synergistic effects: (i) electrostatic screening that equalizes potential across the inner/outer Helmholtz planes and homogenizes Li+ flux; (ii) Li+&#8211;sulfonate coordination that restructures the solvation environment and biases reduction pathways toward an inorganic&#8208;rich, electronically insulating SEI; and (iii) selective partitioning of fluoroethylene carbonate at the interface to promote uniform LiF&#8208;rich passivation. Scanning electrochemical microscopy directly visualizes the reduced interfacial&#8208;potential heterogeneity and improved SEI uniformity. As a result, the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state PVIPSE enables stable long&#8208;term cycling of &#956;&#8208;Si anodes, establishing interfacial&#8208;potential regulation as a distinct and effective design principle, orthogonal to solvation engineering and mechanical reinforcement, for stabilizing high&#8208;capacity alloying anodes.

Abstract
Digital light processing (DLP) of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) enables the fabrication of complex architectures for soft robotics and energy&#8208;dissipative devices. However, conventional photocuring of LCE relies exclusively on radical&#8208;mediated polymerization, which involves acrylates homopolymerization inevitably, resulting in heterogeneous networks with uneven crosslinks, high crosslinking density and unreacted groups, leading to low rate of acceptable products due to cracking and constrained mesogen reorientation. It exhibits significantly higher defect rate for the products and printing cost, while compromising the material performance like damping and actuation behaviors. Here, we report a non&#8208;radical 3D printing strategy of LCEs using photobase generator (PBG). It promotes precise selectively thiol&#8211;acrylate Michael&#8208;addition, forming a homogenous network of low crosslinking density without residue thiols. It prevents cracking and guarantees a high success rate in printing. Also, it achieves the softest among all photocured LCEs with the Young's modulus of 1.69&#160;MPa. Moreover, it liberates LC mesogen for easier reorientation, achieving higher actuation strain of 97% (&lt;70% for radical&#8208;based counterparts) and a soft elasticity plateau 3 times wider, and enhancing damping capacity through synergistic mesogen reorientation and 3D architectural design. This strategy provides a high success route to high&#8208;performance 3D printed LCEs for soft robotics and impact protection.

         <title>A Stable Triindenobenzotrithiophene Triradical with Equilateral Ferromagnetic Spin Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell molecular scaffold of triindenobenzotrithiophene is rationally designed to construct carbon&#8208;based oligoradicals having a high&#8208;spin ground state with optimal air stability. By tuning the spin delocalization and distribution features to improve the inherent stability while synergistically exploiting the steric shielding effects to counter the dimerization tendency, a novel quartet triradical showing long persistence in ambient air is successfully accomplished, and its outstanding quantum spin addressability is illustrated.








Abstract
Persistent carbon&#8208;centered polyradicals with high&#8208;spin ground states have received increasing attention for their unique magnetic and quantum technological applications. Yet, balancing the high spin density, favoring robust ferromagnetic (FM) coupling, with chemo&#8208;stability presents a significant challenge. Here, a molecule featuring a central benzotrithiophene fused with three indeno&#8208;radicals is designed to address this dilemma. The initially synthesized trianthryl&#8208;substituted triradical (TR1) undergoes rapid cyclo&#8208;dimerization and yields a stable &#963;&#8208;dimeric diradical. Upon further structural modifications to enhance the steric blocking effect, dimerization is successfully prevented, and a new persistent triradical TR2 is achieved, exhibiting a half&#8208;life time of 191&#160;h in air&#8208;saturated solution and 398&#160;h in solid state. The continuous&#8208;wave (cw) and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, along with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, unambiguously verify a quartet (S&#160;=&#160;3/2) ground state with &#916;ED&#8722;Q of 0.41&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Notably, TR2 exhibits a zero&#8208;field splitting parameter |D| of up to 115&#160;MHz, affording well&#8208;resolved and individually addressable spin transitions, as confirmed by nutation experiments. These features offer a viable organic platform for quantum spin&#8208;manipulation studies.

         <title>Local Oxygen Chemical Potential Determines Cobalt&#8208;Ceria Interfacial Catalysis in CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
These results demonstrate for the first time that the local oxygen chemical potential, set by the external atmosphere and modulated by the surface reaction pathway, determines the structure of restructured cobalt/ceria catalysts and their resulting catalytic performances through a combined thermodynamics&#8208;guided strategy with experimental models initiated from distinct supported cobalt precursor structures. 2








Abstract
Exploring the restructuring mechanism of solid catalysts is of pivotal importance for the rational design of efficient catalysts, yet remains a significant challenge. Traditional chemical potential theory assumes a spatially uniform gas reservoir with a well&#8208;defined chemical potential but neglected the spatial variations induced by surface reactions, mass transportation, and temperature gradients in the operando conditions. Here, we employ a thermodynamics&#8208;guided strategy, integrated with experimental models initiated from distinct precursor structures, to demonstrate the structure of restructured catalyst determined by the local oxygen chemical potential (&#956;O). Using cobalt&#8208;ceria catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, comprehensive characterizations reveal that supported cobalt species undergo in situ restructuring during reaction processes, either reducing oxidative cobalt species to lower oxidation states or oxidizing metallic cobalt to positive valence states, ultimately forming CoOx ensembles with Co(II) as the primary component. Starting from either metallic Co or CoOx, the resulting differences in catalytic activity modify the local atmosphere and the &#956;O near catalyst surface. This leads to the formation of distinct CoOx ensembles, which in turn dictate the divergent catalytic performance. These findings provide a comprehensive physical picture elucidating the intrinsic correlation between the environmental atmosphere and corresponding structure of restructured catalysts.

Big is beautiful? The performance of 0.2&#160;M low concentration lithium electrolytes with large weakly coordinating anions [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722; and [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722; in low viscosity ortho&#8208;difluorobenzene solution is tested in comparison to standard 1.0&#160;M as well as diluted 0.2&#160;M carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes with Li[PF6] conducting salt. Lithium ion / lithium metal batteries were tested symmetric, half, and full cells.








Abstract
0.2&#160;M Low Concentration Electrolytes (LCEs) for lithium&#8208;based batteries formed from lithium salts with very weakly coordinating anions, i.e., the aluminate Li[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] and the gallate Li[Ga(C2F5)4] in ortho&#8208;difluorobenzene (o&#8208;DFB), showed competitive conductivity to classical electrolytes of up to 5.0&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C combined with electrochemical stability at least up to 4.5&#160;V vs. Li/Li+. Given that a stoichiometric amount of 2 equivalents dimethoxyethane (DME) per lithium ion (as Li+ complexing agent) and 2&#160;wt.% fluoroethylene carbonate (as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) former) were present in the LCEs, half and full&#8208;cell measurements confirmed stable LCE cycling over 300 cycles in Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8208;Batteries. Even at high currents (5C), the discharge retained two thirds of the practical 1C capacities of NMC622. By contrast, a LCE made from 0.2&#160;M LiPF6 in EC/EMC 3:7 solution already led at a 2C rate to cell death, while a simple switch of the conducting salt to 0.2&#160;M Li[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] led to stable cycling including rate tests for over 300 cycles and approached closely the values of the standard 1.0&#160;M LiPF6 electrolyte in EC/EMC 3:7 &#8211; attributed to the anions&#8217; stability. The performance of the aluminate LCE was further evaluated in symmetrical Li&#8208;Li cells and Lithium&#8208;Metal&#8208;Batteries containing 48&#160;&#181;m thin Lithium&#8208;Metal&#8208;Anodes (LMAs): LCEs improved the cell's lifetime by a factor of 3&#8211;6 at a current density of 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Scanning electron microscope/energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray and potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements confirmed the exceptional stabilization of the LMAs by the aluminate LCE throughout the cycling, especially when combined with an artificial, adaptive and self&#8208;healing SEI based on Li[PO2(OCH2CF3)2]. The solvation structure of standard and LCEs was investigated by NMR spectroscopic diffusion measurements and quantum chemical calculations. A three&#8208;to&#8208;fourfold increased Li ion mobility was found in LCEs compared to the system with 0.2&#160;M LiPF6 in standard carbonate solution. The presence of stable and compact Li(DME)2+ structures as moving ions was shown and the relevance of Li+ ions solvated with fluoro&#8208;ethylene carbonate or o&#8208;DFB for SEI&#8208;formation is discussed.

         <title>Interface Molecular Locking Synergized with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel interface molecular locking (IML) strategy synergized with self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for perovskite solar cells. A high&#8208;coverage hole&#8208;selective layer is formed through combining the advantages of two SAMs. Additionally, thiabendazole is introduced into the perovskite precursor to achieve molecular locking at the buried interface. Consequently, the optimized devices achieve efficiencies exceeding 26.0% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
The uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the interfacial defects in perovskite films significantly affect the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, we develop an innovative interface molecular locking (IML) strategy synergized with SAMs to enhance the properties of buried interface. Specifically, two SAMs&#8212;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz) and 5&#8208;indoleboronic acid (5&#8208;IBA)&#8212;are employed to combine their advantages and form an enhanced SAM (E&#8208;SAM). Due to the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between MeO&#8208;PhPACz and 5&#8208;IBA, the E&#8208;SAM exhibits a denser and more uniform morphological coverage. Introducing thiabendazole (TBZ) additive into the perovskite precursor further ameliorates the buried interface properties through its self&#8208;assembly behavior, owing to its large molecular dipole moment and strong interactions with the E&#8208;SAM. This strategy not only achieves favorable energy level alignment but also improves the crystallinity and reduces the trap density of perovskite films, thereby significantly enhancing hole extraction and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, both (FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 and FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3&#8208;based IPSCs achieve high efficiencies exceeding 26.0%, along with significantly enhanced stability. Notably, (FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 solar cells deliver a high voltage of 1.21&#160;V, one of the highest reported among IPSCs with a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap. Our findings provide unique insights into achieving high&#8208;performance IPSCs by synergistically engineering buried interface.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Channel with Side Pockets for Rapid Diffusion and Efficient C2H2 Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar&#8208;layered MOF (JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3) featuring one&#8208;dimensional channels with orthogonally arrayed side pockets enables dense packing of C2H2 while maintaining rapid diffusion, achieving gas&#8208;cylinder collection of high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt;99.9%) from C2H2/CO2 mixtures.








Abstract
Efficiently separating acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) has been a long&#8208;standing challenge due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. Herein, we report a series of isostructural pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), named JNU&#8208;13, JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3, and JNU&#8208;13&#8208;(CH3)2. These MOFs feature one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels integrated with orthogonally arrayed side pockets, enabling dense packing of C2H2 molecules while maintaining rapid diffusion pathways. Specifically, JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3 achieves a high C2H2 packing density of 360 g L&#8722;1, a low adsorption enthalpy of 31.61 kJ mol&#8722;1, and adsorption/desorption coefficients one to two orders of magnitude higher than other benchmark MOFs. Breakthrough experiments reveal a high C2H2 capture capacity of 3.46 mmol g&#8722;1 from an equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixture at 298 K and 1 bar, even under humid conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the scale&#8208;up synthesis of JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3 and gas&#8208;cylinder collection of high&#8208;purity C2H2, achieving &gt;99.9% from a C2H2/CO2 (95/5) mixture and &gt;99.7% from a C2H2/CO2/CH4 (95/2.5/2.5) mixture. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of orthogonal&#8208;arrayed side pockets for balancing dense packing and mass transport, offering a promising strategy for energy&#8208;efficient C2H2 purification.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Orchestration for Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MoS2&#8211;MnO2&#8208;electrolyte triple&#8208;interface design enables coordinated charge regulation across multi&#8208;sacles at the interface, which simutaneously optimze interfacial charge transfer, H2O dissociation, and local pH environments. This synergistic control markedly enhances Mn4+/Mn3+ redox kinetics and reversibility, delivering long&#8208;life, high&#8208;rate aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries offer a compelling solution for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;cost, and safe energy storage, yet their cycle life remains inadequate for practical applications. This instability stems from intertwined H&#8314;/OH&#8722; interfacial reactions and the intrinsically low conductivity of MnO2, leading to poor redox reversibility and electrode passivation. Here, we report a MoS2&#8211;MnO2&#8211;electrolyte triple&#8208;interface design that enables interfacial charge orchestration to reshape interfacial chemistry and charge transport dynamics. MoS2 catalyzes H2O dissociation to facilitate efficient H&#8314;&#8208;redox, while Mo sites stabilize the interfacial pH via OH&#8722; adsorption. Concurrently, the MoS2&#8211;MnO2 heterojunction accelerates electron transfer through synergistic chemical&#8208;electrochemical pathways. The resulting Zn||MoS2&#8211;MnO2 cells deliver extraordinary durability, maintaining 92.7% capacity after 10,000 cycles at 20&#160;C, and pouch&#8208;scale devices with 5.2&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 high areal capacity exhibit stable cycling. This work establishes a cross&#8208;scale strategy in which ordered interfacial charge orchestration couples microenvironment regulation with multi&#8208;step transport control, advancing aqueous Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;level application.

         <title>Bidirectional Photoregulated Chromism in Pyridinium Derivatives via Secondary Excitation&#8208;Driven Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bidirectional photoswitching between the pyridinium cation and its radical state has been realized through a secondary&#8208;excitation strategy. This study marks the first demonstration of dynamic chromism between pyridinium redox states mediated by UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR light. Crucially, the unique radical quenching mechanism generates environment&#8208;sensitive photothermal properties, thereby enabling advanced application.








Abstract
The key challenge for photochromic pyridinium derivatives is the difficulty in precisely modulating their reverse process. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a secondary excitation strategy to achieve bidirectional photoswitching between the pyridinium cation and its radical state, thus permitting precise control over the dynamic chromic behavior. Owing to the electron&#8208;deficient nature of the pyridinium derivative, the intensely colored radical state is generated via a photoinduced electron transfer process under UV light irradiation. The extended absorption band of this radical, originating from the &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular structure, endows it with the capability to respond to both visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Subsequent excitation within this band elevates the radical to a higher&#8208;energy state, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer to O2 molecule and enabling rapid, light&#8208;driven recovery to the initial state. This work marks the first demonstration of UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR light&#8208;mediated dynamic chromism between pyridinium redox states. Notably, the strong NIR responsiveness and unique radical quenching mechanism endow the material with distinctive environment&#8208;sensitive photothermal properties, and establish a novel platform for erasable photoprinting and advanced information encryption/decryption systems.

&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional photoswitching between the pyridinium cation and its radical state has been realized through a secondary-excitation strategy. This study marks the first demonstration of dynamic chromism between pyridinium redox states mediated by UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR light. Crucially, the unique radical quenching mechanism generates environment-sensitive photothermal properties, thereby enabling advanced application.

         <title>Pyroglutamate PTMs as Bioorthogonal Reactive Handles: Ru/Ni Photoredox Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel photoredox catalytic system enables site&#8208;selective C&#8211;N arylation of N&#8208;terminal pyroglutamate residues in peptides and proteins under mild aqueous conditions. This work establishes pyroglutamate as a new, bioorthogonal handle for bioconjugation and expands the scope of photoredox chemistry in biomolecular modification.








Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play essential roles in living systems. However, the biological roles of some PTMs, such as N&#8208;terminal pyroglutamate, are poorly understood due to a dearth of chemical and/or biological tools to label, quantify, or identify pyroglutamate residues. In this report, we describe a photoredox catalysis process that enables direct pyroglutamate N&#8211;H arylation in peptides and proteins, using (hetero)aryl bromide reagents. The reactivity demonstrates the potential for multi&#8208;point binding to recognize peptide backbone structures for exquisitely chemoselective modifications in complex polyfunctional environments. The results provide the first chemical tool to modify pyroglutamate residues within complex polypeptides in biocompatible aqueous environments.

Adamantyl trimethyladamantyl&#8208;flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) modulated DArP provides a general synthetic platform for OMIECs with tailored backbone and parallel side chain variations, which accelerates the exploration of structure&#8208;mixed transport correlation as well as optimization of high mobility&#8208;volumetric capacitance OMIECs. The as&#8208;obtained champion polymer demonstrates a benchmark &#181;C* of 632.10 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and potential for solid&#8208;state neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) has been developed as a straightforward method for synthesis of conjugated polymers. However, it encounters severe incompatibility with polymer&#8208;based organic mixed ionic and electronic conductors (OMIECs) that are essential for neuromorphic engineering and bioelectronics. Herein, we demonstrate trimethyladamantyl&#8208;flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands motivated DArP of OMIECs. Significant steric bulkiness of such ligands shields the catalytic palladium centers against chelating chains in OMIECs. Consequently, adamantyl NHCs modulated DArP provides a general synthetic platform for OMIECs with tailored backbone and side chain variations. Furthermore, this methodology accelerates the exploration of structure&#8208;mixed transport correlation as well as optimization of high mobility&#8208;volumetric capacitance OMIECs. Through these advancements, we contribute an innovative toolkit to the synthetic repertoire of mixed conducting polymers.

         <title>Engineering Protein&#8208;Based Nanofiltration Membranes with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Pores via Amyloid&#8208;Like Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological ion channels and transmembrane proteins, a transformative general strategy was proposed to push the pore size of synthetic protein&#8208;based membranes to the sub&#8208;nanometer via amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation. The ion separation performance is enhanced by tuning the membrane pore size and surface charge through polyphenol cross&#8208;linking, offering a novel route toward high&#8208;performance biomimetic separation membranes.








Abstract
Membrane proteins in biology achieve highly efficient selective molecular recognition and transmembrane transport by constructing sub&#8208;nanometer channels. However, achieving comparable selectivity in artificial protein&#8208;based membranes remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the difficulty of precisely tailoring sub&#8208;nanometer pore sizes. Here, we present a breakthrough in the fabrication of proteinaceous nanofiltration membranes with precisely defined sub&#8208;nanometer pores. A robust protein membrane with pore sizes of 0.62&#8211;0.81&#160;nm is formed at the air/water interface via a thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction. Subsequent crosslinking with polyphenol further reduces the pore size to &#8764;0.4&#160;nm, while simultaneously inverting surface charge from positive to negative and markedly enhancing ion sieving performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the crosslinked amyloid&#8208;like protein membrane achieves 98.24% rejection of MgCl2 and an excellent Mg2+/Li+ selectivity of 88.65 in a simulated salt&#8208;lake brine, surpassing the performance of most polymer membranes reported to date. Additionally, this membrane demonstrates versatility in separating anions with different valences, removing heavy metal ions, and eliminating persistent organic pollutants, while exhibiting excellent chemical stability and anti&#8208;fouling capability in acidic, alkaline, and organic solvent environments. By harnessing the precision of biological channels, this work offers a paradigm shift for next&#8208;generation biomimetic ion separation, environmental remediation, and water purification applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Molecular Flexibility in Enhancing Pyridine Based Defect Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study on two pyridine&#8208;based passivators, flexible 2PYET and rigid 2PYBEN, reveals how backbone flexibility dictates performance. The flexible core of 2PYET not only enhances defect&#8208;coordinating ability but, crucially, suppresses detrimental molecular aggregation. This facilitates a uniform, ordered passivation layer on the perovskite surface, which is key to achieving high performance and operational stability. 








Abstract
Molecular modulation of the perovskite/C60 interface to reduce defect density plays a decisive role in achieving high&#8208;efficiency and stable inverted perovskite solar cells. However, the impact of substituent flexibility on passivation performance remains insufficiently understood. Here, two structurally analogous pyridine&#8208;based molecules with distinct central substituents 1, 2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl) ethane (2PYET) featuring a flexible alkyl chain and 1, 4&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl) benzene (2PYBEN) possessing a rigid phenyl core are designed to elucidate the role of molecular flexibility in perovskite surface passivation. Our study reveals that the flexible central substituent significantly enhances the electron cloud density of the pyridine groups, thereby improving their passivation capability, while simultaneously suppressing molecular aggregation and promoting better interfacial contact. As a result, devices modified with 2PYET achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.03% for 0.09 cm2 devices and 24.45% for 1.0 cm2 devices.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii Capsular Polysaccharide Fragments as Leads for Cross&#8208;Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A total of 16 chemically synthesized capsular polysaccharide (CPS) fragments related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii were analyzed by glycan microarray. Comparative screening revealed three conserved epitopes that act as cross&#8208;protective vaccine lead candidates against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens.








Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are listed by the World Health Organization as high&#8208;priority multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) pathogens, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii is classified as the critical&#8208;priority group. These bacteria cause life&#8208;threatening infections such as severe bloodstream, nosocomial, urinary tract, and soft&#8208;tissue infections. Their cell surfaces display complex and structurally distinct glycans absent in host cells, making them targets for glycoconjugate vaccine and diagnostic research. In this study, we report the chemical synthesis of mono&#8208; and oligosaccharide fragments derived from three ESKAPE pathogens, P. aeruginosa O11, S. aureus (CP5, CP8, and strain M), and A. baumannii (S34 and&#160;O5), as well as Plesiomonas shigelloides O1. Glycan microarray screening revealed three epitopes exhibiting strong cross&#8208;reactive immunogenicity against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. baumannii, demonstrating that a trisaccharide represents the minimal epitope required to elicit cross&#8208;protective immune responses. The key features of P. aeruginosa O11 trisaccharide synthesis involve efficient assembly of a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;linked l&#8208;FucNAc&#8211;linker motif, followed by regioselective glycosylation at O3 and subsequently at O2 of the d&#8208;Glc&#8211;l&#8208;FucNAc&#8211;linker disaccharide. The same strategy was applied for assembling its tetrasaccharide fragment. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;mannosylation and 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;d&#8208;FucNAc linkage formations were optimized for the S. aureus CP8 fragment, establishing a versatile route toward bacterial glycans relevant for vaccine and diagnostic development.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;fluoreno&#8208;imidazole (SFI) Emitters Efficiently Harvesting Hot Excitons for Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIEy Below 0.046</title>

A rigid spiro&#8208;fluoreno&#8208;imidazole (SFI) scaffold enables a new class of deep&#8208;blue hot exciton emitters. Tailored SFI derivatives exhibit capabilities of ultrafast high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing and efficient hot triplet exciton harvesting. Devices based on tCz&#8208;SFI deliver the remarkable 12.55% external quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates of (0.161, 0.043), establishing a benchmark for deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Hot exciton emitters have emerged as promising candidates for efficient deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), by enabling triplet exciton harvesting through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing. However, limited molecular catalogues impede comprehensive mechanistic investigations and device performance elevations. Here, for the first time, we introduced a novel rigid and steric spiro&#8208;fluoreno&#8208;fused imidazole (SFI) skeleton to engineer high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue hot exciton emitters. Three derivatives, Cz&#8208;SFI, tCz&#8208;SFI, and 3Cz&#8208;SFI, were strategically designed to modulate donor&#8208;acceptor orbital overlap and hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer character. Detailed theoretical calculations and transient absorption spectra clearly revealed the dominant channel of high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing, with a rapid rate constant up to 3.36&#160;&#215;&#160;109 s&#8722;1. Remarkably, the tCz&#8208;SFI&#8208;based OLED device achieved deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 83.2% and an unprecedented external quantum efficiency of 12.55% by efficiently harvesting hot triplet excitons. The device exhibited stable electroluminescence peaking at 410&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.161, 0.043), setting a new benchmark for deep&#8208;blue hot&#8208;exciton OLEDs.

         <title>Atomically Isolated Cd Sites Boosting CO Electroreduction to C2+ Alcohols at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Cd&#8208;SACs@Cu NS electrocatalyst, Cd can regulate the electron cloud density around the Cu active sites, enhancing the adsorption of the *CO intermediate. In addition, The Cd site can provide a quantitative amount of H+, thereby facilitating the hydrogenation reaction of carbon&#8208;based intermediate products (especially *CH2CHO). Therefore, under high current density conditions, Cd&#8208;SACs@Cu NS exhibits high selectivity for C2+ alcohols.








Abstract
Herein, two Cu&#8208;based model electrocatalysts, Cu nanosheets modified with Cd single atoms (Cd&#8208;SACs@Cu NS) and unmodified Cu nanosheets (Cu NS), were rationally designed to investigate the C&#8211;C coupling to C2+ alcohols mechanisms in CORR. Compared to Cu NS, Cd&#8208;SACs@Cu NS exhibits a significantly enhanced Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ alcohols of nearly 70% at an unprecedented current density of 1100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains a higher FE (&gt;50%) over a broad range of current densities (100&#8211;2100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) under alkaline conditions in a flow cell. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that the enhanced selectivity toward C2+ alcohols on Cd&#8208;SACs@Cu NS is attributed to the improved H2O dissociation at atomically dispersed Cd sites and enhanced CO adsorption on the paired Cu atoms adjacent to single Cd atoms. These effects synergistically facilitate the spillover of hydrogen atoms from Cd to Cu sites, thereby promoting the protonation at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of *CH2CHO, which leads to the selective formation of C2+ alcohols. In contrast, the unmodified Cu NS is prone to promoting the cleavage of the C&#9472;O bond, thereby facilitating the generation of C2H4.

         <title>Hierarchical Helical Toroids Constructed from One&#8208;pot Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly of Polypeptides</title>

         <dc:description>
Hierarchical nanostructures involving chiral and toroidal features are rarely observed, and related mechanism is less understood. This work reports a first example of a straightforward and controllable approach for constructing uniform helical nanotoroids by one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of polypeptides.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be a robust strategy for constructing intricate hierarchical structures. The construction of chiral or toroidal nanostructures has attracted considerable attention. However, hierarchical nanostructures involving both chiral and toroidal features are rarely reported and related mechanism is less understood. Herein, we report a discovery of toroids with controllable helical senses from the one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of polypeptides. Through the addition of selective solvent to polypeptide solution and the followed dialysis, uniform toroids with left&#8208;handed helical structures are formed. Mechanism analysis revealed that the polypeptides are initially assembled into spherical aggregates, then the spheres perforated into toroids during the dialysis process. Simultaneously, chain rearrangement occurs, resulting in an ordered packing of polypeptides within the toroids and the formation of helical structures. The formation of helical toroids can be well controlled by the assembly conditions, and its chirality was found to be dependent on the polypeptide backbone chirality. This is a pioneering example of one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of hierarchical structures containing multiple topological features, providing a straightforward efficient strategy for constructing complicated nanostructures with chiral and toroidal features.

         <title>Operando Tracking of Hydrazine Intermediate Reveals the Gerischer&#8211;Marcus Pathway for Ammonia Electrooxidation on Oxygen&#8208;Deficient CuO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive AIE&#8208;ECL probe enables the direct capture and quantification of the elusive N2H4 intermediate. Combined with in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, this operando tracking reveals that oxygen vacancies in CuO steer the ammonia electro&#8208;oxidation reaction exclusively via the Gerischer&#8211;Marcus pathway, unraveling the critical link between atomic&#8208;scale defects and electrocatalytic mechanism.








Abstract
The ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AOR) represents a pivotal process for sustainable energy technologies, yet its mechanism on non&#8208;precious metal catalysts remains ambiguous, primarily due to the elusive nature of key reaction intermediates. Specifically, the role of oxygen vacancies (Ov) in steering the AOR pathway is not well understood. Herein, we directly captured the hydrazine (N2H4) intermediate, which unequivocally confirms the operation of the Gerischer&#8211;Marcus (G&#8211;M) pathway on oxygen&#8208;deficient copper oxide (CuO). This breakthrough was enabled by an aggregation&#8208;induced emission electrochemiluminescence (AIE&#8208;ECL) probe, which allows quantitative, real&#8208;time detection of N2H4 with ultrahigh sensitivity (0.163&#160;nM). The direct visualization of probe consumption via fluorescence microscopy imaging provided orthogonal validation. Combined with in situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we establish that oxygen vacancies (Ov) act as a &#8220;steering wheel&#8221; to preferentially stabilize N2H4 and channel the reaction preferentially along the G&#8211;M route. A direct correlation between Ov concentration and N2H4 accumulation is demonstrated, linking atomic&#8208;scale defect structure to macroscopic catalytic performance. This work not only presents a paradigm for probing elusive electrocatalytic intermediates but also delivers a fundamental principle for influencing reaction pathways through defect engineering.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Bisabosqual F via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisabosquals are unusual meroterpenoids from Stachybotrys containing a benzopyran/benzopyran core. Herein, we report the successful completion of the first enantioselective total synthesis of any bisabosqual with a 16&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;bisabosqual F. Key aspects include enantioselective N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed (4&#160;+&#160;2) annulation to construct the D&#8208;ring; stereoinvertive cyclization at a tertiary alcohol to produce the benzochromene; and late stage oxidative NHC&#8208;mediated lactonization to assemble the pentasubstituted aromatic.








Abstract
In 2001, a family of meroterpenoids, the bisabosquals, were isolated from the Stachybotrys fungi during studies focused on the discovery of antifungals. Although they share biosynthetic precursors with more common Stachbotrys merotepenoids, their cyclization is reminiscent of the cannabinoid family thereby providing their unique densely functionalized benzopyran/benzofuran core. Despite interest in their total synthesis, to date only racemic bisabosqual A has been prepared, with the enantioselective total synthesis of any bisabosqual yet to be realized. Herein, we report the successful completion of the first enantioselective total synthesis of a bisabosqual with the 16&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;bisabosqual F. Key aspects include an enantioselective N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed (4&#160;+&#160;2) annulation to construct the D&#8208;ring; stereoinvertive cyclization at a tertiary alcohol to produce an advanced benzochromene; and late stage oxidative NHC&#8208;mediated lactonization to assemble the pentasubstituted aromatic.

         <title>Additive Luminescence Lifetime Tuning of Upconversion Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Capacity Optical Encoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet powerful strategy has been developed to tune the luminescence lifetime of upconversion nanoparticles. This strategy can generate luminescence lifetimes, namely additive lifetimes, predictably, continuously, and facilely over a broad spectrum by mixing upconversion nanoparticles with different luminescence lifetimes, which can enable multidimensional encoding with high capacity.








Abstract
The tunable upconversion luminescence lifetime of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanomaterials offers great potential for stable and precise optical encoding in the temporal domain. However, typical methods for tuning upconversion luminescence lifetime, which depend on material synthesis, often suffer from inefficiency and unpredictability, hindering the application of upconversion luminescence lifetime. Here, using lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a representative, we demonstrate an additive strategy, akin to additive color mixing, to tune upconversion luminescence lifetime in a predictable and facile way. This strategy can easily generate a set of lifetimes using only two types of UCNPs, and the manipulated lifetimes can be quantitatively predicted according to the luminescence of the original UCNPs. Moreover, this strategy is applicable to lifetimes of lanthanide luminescence over a broad spectral range. Benefiting from this strategy, high&#8208;capacity encoding systems can be directly established by employing just a few types of UCNPs. These results should pave new ways for luminescence lifetime tuning and provide new opportunities for luminescence lifetime&#8208;based massive information storage and analysis.

         <title>Stabilizing Intrinsic Phase of Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 by Organic Molten&#8208;Salt Molecular Bridges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic molten&#8208;salt molecular bridge strategy based on formamidinium trifluoroacetate (FATFA) is developed to stabilize phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Bidirectional interfacial coordination effectively passivates defects, reconstructs crystallization pathways, suppresses lattice strain, and enhances charge extraction. Consequently, the perovskite solar cells deliver efficiencies of 25.14% for 0.05 cm2 devices and 22.11% for 12.6 cm2 mini&#8208;modules.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;pure formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is a highly promising absorber for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) but suffers from intrinsic phase instability. Here, we report a buried interface molecular bridge using formamidinium trifluoroacetate (FATFA) to stabilize the phase of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3. The TFA&#8722; anion affords bidirectional coordination: the carbonyl oxygen passivates oxygen vacancies in SnO2 while the &#8211;CF3 terminus lowers the surface energy of the perovskite (100) facet. Moreover, the octahedral distortion was significantly suppressed by the coordination between TFA&#8722; and [PbI6]&#8308;&#8722; octahedra, which strengthens the buried interface and establishes an ordered nucleation template that guides periodic lattice assembly. These coupled effects reconstruct the crystallization pathway, alleviate residual strain, and suppress defect formation. Devices incorporating FATFA achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.14% and retain 85% of their initial efficiency after 1,000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Tyrosine ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H Alkenylation for Macrocyclic Peptide SuFEx Proximity Labeling and Targeted Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed, directing&#8208;group&#8208;free ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H alkenylation of tyrosine was developed for late&#8208;stage peptide macrocyclization and SuFEx&#8208;based labeling. The resulting macrocycles, which integrate structural rigidity and covalent reactivity within a single scaffold, were applied to the design of CCP&#8208;TAC for targeted degradation of extracellular proteins. This work establishes tyrosine&#8208;directed C&#9472;H macrocyclization as a versatile platform for multifunctional cyclic peptides.








Abstract
Cyclic peptides hold great promise in drug discovery due to their conformational stability, proteolytic resistance, and ability to disrupt protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). However, their therapeutic potential is often constrained by reversible binding, while covalent labeling strategies such as Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) have largely been limited to linear scaffolds. Here, we report a late&#8208;stage Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H alkenylation of tyrosine that achieves directing&#8208;group&#8208;free late&#8208;stage peptide macrocyclization. This strategy preserves the phenolic side chain, which can subsequently be converted into an arylfluorosulfate for SuFEx&#8208;driven covalent labeling. The dual functionality of tyrosine thus enables the construction of macrocyclic scaffolds with enhanced conformational rigidity, intrinsic fluorescence, and covalent reactivity. As proof of concept, we synthesized a cyclic GnRH analogue (c&#8208;leuprolide) that exhibits superior antiproliferative activity compared with its linear counterpart. We further developed a covalent cyclic peptide&#8208;lysosome targeting chimera (CCP&#8208;TAC) that selectively degrades PD&#8208;L1, remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, and exhibits favorable biosafety in vivo. Together, these findings establish tyrosine&#8208;directed C&#9472;H functionalization as a versatile platform for multifunctional cyclic peptides, bridging synthetic methodology with therapeutic application and advancing peptide stapling, covalent labeling, and degrader technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A Pd(II)-catalyzed, directing-group-free ortho-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H alkenylation of tyrosine was developed for late-stage peptide macrocyclization and SuFEx-based labeling. The resulting macrocycles, which integrate structural rigidity and covalent reactivity within a single scaffold, were applied to the design of CCP-TAC for targeted degradation of extracellular proteins. This work establishes tyrosine-directed C&#9472;H macrocyclization as a versatile platform for multifunctional cyclic peptides.

         <title>Molecular Integration Strategy Enables Simultaneous Modulation of Crystal Growth and Interfacial Energy Loss for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>

Molecular&#8208;integrated PDA(AcSH)2 enables field&#8208;effect passivation via PDA2+ at the perovskite/C60 interface, while AcSH&#8211; mediates crystal growth and trap passivation. Reducible &#9472;SH in AcSH&#8211; converts I2/I3&#8211; to I&#8211;, forming reversible S&#9472;S dimers for self&#8208;healing and stability. The device achieves 26.88% efficiency (certified 26.4%) with a minimal non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of only 64 mV.








Abstract
Severe interfacial energy loss and inferior crystal quality remain key limitations for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a multifunctional molecule, 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dimercaptoacetate (PDA(AcSH)2), designed through a molecular&#8208;integration strategy to address these challenges simultaneously. The PDA2+ cations preferentially accumulate at the perovskite/C60 interface, establishing a field&#8208;effect passivation that suppresses interfacial contact induced non&#8208;radiative recombination. Meanwhile, the AcSH&#8211; anions are homogeneously distributed throughout the perovskite layer, mediating crystal growth and passivating charged traps via dual binding of &#9472;SH and &#9472;COO&#8211; groups. The reducible &#9472;SH groups in AcSH&#8211; also convert photo&#8208;thermally generated I2/I3&#8211; species into I&#8211;, forming reversible S&#9472;S dimers that photodecompose under UV light illumination to regenerate &#9472;SH groups. This enables a self&#8208;sustaining redox cycle for dynamic defect healing and enhances both precursor and film stability. Consequently, the optimized small&#8208;area (0.09&#8208;cm2) device achieves impressive efficiency of 26.88% and a non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of only 64&#160;mV. The strategy is readily scalable, delivering efficiencies of 24.92% and 22.73% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 12.96&#8208;cm2 mini&#8208;module, respectively. This work highlights the effectiveness of rational molecular design in mitigating both bulk and interfacial energy losses, paving the way for the next generation of high&#8208;performance, stable, and scalable PSCs.

         <title>A Photoelectrocatalytic Platform for Sequence&#8208;Unrestricted Modification of Oligonucleotide Backbones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical strategy enables sequence&#8208;unrestricted alkyl modification of oligonucleotide backbones. Alkyl radicals generated from simple carboxylic acids under mild conditions allow direct installation of diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups compatible with all canonical nucleobases. The resulting alkylphosphonate building blocks are incorporated into oligonucleotides by automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis, enhancing nuclease resistance and improving antisense anti&#8208;leukemic activity in cellular and patient&#8208;derived models.








Abstract
Oligonucleotide&#8208;based therapeutics represent a transformative modality for treating genetic disorders, yet their clinical translation is often hindered by poor nuclease stability, limited cellular uptake, and sequence&#8208;dependent toxicity. Chemical modification of the phosphodiester backbone is a central strategy to address these challenges. Among these, charge&#8208;neutral alkyl phosphonate analogues featuring P&#9472;C linkages have attracted considerable attention for their potential to enhance stability and safety. However, general and programmable methods for site&#8208;specific installation of diverse alkyl groups at the nonbridging oxygen position remain scarce, particularly for sterically demanding secondary and tertiary motifs. Herein, we report a modular photoelectrochemical strategy for direct alkyl modification of oligonucleotide backbones via radical&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#9472;P bond formation. This method harnesses the synergistic interplay of photoredox and electrochemical activation to generate alkyl radicals from simple carboxylic acids under mild conditions, thereby bypassing the need for highly reactive Grignard reagents or carbocation intermediates. The protocol accommodates a broad range of alkyl groups and is compatible with all canonical nucleobases, enabling sequence&#8208;unrestricted diversification. The resulting alkylphosphonate dimers were transformed into phosphoramidite monomers and incorporated into oligonucleotides by automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Biophysical and biochemical studies showed that these modifications preserve duplex hybridization while enhancing nuclease resistance. Notably, incorporation into the antisense drug Prexigebersen significantly enhanced anti&#8208;leukemic efficacy in cellular and primary patient&#8208;derived models, underscoring the translational potential of this strategy for next&#8208;generation nucleic acid therapeutics.

A kind of two&#8208;dimensional Cu3&#8208;based mental organic frameworks ultrathin nanosheets (i.e., 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt NSs)) in micrometer&#8208;scale has been prepared through the pendant group design of ligands with side chain induction effect and successfully applied in efficient photo&#8208;thermal catalysis.








Abstract
Attempts that can fabricate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into large&#8208;scale nanosheets with high crystallinity and multi&#8208;functions are much desired for their extended applications. Here, through the pendant group design of ligands, we have successfully prepared a kind of two&#8208;dimensional MOFs (i.e., 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt)) and a contrast three&#8208;dimensional Cu3&#8208;based MOFs (i.e., 3D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;H)) via different side chain induction effects. Interestingly, 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) can be easily exfoliated into micrometer&#8208;scale nanosheets (i.e., 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) NSs), while 3D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;H) is hard to exfoliate under similar conditions. Notably, the obtained 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) NSs possesses high crystallinity, porous structure, ultrathin thickness (&#8764;1.3&#160;nm) and abundant functional units that can be successfully applied in photo&#8208;thermal catalysis, demonstrating much better performance than 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) and 3D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;H). The structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships and possible mechanisms have been revealed by various characterizations coupled with theoretical calculations. These findings offer key understanding of molecular assembly in fabrication of MOFs into large&#8208;scale nanosheets for efficient photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Modulated Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Network Crosslinking in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate metal&#8208;dependent regulation of reactive oxygen species generation in porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages, enabling selective photooxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene. Secondary coordination between porphyrin metal centers and poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) allows these metallacages to act as crosslinkers, converting homogeneous photocatalysts into robust heterogeneous supramolecular networks with enhanced stability and recyclability. 








Abstract
Precise control over the photocatalytic selectivity by single atoms is ubiquitous in natural systems but remains a formidable challenge for artificial photocatalysts. Here, we present a series of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages with nearly identical architectures that differ only in the central metal atoms (Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) of the porphyrin ligands. The distinct d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of these metal centers governs ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, resulting in divergent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation pathways. The Co&#8211;porphyrin cage promotes electron transfer to produce superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;), whereas the Zn&#8211;porphyrin cage favors energy transfer to generate singlet oxygen (1O2); Ni&#8208; and Cu&#8208;porphyrin cages exhibit dual behavior. These variations lead to distinct oxidation selectivity of &#945;&#8208;terpinene, yielding either p&#8208;cymene (via O2&#8226;&#8722;) or ascaridole (via 1O2). Moreover, secondary coordination between the porphyrin metals and poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) affords robust supramolecular networks for heterogeneous catalysis with enhanced stability and recyclability. This study establishes single&#8208;atom modulation within metallacage frameworks as an effective strategy to control ROS generation and photocatalytic selectivity, paving the way toward the practical applications of metallacage&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Unlocking Dual&#8208;Pathway Low&#8208;Potential Aldehyde Oxidation on Chromium&#8208;Doped Copper Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;valent Cu&#8208;based nanowire arrays with Cr doping (An&#8208;CrCuxO&#8208;AC NWAs) is prepared as low&#8208;potential aldehyde oxidation reaction (LPAOR) catalyst. Doped Cr atoms induce interfacial OH&#8722; enrichment triggering a parallel one&#8208;electron and two&#8208;electron pathways in LPAOR. Owing to the adsorption capacity of substrates and kinetics energy barrier of elementary step are optimized by Cr doping, enabling LPAOR performance heightened.








Abstract
The low&#8208;potential aldehyde oxidation reaction (LPAOR) is emerging as a pivotal anodic strategy in hybrid water electrolysis and biomass fuel cell systems, enabling low&#8208;energy hydrogen production and biomass upgrading. However, the most prior research focus on the stability of monometallic Cu catalysts and the structural modulation to accelerate hydrogen coupling, without elucidating the entire reaction pathways. Herein, a Cr&#8208;doped mixed&#8208;valent Cu nanowire arrays (An&#8208;CrCuxO&#8208;AC NWAs) catalyst is prepared to elucidate the dual pathways in LPAOR. Owing to the regulation of Cr on the adsorption ability of OH*, the active H* generated by C&#9472;H bond cleavage of aldehyde group combines with OH* forming H2O via Volmer step, triggering parallel one&#8208;electron and two&#8208;electron reaction pathways for An&#8208;CrCuxO&#8208;AC NWAs catalyst. Furthermore, Cr incorporation tunes the electronic structure of Cu, modulating the adsorption capacity of substrates and kinetics energy barrier of key elementary step, which makes an enhanced LPAOR performance. Concretely, the An&#8208;CrCuxO&#8208;AC NWAs catalyst attains a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.224 VRHE, remarkably surpassing An&#8208;CuxO&#8208;AC NWAs catalyst (0.271 VRHE). A hybrid system coupled LPAOR with oxygen reduction reaction realizes a peak power density of 43.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 103.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 using An&#8208;CrCuxO&#8208;AC NWAs as anodic catalyst.

         <title>Metallopolymer Films of a Manganese(II) Chelate with Hexadentate Ligand for High&#8208;Performance Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electropolymerized film of an exceptionally stable Mn(II) chelate with a hexadentate N ligand was elaborately designed to fabricate solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, achieving double coloring (brown&#8208;yellow and blue) state, coloring/bleaching cycle within a few seconds, electrochromic efficiency over 335 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1, and cycling durability up to 10 000 cycles.








Abstract
To achieve high&#8208;performance electrochromism, one of the most critical challenge is how to attain a transparent state. For this purpose, we elaborately designed a diethylenetriamine&#8208;derived hexadentate nitrogen chelator functionalized with triphenylamine groups, which coordinates with manganese(II) ion to form an octahedral manganese(II) chelate. As d&#8211;d transition of the half&#8208;filled d5 manganese(II) center is forbidden, this manganese(II) chelate is colorless. Through electropolymerization of triphenylamine groups, we successfully fabricated a transparent metallopolymer film with manganese(II) chelates as repeating units. Under applied potentials, the initially transparent metallopolymer film undergoes stepwise oxidation at both manganese(II) and triphenylamine centers, so that the colorless film turns brown&#8208;yellow at 0.9&#160;V and further blue at 1.3&#160;V. The solid&#8208;state electrochromic device exhibits tricolor electrochromism from colorless to brownish yellow and blue at the voltages of 1.7 and 2.4&#160;V, respectively. The coloring/bleaching time, color contrast, and electrochromic efficiency are&#160;1.4&#160;s/0.4&#160;s, 40%, and 337.5 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1 between colorless and brownish yellow, whereas they become&#160;2.2&#160;s/0.4&#160;s, 73%, and 397.1 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1 between colorless and blue. The device exhibits excellent stability with up to 10 000 cycles for manganese&#8208;based electrochromism.

         <title>In Cellulo Multistep Synthesis of Antitumor Zwitterionic Heterocycles Triggered by Cancer&#8208;Specific Acrolein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of zwitterionic heterocycles directly within malignant cells is achieved using a nontoxic, non&#8208;ionic, and membrane&#8208;permeable precursor, which is activated by the oncometabolite acrolein. This cancer&#8208;specific in cellulo synthesis initiates a 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization cascade, yielding potent zwitterionic heterocycles that effectively eradicate cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. The approach addresses significant challenges related to permeability and off&#8208;target toxicity.








Abstract
Zwitterionic heterocycles hold significant therapeutic potential; however, their application is often hindered by poor membrane permeability and limited target&#8208;cell selectivity. Here, we report an innovative strategy for the in situ synthesis of these compounds within cancer cells, using a rationally designed precursor that is nontoxic, non&#8208;ionic, and membrane permeable. The synthesis is initiated by endogenous acrolein, an oncometabolite elevated in cancer cells, which triggers a cascade involving 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, diazo formation, carbamate cleavage, imine formation, intramolecular 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization, oxidative aromatization, and ester hydrolysis. We validated this methodology in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells, where the in situ&#8208;synthesized zwitterionic heterocycle exhibited anticancer activity. Conversely, its pre&#8208;synthesized congener showed minimal cytotoxicity, underscoring the poor membrane permeability of the zwitterionic form. Precursor optimization resulted in a lead compound that, upon administration to A549 cells, converted into a cytotoxic zwitterionic heterocycle with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6.2 &#181;M. The lead precursor showed exceptional selectivity, with no cytotoxicity in normal human diploid (TIG3) cells. This selectivity arises because healthy cells contain low acrolein levels, insufficient to trigger the activation cascade. Our approach effectively addresses the key therapeutic challenges associated with zwitterionic heterocycles.

         <title>A General Reverse Micelle&#8208;Confined Strategy for the Facile Synthesis of 2D Conjugated MOF Colloids with Good Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer a reverse micelle&#8208;confined strategy for facile and scale&#8208;up synthesis of 2D conjugated MOF colloids. Considering the broad light absorption and excellent stability, Cu&#8208;HHTP colloids achieve a photothermal conversion efficiency of 80.3% and enable nearly 100% conversion of CEES into non&#8208;toxic sulfoxide under visible light. This work enables the applications of 2D c&#8208;MOF colloids in catalysis and beyond. 








Abstract
Micelle&#8208;confined synthesis is a well&#8208;established bottom&#8208;up strategy for nanomaterials synthesis, offering precise synthetic control and inherent dispersibility in solution. Herein, we pioneer a reverse micelle&#8208;confined growth strategy for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) colloids, including Cu/Zn/Mn&#8208;HHTP. And scalable synthesis under mild conditions is also achieved. The confined space of micelle microenvironment effectively regulates the growth kinetics and stacking morphology, yielding nanoscale 2D c&#8208;MOFs in minutes that form stable colloids in various solvents for over 20 days. Considering the efficient visible&#8208;near infrared absorption in addition to the strong light&#8208;matter interactions of the 2D c&#8208;MOF colloids, an exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency of 80.3% is achieved under 880&#160;nm laser irradiation, which outperforms most other 2D photothermal materials. Leveraging this, the material served as an efficient catalyst toward the selective oxidation of a chemical warfare agent simulant (i.e., 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, CEES) under visible light, reaching near 100% yield to non&#8208;toxic sulfoxide with extremely low 2D c&#8208;MOFs usage. Our work highlights that micelle&#8208;confined synthesis serves as an efficient, energy&#8208;saving, and green strategy for fabricating 2D c&#8208;MOF colloids, paving the way for their applications in catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Regulated Orbital Coupling Enables Nucleophilic Carbon Assembly Pathways in Electrochemical CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn SACs&#9472;Cu2O hybrid catalyst enables selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion by stabilizing key *OCHO&#9472;CHO intermediates and promoting nucleophilic C&#9472;C coupling at the Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Cu interface, achieving high ethanol efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. 








Abstract
Achieving selective and durable CO2 electroreduction to ethanol remains challenging due to the instability of Cu oxidation states and inefficient C&#9472;C coupling. Here, we construct a Zn single&#8208;atom&#8208;Cu2O hybrid catalyst, where atomically dispersed Zn atoms form a well&#8208;defined ZnO&#9472;Cu interface. The catalyst delivers a high ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 74.4% and operates stably for 200&#160;h. Density functional theory and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that an intrinsic orbital coupling between Zn4&#160;s/4p and O 2p orbitals induces interfacial polarization. Under reaction conditions, this polarization stabilizes low&#8208;coordinated Cu&#8314; sites and facilitates *CHO formation. This polarization enables a nucleophilic C&#9472;C coupling pathway that bypasses *CO dimerization, reducing the kinetic barrier for ethanol formation. The concept of interfacial orbital regulation demonstrated here provides a general strategy for steering multi&#8208;electron reactions and C&#9472;X bond formation in electrochemical carbon valorization.

         <title>Primitive Ligands Drive 1D CsPbI3 Nanostructures with Strongly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustration highlights I&#8722; concentration drives the structural evolution of CsPbI3 from cubic to orthorhombic phase, accompanied by octahedral distortion. In addition, increasing I&#8722; transforms nanorods into ginkgo&#8208;leaf&#8208;like assemblies, including a 659&#8211;683&#160;nm PL redshift due to bandgap narrowing and strain effects. These findings demonstrate precise phase and morphology control for tailored optoelectronic properties in perovskite nanostructures.








Abstract
Despite growing research efforts on inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, the mechanistic understanding of nucleation and growth kinetics remains insufficient for achieving precise morphology and crystal structure control. Herein, by simply modulating the concentrations of primitive ligands (e.g., I&#8722; and oleylamine) into conventional synthetic strategies, CsPbI3 perovskites, ranging from zero&#8208;dimensional quantum dots to unique one&#8208;dimensional nanowires/nanorods and ginkgo leaf&#8208;like architectures, can be realized. Mechanistic studies suggests that capping agents compete for adsorption on specific crystal facets, a finding further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Simultaneously, the crystal structures of the products undergo a phase transition from cubic to orthorhombic symmetry driven by lattice distortion that disrupts the crystal symmetry. In addition, temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence studies revealed that the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strengths of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons (&#947;LO = 73.14 meV and ELO(&#8463;&#969;LO)${E_{LO}}\;( {\hbar {\omega _{LO}}} )$ =&#160;28.74 meV) of CsPbI3 nanorods were much lower (&#947;LO = 103.25 meV and ELO = 33.62 meV) than those of ginkgo leaf&#8208;like CsPbI3 superstructures, limiting multi&#8208;phonon&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative pathways. As a result, CsPbI3 nanorods display a strong polarization dependence with a polarization degree of up to &#8764;0.49. These results not only demonstrates novel perovskite nanocrystals but also provide a versatile platform for tailoring perovskite NCs with combined morphological diversity and tunable optical properties.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Island&#8208;Sea Structured Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Enables Cascade Defluorination of PFAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;island&#8208;sea&#8221; structured Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis system is designed by embedding atomically dispersed Cu&#9472;N4 islands within a piezoelectric PVDF matrix. This architecture enables directional electron transfer from the polymer sea to the catalytic islands, driven by a robust interfacial electric field. The resulting localized charge accumulation facilitates efficient oxygen activation and promotes the cascade defluorination of persistent PFAS under ultrasonic excitation.








Abstract
The exceptional stability of C&#9472;F bonds in per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) impedes their activation and degradation through conventional redox processes. Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) offers an oxidant&#8208;free alternative but suffers from uncontrolled electronic structures and non&#8208;directional electron transfer. Here, we design an &#8220;island&#8211;sea&#8221; structured CEC system by embedding atomically dispersed Cu&#9472;N4 islands within a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix. The Cu&#9472;N4 domains trigger interfacial electron transfer that induces &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization of PVDF. The aligned dipoles amplify piezoelectric polarization and strengthen interfacial electric fields (IEFs). This configuration enables efficient electron harvesting from interfacial water and field&#8208;emission&#8208;driven injection into Cu&#9472;N4 sites. The electron&#8208;enriched Cu sites activate O2 to form &#8226;O2&#8722; for nucleophilic defluorination while simultaneously populating the C&#9472;F &#963;* orbitals to facilitate bond cleavage. In parallel, &#8226;OH and 1O2 promote oxidative mineralization of low&#8208;fluorinated intermediates, establishing a cascade redox pathway. This cooperative mechanism achieves 95% degradation and 94.4% defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid with excellent stability. This study defines &#946;&#8208;phase&#8208;mediated IEF engineering in polymer/single&#8208;atom hybrids as a general concept for directing interfacial electron dynamics in catalytic systems.

This study defines &#946;-phase-mediated IEF engineering in polymer/single-atom hybrids as a general concept for directing interfacial electron dynamics in catalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Simultaneous Strengthening and Toughening of Cellulosic Triboelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a hydrogen bond dynamic pre&#8208;crosslinking network and Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced aggregation/crystallization to form a crystal domain network, the strength, toughness and triboelectricity of the cellulosic triboelectric material used in wearable electronic products can be simultaneously enhanced






.

Abstract
Flexible film materials often experience a decline in toughness while pursuing high strength. This challenge of balancing strength and toughness restricts their application in fields such as tissue engineering, soft robotics, and wearable electronic products. Inspired by the multilevel structures of natural materials, this study proposes a hydrogen&#8208;bond network restructuring strategy based on &#8220;multilevel crosslinking&#8221; to simultaneously enhance the tensile strength and toughness of cellulosic triboelectric films. During the reconstruction of the hydrogen bonding network, MXene nanosheets first form a dynamically pre&#8208;crosslinked network with polymer chains via hydrogen bonds. Subsequently, the Hofmeister effect enhances hydrogen bond interactions, inducing aggregation/crystallization to build domain networks and establish a multi&#8208;level crosslinked structure. This yields flexible cellulosic triboelectric films with enhanced strength and toughness, capable of withstanding loads exceeding 22,700 times their own weight. Simultaneously, the aggregation/crystallization of molecular chains induces rearrangement of surface functional groups, thereby altering surface potential and enhancing the material's electron&#8208;donating capacity, ultimately improving the triboelectric properties. This strategy offers novel insights for designing and fabricating high&#8208;performance flexible films required in next&#8208;generation flexible electronic devices, wearable technology, and related fields.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Selection by Mutational Profiling for Covalent RNA Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mutational profiling approach an RNA&#8208;targeted covalent probe was developed that is highly selective for the FMN riboswitch. The covalency was further supported by mass spectrometry experiments. The covalent probe selectively modifies the riboswitch at low micromolar concentrations within 10 min and remains functional when applied to an entire transcriptome.








Abstract
To facilitate the design of RNA&#8208;targeted covalent probes we report a bottom&#8208;up, structure&#8208;informed approach using mutational profiling. We designed a compact library of covalent probes based on the scaffold of Ribocil, a selective inhibitor targeting the bacterial FMN riboswitch and screened them against the FMN riboswitch aptamer from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. This yielded Covacil, a highly base&#8208;selective probe that covalently modifies the FMN riboswitch aptamer at low micromolar concentrations, within 10 minutes. We validate the site&#8208;selectivity and covalency of the probe by competitive photo&#8208;affinity labelling and mass&#8208;spectrometry. When compared to non&#8208;targeted covalent probes, Covacil displayed&#160;&gt;1,000&#8208;fold increased selectivity toward a specific base within the FMN riboswitch aptamer. Finally, we apply Covacil to total RNA and demonstrate that it maintains its base&#8208;selective reactivity for the FMN riboswitch within the entire transcriptome.

         <title>Mechanochemical Activation Switches the Chemoselectivity of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that using mechanochemistry in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling alters chemoselectivity from traditional C&#9472;C coupling to C&#9472;N coupling, achieving the solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable non&#8208;symmetric azobenzenes under ball milling. This simple and rapid method exhibits broad substrate compatibility and overcomes key synthetic challenges.








Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is considered as a crucial technique in the field of organic chemistry. Traditionally, the reaction between aryl diazonium salts and arylboronic acids in solution predominantly facilitates carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#9472;C) bond formation. However, our research reveals that mechanochemical techniques can shift the chemical selectivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, resulting in the generation of non&#8208;symmetric azobenzene compounds under neat milling conditions. Azobenzenes have progressed from being merely textile dyes to multifunctional molecular systems critical for advanced technologies; however, the synthetic challenges associated with non&#8208;symmetric azo derivatives remain significant. Here, we present an innovative methodology that eliminates the use of conventional solvents while demonstrating exceptional substrate compatibility and short reaction time under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations suggest that mechanochemical conditions alter the reaction pathway by selectively promoting carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) coupling.

         <title>Continuous Coupling Mechanism for High Rate Electrosynthesis of Urea on Sulfur&#8208;Coordinated Adjacent Copper Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work prepared a Cu&#8208;based coordination polymer with S&#8208;coordinated adjacent highly active Cu sites, which can promote C&#9472;N coupling and protonation, ultimately achieving ultra&#8208;high urea FE (84.9&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1%) and production rate (0.34&#160;&#177;&#160;0.012&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1).








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize urea can satisfy the comprehensive needs of carbon footprint closure, waste valorization, and sustainable urea production. However, designing efficient electrocatalysts to promote the electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling process and achieve efficient urea production remains a challenge. Here, we design a copper (Cu)&#8208;based coordination polymer catalyst, which can achieve the dual function of promoting C&#9472;N coupling and protonation through sulfur (S)&#8208;coordinated adjacent Cu sites. Through the unique Continuous Coupling Mechanism (CCM) of low Gibbs free energy of reaction intermediates (*CO2&#160;+&#160;*NO to *CO2NO to *ONCO2NO), the resulting catalyst achieved ultra&#8208;high Faradaic efficiency (FE) (84.9&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1%) and production rate (0.34&#160;&#177;&#160;0.012&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1). Moreover, the FE and production rate of urea did not change noticeably during at least 90 cycles of testing.

         <title>Seamlessly Overcoming Biological Barriers with a Small Photosensitizer to Treat Metastatic Tumors with Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 6, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
LUZ 51 is a relatively small and amphiphilic photosensitizer that accumulates in poorly&#8208;vascularized tumors, is rapidly internalized by cancer cells, does not elicit skin photosensitivity and triggers robust immunological responses that reduce spontaneous metastasis.








Abstract
A breakthrough in the treatment of solid tumors requires primary tumor ablation and remission of metastasis. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may meet these requirements, but current photosensitizers poorly infiltrate dense tumors and insufficiently stimulate the immune system. We introduce LUZ51, a small bacteriochlorin that features strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, high photostability, moderate lipophilicity, amphiphilicity, and appropriate singlet oxygen quantum yield. LUZ51 has a fast cellular uptake via passive diffusion and EC50s of 5&#8211;15&#160;nM range for a light dose of 1&#160;J/cm2. It seamlessly crosses biological barriers and accumulates in tumors. Mice with CT26 tumors cured in one treatment (0.15&#160;mg/kg and 20&#160;J/cm2) resisted tumor rechallenge. Treatment of mice with 5&#160;mm orthotopic 4T1 tumors enabled cures, with the associated inhibition of metastasis. The blood half&#8208;life is 82&#160;min and no skin photosensitivity was detected. Small&#8208;size LUZ51 enables tissue&#8208;agnostic PDT, with strong local and systemic effects.

&lt;p&gt;LUZ 51 is a relatively small and amphiphilic photosensitizer that accumulates in poorly-vascularized tumors, is rapidly internalized by cancer cells, does not elicit skin photosensitivity and triggers robust immunological responses that reduce spontaneous metastasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
