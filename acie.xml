         <title>Interconversion of Highly Entangled Polyhedra into Concave Polyhedra by Nitrate&#8208;Induced Ternary Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entangled (M3L2) n  polyhedral complexes represent a unique class of supramolecular architectures that are stabilized by relatively weak metal&#8211;acetylene interactions in cooperation with conventional metal&#8211;pyridyl coordination. Counter&#8208;anion exchange of these complexes with a nitrate (NO3&#8722;) ion triggered formal metal insertion between the metal centers, and a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode with acetylenic, pyridyl, and nitrate donors was generated on the metal centers. As a result, the main frameworks of the polyhedral complexes M18L12 and M12L8 were formally extended into a new series of concave polyhedra having the compositions M21L12 and M13L8, respectively. This transformation also resulted in the local disconnection of the highly entangled trifurcate topology of the framework, providing clues toward the skeletal editing of extended and complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Cation Interactions for Zero&#8208;Strain and High&#8208;Voltage P2&#8208;type Na2/3Li1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 Layered Oxide Cathodes of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep sodium extraction/insertion of sodium cathodes usually causes undesired Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and phase transition, both of which will reduce structural stability and lead to poor long&#8208;cycle reliability. Here we report a zero&#8208;strain P2&#8208; Na2/3Li1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 cathode, in which the lithium/cobalt substitution contributes to reinforcing the host structure by reducing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox, mitigating the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, and minimizing the lattice change. 94.5% of Na+ in the unit structure can be reversibly cycled with a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V (vs. Na+/Na). Impressively, a solid&#8208;solution reaction without phase transitions is realized upon deep sodium (de)intercalation, which poses a minimal volume deviation of 0.53%. It attains a high discharge capacity of 178 mAh g&#8722;1, a high energy density of 534 Wh kg&#8722;1, and excellent capacity retention of 95.8% at 1C after 250 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Atomic Fe&#8208;Spin State by Crystal Field and Magnetic Field for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly&#8208;active and low&#8208;cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution are essential in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries, and single atom catalysts with Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C are promising candidates. However, the activity still needs to be boosted, and the origination of spin&#8208;related oxygen catalytic performance is still uncertain. Herein, an effective strategy to regulate local spin state of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating crystal field and magnetic field is proposed. The spin state of atomic Fe can be regulated from low spin to intermediate spin and to high spin. The cavitation of dxz and dyz orbitals of high spin Fe(&#8546;) can optimize the O2 adsorption and promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*O2 to *OOH). Benefiting from these merits, the high spin Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst displays the highest oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the high spin Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;based rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery displays a high power density of 170 mW cm&#8208;2 and good stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Atom Migration Abilities Affected Anode Performance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) is commonly induced by irreversible phase conversion and difficult desodiation, especially on transition metal compounds (TMCs). Yet the underlying physicochemical mechanism of poor reaction reversibility is still a controversial issue. Herein, by using in situ transmission electron microscope and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, we demonstrate the irreversible conversion of NiCoP@C is caused by the rapid migration of P in carbon layer and preferential formation of isolated Na3P during discharge. By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized. The inhibiting of fast atom migration which induces component separation and rapid performance degradation might be applied to a wide range of electrode materials, and guides the development of advanced SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;enabled Quenching of Bacterial Communications for the Prevention of Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilm formation is a major threat to industry, the environment and human health. While killing of embedded microbes in biofilms may inevitably lead to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), catalytic quenching of bacterial communications by lactonase is a promising antifouling approach. Given the shortcomings of protein enzymes, it&#8217;s attractive to engineer synthetic materials to mimic the activity of lactonase. Herein, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Nx&#8208;C nanomaterial was synthesized by tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms to mimic the active domain of lactonase for catalytical interception of bacterial communications in biofilm formation. The Zn&#8208;Nx&#8208;C material could selectively catalyze 77.5% hydrolysis of N&#8208;acylated&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactone (AHL), a critical bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signal in biofilm construction. Consequently, AHL degradation downregulated the expression of QS&#8208;related genes in antibiotic resistant bacteria and significantly prevented biofilm formation. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8208;Nx&#8208;C&#8208;coated iron plates prevented 80.3% biofouling after a month exposure in river. Overall, our study provides a nano&#8208;enabled contactless antifouling insight to avoid AMR evolutions by engineering nanomaterials for mimicking the key bacterial enzymes (e.g., lactonase) functioning in biofilm construction.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;I&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Bromo(iodo)arenes with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite several methodologies established for C(sp2)&#8722;I selective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, achieving arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons by cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl precursors with bromo(iodo)arenes in a C(sp2)&#8722;I selective manner is rare. Here we report a general Ni&#8208;catalyzed C( sp2 )&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reaction, in which, beyond 3&#176; alkyl bromides (for constructing arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons), 2&#176; and 1&#176; alkyl bromides are also demonstrated to be viable coupling partners. Moreover, this mild XEC displays excellent C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and functional group compatibility. The practicality of this XEC is demonstrated in simplifying the routes to several medicinally relevant and synthetically challenging compounds. Extensive experiments show that the terpyridine&#8208;ligated NiI halide can exclusively activate alkyl bromides, forming a NiI&#8211;alkyl complex through a Zn reduction. Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8211;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Mediated Tumor Energy Remodeling for Sensitizing Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metabolic reprogramming of tumors requires ATP to maintain therapeutic resistance, posing a major challenge for photothermal therapy (PTT). Although raising the temperature can help in tumor ablation, it frequently leads to severe side effects such as chronic inflammation and hyper&#8208;immunogenicity. Therefore, improving therapeutic responsiveness and promoting wound healing are crucial considerations in PTT development. In this context, we proposed a gas&#8208;mediated energy remodeling strategy to enhance the efficacy of mild PTT at moderate temperatures while minimizing side effects. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an FDA&#8208;approved drug&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor was developed to provide a sustained supply of H2S to tumor sites, serving as an adjuvant to mild PTT. This approach proved to be highly effective in disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibiting ATP generation, and reducing the overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which ultimately amplified the therapeutic outcome. With the ability to reverse tumor thermotolerance, this strategy delivered a greatly potent antitumor response, achieving complete tumor ablation in a single treatment while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Thus, it holds great promise to overcome the limitations of PTT and may serve as a valuable paradigm for the future clinical translation of photothermal nanoplatforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Biomimetic Synthesis of Dimeric Tetrahydrocarbazoles via a Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization&#8211;[3+2] Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclodimerization (homochiral&#8208; and heterochiral&#8208;) of monomomeric units for the construction of stereodefined polycyclic systems is a powerful strategy in both biosynthesis and biomimetic synthesis. Herein we have discovered and developed a Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed, biomimetic, diastereoselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8211;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ol. This novel strategy operates under very mild conditions, providing access to structurally unprecedented dimeric tetrahydrocarbazoles fused to a tetrahydrofuran unit in excellent yields of the products. Several fruitful control experiments, isolation of the monomeric&#8208;cycloisomerized products and their subsequent conversion into the corresponding cyclodimeric products supported their intermediacy and the possible mechanism as a cycloisomerization&#8211;diastereoselective [3+2] cyclodimerization cascade. The cyclodimerization involves a substituent controlled, highly diastereoselective homochiral [3+2] annulation or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated 3&#8208;hydroxytetrahydrocarbazoles. The key and important features of this strategy are: a) construction of three new C&#8211;C bonds &amp; one new C&#8211;O bond; b) creation of three new stereocenters, and c) construction of three new rings, in a single operation; d) low catalyst loading (1&#8208;5 mol%); e) 100% atom economy; and f) rapid construction of structurally unprecedented natural product like polycyclic frameworks. A chiral pool version using an enantio&#8208; and diastereopure substrate was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezochromism in Dynamic Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials with pressure&#8208;dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies. Herein, we report two dynamic three&#8208;dimensional COFs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophores, termed JUC&#8208;635 and JUC&#8208;636 (JUC = Jilin University China), and for the first time, study their piezochromic behavior by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the various luminescent groups, JUC&#8208;635 has completely different solvatochromism and molecular aggregation behavior in the solvents. More importantly, JUC&#8208;635 with AIE effect exhibits a sustained fluorescence upon pressure increase (~3 GPa), and reversible sensitivity with high&#8208;contrast emission differences (&#916;&#955;em = 187 nm) up to 12 GPa, superior to other CPMs reported so far. Therefore, this study will open a new gate to expand the potential applications of COFs as exceptional piezochromic materials in pressure sensing, barcoding, and signal switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable Metal Azolate Frameworks Showing Interesting Flexibilities for Highly Effective Bioethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As demonstrated by the extraordinary ethanol purification performances of a pore&#8208;opening adsorbent for various ethanol/water mixtures, the guest&#8208;dominated gating process, in which the preferentially&#8208;adsorbed guest serves as the gating component, is critical for achieving ultrahigh adsorption selectivity in large&#8208;pore adsorbents and avoiding the co&#8208;adsorption problem of pore&#8208;opening adsorbents.







Abstract
The ethanol/water separation challenge highlights the adsorption capacity/selectivity trade&#8208;off problem. We show that the target guest can serve as a gating component of the host to block the undesired guest, giving molecular sieving effect for the adsorbent possessing large pores. Two hydrophilic/water&#8208;stable metal azolate frameworks were designed to compare the effects of gating and pore&#8208;opening flexibility. Large amounts (up to 28.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) of ethanol with fuel&#8208;grade (99.5&#8201;%+) and even higher purities (99.9999&#8201;%+) can be produced in a single adsorption process from not only 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 but also 10&#8201;:&#8201;90 ethanol/water mixtures. More interestingly, the pore&#8208;opening adsorbent possessing large pore apertures showed not only high water adsorption capacity but also exceptionally high water/ethanol selectivity characteristic of molecular sieving. Computational simulations demonstrated the critical role of guest&#8208;anchoring aperture for the guest&#8208;dominated gating process.

         <title>Sulfonium Salts as Acceptors in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes is a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radicals. Sulfonium salt acceptors promise to dramatically expand the range of radicals that can be generated and exploited using EDA chemistry; the use of readily installed &#8220;sulfonium tags&#8221; relaxes the electronic constraints typically imposed on the parent substrate by an EDA complexation approach.







Abstract
The photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexation, however, imposes electronic constraints on the donor and acceptor components and this can limit the range of radicals that can be generated using the approach. New EDA complexation strategies exploiting sulfonium salts allow radicals to be generated from native functionality. For example, aryl sulfonium salts, formed by the activation of arenes, can serve as the acceptor components in EDA complexes due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature. This &#8220;sulfonium tag&#8221; approach relaxes the electronic constraints on the parent substrate and dramatically expands the range of radicals that can be generated using EDA complexation. In this review, these new applications of sulfonium salts will be introduced and the areas of chemical space rendered accessible through this innovation will be highlighted.

Sulfonium salt acceptors promise to dramatically expand the range of radicals that can be generated and exploited using EDA chemistry; the use of readily installed &#8220;sulfonium tags&#8221; relaxes the electronic constraints typically imposed on the parent substrate by an EDA complexation approach.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photoactivation of electron donor-acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. Electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexation, however, imposes electronic constraints on the donor and acceptor components and this can limit the range of radicals that can be generated using the approach. New EDA complexation strategies exploiting sulfonium salts allow radicals to be generated from native functionality. For example, aryl sulfonium salts, formed by the activation of arenes, can serve as the acceptor components in EDA complexes due to their electron-deficient nature. This &#8220;sulfonium tag&#8221; approach relaxes the electronic constraints on the parent substrate and dramatically expands the range of radicals that can be generated using EDA complexation. In this review, these new applications of sulfonium salts will be introduced and the areas of chemical space rendered accessible through this innovation will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paired Oxidative and Reductive Catalysis: Breaking the Potential Barrier of Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired electrocatalysis strategy for alkane functionalization is reported for the first time, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. Importantly, C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of alkanes with ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential (&#8776;0.25&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) is achieved using this protocol, providing a modular method for versatile mono&#8208; or muti&#8208;substituted olefins under mild conditions.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsic inertness of alkanes, strong oxidative conditions are typically required to enable their C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, a paired electrocatalysis strategy was developed by integrating oxidative catalysis with reductive catalysis in one cell without interference, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. This approach lowers the previously high oxidation potential required for alkane activation, enabling electrochemical alkane functionalization at the ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential of &#8776;0.25&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl under mild conditions. Structurally diverse alkenes, including challenging all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted olefins, can be accessed using readily available alkenyl electrophiles.

         <title>Delayed Doublet Emission in a Cerium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a CeIII complex with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which is realized by a small positive energy gap &#916;ETD between the doublet (D1) and triplet (T1) excited states. The &#916;ETD is deduced to be 0.220&#8197;eV from the Arrhenius plot. The mechanism discovered enriches our understandings about the excited state relaxation process and may bring insights into rational energy level regulation of doublet emission.







Abstract
Doublet emission from open&#8208;shell molecules has demonstrated its research and application value in recent years. However, understandings of the photoluminescence mechanism of open&#8208;shell molecules are far less than that of closed&#8208;shell molecules, leading to challenges in molecular design of efficient doublet emission systems. Here we report a cerium(III) 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbozol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl&#8208;tris(pyrazolyl)borate complex Ce(CzPhTp)3 with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which also represents the first example with metal&#8208;centered delayed photoluminescence. The energy gap between the doublet and triplet excited states of Ce(CzPhTp)3 is reduced by the management of the inner and outer coordination spheres, thereby promoting efficient energy transfer between the two excited states and activating the delayed emission. The photoluminescence mechanism discovered may provide a new way for the design of efficient doublet emission and bring insights into rational molecular design and energy level regulation in open&#8208;shell molecules.

An extraction of &#8216;K2GeAs&#8217; in 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane/4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (en/crypt&#8208;222) affords As4&#8208;type pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral anions (Ge2As2)2&#8722;, (Ge3As)3&#8722;, and (GeAs3)&#8722;. On reaction with [MR2], up to four (Ge2As2)2&#8722; or (Ge3As)3&#8722; units can coordinate to M2+ ions (M=Zn, Cd, Hg) in [RZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722;, [PhHg(Ge3As)]2&#8722;, [(Ge3As)Zn(Ge2As2)]3&#8722;, [Cd3(Ge3As)3]3&#8722;, and [Zn3(Ge3As)4]6&#8722; (R=Ph, Mes). The anions apparently are related by a stepwise formation cascade.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral units of p&#8208;block atoms proved to be excellent building blocks for novel molecular architectures and for introducing new elemental combinations which are not otherwise accessible. In this work, we present a series of clusters obtained by reactions of binary Ge/As anions with [MPh2] (M=Zn, Cd, Hg; Ph=phenyl). The study is grounded on the fact that the binary reactant gained by extracting the solid &#8216;K2GeAs&#8217; with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (en) co&#8208;exists as (Ge2As2)2&#8722; and (Ge3As)3&#8722; in solution. This allows for a larger variety of products by &#8216;selecting&#8217; the most suitable species for the final ternary complex to crystallize. The reactions afforded the unprecedented first step of the corresponding interaction, thus attachment of (MPh)+ to a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral unit in [PhZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (1) and [PhHg(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (2), and complex anions with two, three, or four units, [(Ge3As)Zn(Ge2As2)]3&#8722; (3), [Cd3(Ge3As)3]3&#8722; (4), and [Zn3(Ge3As)4]6&#8722; (5). Quantum chemistry confirmed the compositions and the positions of the Ge or As atoms, beside explaining structural peculiarities. The subtle impact of different [MR2] reactants was additionally studied by corresponding reactions using [ZnMes2] (Mes=mesityl), which showed success in selectively crystallizing [MesZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (6). Based on our findings, we derive a suggestion of the underlying reaction cascade.

         <title>Carbon Deposit Analysis in Catalyst Deactivation, Regeneration, and Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article discusses the role of carbon species deposited from various feedstock molecules or formed over time during a catalytic process, including ways to mitigate the effects of these carbon species by catalyst design, regeneration or rejuvenation. This will be done for various industrially relevant systems, including the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. New tools for the direct observation of the 3D&#8208;distribution of carbon species within the catalyst pore network are also described.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suffer from deactivation by deposition or formation of carbon deposits. Carbon deposit formation is thermodynamically favored above 350&#8201;&#176;C, even in some hydrogen&#8208;rich environments. We discuss four basic mechanisms: a carbenium&#8208;ion based mechanism taking place on acid sites of zeolites or bifunctional catalysts, a metal&#8208;induced formation of soft coke (i.e., oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a radical&#8208;mediated mechanism in higher&#8208;temperature processes, and fast&#8208;growing carbon filament formation. Catalysts deactivate because carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re&#8208;used, others can be regenerated or have to be discarded. Catalyst and process design can mitigate the effects of deactivation. New analytical tools allow for the direct observation (in some cases even under in situ or operando conditions) of the 3D&#8208;distribution of coke&#8208;type species as a function of catalyst structure and lifetime.

&lt;p&gt;This review article discusses the role of carbon species deposited from various feedstock molecules or formed over time during a catalytic process, including ways to mitigate the effects of these carbon species by catalyst design, regeneration or rejuvenation. This will be done for various industrially relevant systems, including the methanol-to-hydrocarbons process. New tools for the direct observation of the 3D-distribution of carbon species within the catalyst pore network are also described.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suffer from deactivation by deposition or formation of carbon deposits. Carbon deposit formation is thermodynamically favored above 350&#8201;&#176;C, even in some hydrogen-rich environments. We discuss four basic mechanisms: a carbenium-ion based mechanism taking place on acid sites of zeolites or bifunctional catalysts, a metal-induced formation of soft coke (i.e., oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a radical-mediated mechanism in higher-temperature processes, and fast-growing carbon filament formation. Catalysts deactivate because carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re-used, others can be regenerated or have to be discarded. Catalyst and process design can mitigate the effects of deactivation. New analytical tools allow for the direct observation (in some cases even under in situ or operando conditions) of the 3D-distribution of coke-type species as a function of catalyst structure and lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Adhesives with Extended Tolerance to Extreme Conditions via Water&#8208;Modulated Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids and phenols has been demonstrated to be a general approach to develop new functional supramolecular adhesives capable of adapting to various extreme conditions in a controlled manner. Multiple noncovalent interactions in the two&#8208;component systems are balanced upon the participation of water, thereby expanding the tolerance range of the resulting adhesives to aqueous and ultracold environments.







Abstract
Development of supramolecular adhesives with strong tolerance to extreme conditions has emerged as an important research area. In this study, by balancing supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding interactions, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, we designed and prepared a series of two&#8208;component supramolecular adhesives derived from small organic molecules. Highly efficient interfacial adhesion with maximum adhesion strength of &#8776;10.0&#8197;MPa was realized on various surfaces in air, organic solvents, or liquid nitrogen. Owing to balanced supramolecular interactions, water participation prolonged and increased the tolerance of the adhesives in extreme environments. We demonstrate that the combination of imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids and phenols can be applied for various interfacial adhesions, thereby aiding the development of next&#8208;generation adhesives capable of adapting to various extreme conditions in a controlled manner.

         <title>Braided Fiber Current Collectors for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;channel fiber current collector with both high electrical conductivity and loading content of active materials has been designed to produce fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy densities.







Abstract
Fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising power strategy for the rising wearable electronics. However, most fiber current collectors are solid with vastly increased weights of inactive materials and sluggish charge transport, thus resulting in low energy densities which have hindered the development of fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries in the past decade. Here, a braided fiber current collector with multiple channels was prepared by multi&#8208;axial winding method to not only increase the mass fraction of active materials, but also to promote ion transport along fiber electrodes. In comparison to typical solid copper wires, the braided fiber current collector hosted 139&#8201;% graphite with only 1/3 mass. The fiber graphite anode with braided current collector delivered high specific capacity of 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the overall electrode weight, which was 2 times higher than that of its counterpart solid copper wire. The resulting fiber battery showed high energy density of 62&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Convergent Asymmetric Hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been developed, especially its convergent pattern for E/Z&#8208;substrates. Excellent enantioselectivity, wide substrate scope, and valuable applications were shown.







Abstract
Using the diphosphine&#8208;cobalt&#8208;zinc catalytic system, an efficient asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been realized. In particular, the Ph&#8208;BPE ligand can achieve convergent asymmetric hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;substrates. High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were obtained for both acyclic and cyclic enamides bearing &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl substituents. Hydrogenated products can be applied for the synthesis of useful chiral drugs such as Arfromoterol, Rotigotine, and Norsertraline. In addition, reasonable catalytic mechanism and stereocontrol mode are proposed based on DFT calculations.

         <title>Aqueous Processable Two&#8208;Dimensional Triazine Polymers with Superior Photocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general noncovalent functionalization strategy is developed to prepare aqueous processable high&#8208;quality semiconducting 2D triazine polymers on a large scale. The crystalline ultrathin 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight and mechanically strong aerogels and also exhibit superior photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Efficient and scalable production of high&#8208;quality and processable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers are highly desired but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient noncovalent functionalization strategy for producing highly uniform, aqueous processable and semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the aromatic amphiphilic 1&#8208;pyrenebutyrate can adsorb and intercalate into the interlayer of bulk crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF) through noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the pyrene moiety and the porous basal plane of 2D triazine polymer layer, which greatly facilitate the exfoliation of CTF in water in large scale. The as&#8208;prepared highly water&#8208;dispersible single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight aerogels with a density of 5&#8211;15&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3, which can be further shaped into mechanically strong films upon simple compression. This noncovalent functionalization not only improve the dispersibility and processability of 2D triazine polymer, but also optimize its band structure and promote the photogenerated carrier separation via an interesting surface molecule doping effect, thus resulting in a remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1249&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (24980&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 27.2&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for the 2D triazine polymer, outperforming most metal&#8208;free photocatalysts ever reported.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Like Particle&#8208;Induced cGAS&#8208;STING Activation and AIM2 Inflammasome&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a virus&#8208;like particle loaded with densely packed DNA and covered with cationic liposomes. It not only induces liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activates STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines, but it also triggers the formation of AIM2 inflammasome and induces gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis to boost antitumor immunity, thus realizing efficient immunotherapy and tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;mediated DNA sensing is demonstrated to be critical for launching antitumor immunity. However, DNA&#8208;based cGAS&#8208;STING agonists are rarely reported owing to low cell permeability, poor biostability and, especially, limited length of exogenous DNA. Here, we present a virus&#8208;like particle which is self&#8208;assembled from long DNA building blocks generated through rolling&#8208;circle amplification (RCA) and covered with cationic liposomes. Based on long and densely packed DNA structure, it could efficiently induce liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activate STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, this virus&#8208;like particle could also trigger the formation of AIM2 inflammasome to induce gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, boosting antitumor immunity. Thus, this study provides a simple and robust strategy for cancer immunotherapy for clinical application. This is the first study to report the intrinsic immunogenicity of RCA products, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cGAS-STING-mediated DNA sensing is demonstrated to be critical for launching antitumor immunity. However, DNA-based cGAS-STING agonists are rarely reported owing to low cell permeability, poor biostability and, especially, limited length of exogenous DNA. Here, we present a virus-like particle which is self-assembled from long DNA building blocks generated through rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and covered with cationic liposomes. Based on long and densely packed DNA structure, it could efficiently induce liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activate STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, this virus-like particle could also trigger the formation of AIM2 inflammasome to induce gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis, boosting antitumor immunity. Thus, this study provides a simple and robust strategy for cancer immunotherapy for clinical application. This is the first study to report the intrinsic immunogenicity of RCA products, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electroreductive Dicarboxylation of Unactivated Skipped Dienes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful electrochemical protocol that enables the first dicarboxylation of unactivated skipped dienes with CO2 is reported. Various valuable tethered adipic acids are formed in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields under mild conditions, showing great potential in synthetic, medicinal chemistry, and polymer chemistry.







Abstract
Carboxylation of easily available alkenes with CO2 is highly important to afford value&#8208;added carboxylic acids. Although dicarboxylation of activated alkenes, especially 1,3&#8208;dienes, has been widely investigated, the challenging dicarboxylation of unactivated 1,n&#8208;dienes (n&gt;3) with CO2 remains unexplored. Herein, we report the first dicarboxylation of unactivated skipped dienes with CO2 via electrochemistry, affording valuable dicarboxylic acids. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the single electron transfer (SET) reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which is followed by sluggish radical addition to unactivated alkenes, SET reduction of unstabilized alkyl radicals to carbanions and nucleophilic attack on CO2 to give desired products. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, facile derivations of products and promising application in polymer chemistry.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;, Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Fluoroallylation/Annulation of Hydrazones with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes via Tunable Palladium/NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd/NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselective fluoroallylation/annulation of hydrazones with gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is reported. This divergent defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling strategy is controlled by the nature of the hydrazones and the backbone of NHC ligands. It proceeds through either one&#8208;fold or two&#8208;fold C&#8722;F activation to afford N2 function&#8208;containing monofluoroalkenes or pyrazoles, respectively, in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Defluorinative manipulation of polyfluorinated molecules has shown great promise due to its granting of synthetic versatility to inert C&#8722;F bonds. The development of chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselective strategies to realize highly efficient formation of either the linear/branched or E/Z products from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes (gem&#8208;F2CPs) is a challenging task. Herein, we have realized palladium/NHC&#8208;catalyzed fluoroallylation/annulation of hydrazones with gem&#8208;F2CPs that incorporate the hydrazone N2 moiety into the products. The thermodynamically unstable fluorinated E&#8208;allylation products with aryl ketone hydrazones were obtained for the first time, while the di&#8208;alkyl ketone hydrazones yielded the monofluorinated products with branched selectivity under similar reaction conditions. With aldehyde hydrazones, two kinds of pyrazoles were obtained via a defluorinative allylation/annulation cascade, in which different carbon atoms of gem&#8208;F2CPs could be incorporated into the pyrazole rings regiospecifically. DFT calculations revealed that the divergent selectivity was kinetically controlled and the final C&#8722;C bond formation proceeded through a 7&#8208;membered TS.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Organoradical Boron Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct C&#8722;H borylation of the radical substrate via iridium catalysis was achieved for the first time, leading to air&#8208;stable organoradical boron reagent TTM&#8208;Bpin and derivatives, which can smoothly work in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction as a versatile building block for constructing useful open&#8208;shell molecules with retention of the carbon radical center.







Abstract
Both organic radicals and organoboron reagents have been broadly investigated, but the combination of them via direct C&#8722;H borylation as organic radical building blocks has never been achieved. Herein, a series of organoradical boron reagents, such as TTM&#8208;Bpin and TTM&#8208;BOH, were synthesized through the key step of C&#8722;H borylation of substrate TTM&#8208;H ((2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl) bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl) radical for the first time. They are air stable enough to be stored in the solid state for several months under dark conditions, and fully investigated through single crystal analysis, EPR and DFT calculations. Furthermore, they can smoothly work in the standard Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction with retention of the carbon radical center. Meanwhile, these radical species bearing different boron units display fluorescent character and are potentially applied for the collective synthesis of luminescent organic radicals, as well as other functionalized open&#8208;shell materials.

         <title>Practical Antibody Recruiting by Metabolic Labeling with Caged Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a glycan&#8208;display approach that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile method for editing cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting in the presence of their antibodies, demonstrating the practical utility of the caging strategy in glycocalyx editing.







Abstract
We propose a de novo glycan display approach that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile editing method for cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting. The caging strategy prevents the capture of &#945;&#8208;rhamnose (an antigen glycan) by endogenous antibodies during the introduction of the glycan to the targeted cell surface, and subsequent uncaging successfully induces immune responses. Therefore, this study proposes a practical method for editing the cell&#8208;surface glycocalyx under promiscuous conditions, such as those in vivo, which paves the way for the development of glycan function analysis and regulation.

         <title>A Tailored Versatile and Efficient NHC&#8208;Based NNC&#8208;Pincer Manganese Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Polar Unsaturated Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydride&#8208;transfer reactivity of Mn&#8208;hydride species has been greatly enhanced via rational design of a strong electron&#8208;donating and sterically unhindered NHC&#8208;based NNC&#8208;pincer ligand. This newly developed NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst is highly effective for the hydrogenation of a broad range of polar unsaturated compounds (&gt;80 examples) including esters, N&#8208;heteroarenes, amides, carbonates, and urea derivatives, under relatively mid conditions.







Abstract
The reactivity of metal&#8208;hydride complexes can be harnessed by the modification of ancillary ligands. With the aim of improving the hydride&#8208;donor ability of the key Mn&#8722;H intermediate and reducing steric hindrance, we herein report the rational design of a versatile and efficient NHC&#8208;based NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. This newly developed catalyst exhibited higher activity than the corresponding NNP&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst owing to its reduced steric hindrance and enhanced Mn&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bonding orbital energy level through a &#960;&#8208;antibonding interaction. Using this highly active NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst, a rich array of polar unsaturated compounds (&gt;80 examples) including esters, N&#8208;heteroarenes, amides, carbonates, and urea derivatives, were successfully hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions. This work represents a rare example of a general phosphine&#8208;free Mn&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation system.

This newly developed catalyst exhibited higher activity than the corresponding NNP-pincer Mn catalyst owing to its reduced steric hindrance and enhanced Mn&#8722;H &#963;-bonding orbital energy level through a &#960;-antibonding interaction. Using this highly active NNC-pincer Mn catalyst, a rich array of polar unsaturated compounds (&amp;gt;80 examples) including esters, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroarenes, amides, carbonates, and urea derivatives, were successfully hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions. This work represents a rare example of a general phosphine-free Mn-catalyzed hydrogenation system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;osmotic Power Generation from Bioinspired Anti&#8208;fouling 2D WS2 Composite Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Kevlar&#8208;toughened WS2 composite membrane was fabricated for osmotic energy conversion. Benefiting from the synergistic cooperation of photo&#8208;electronic and photo&#8208;thermal effects of WS2, the output power density of osmotic energy generator with this membrane could achieve 16.43&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under asymmetric irradiation.







Abstract
Nanofluidic reverse electrodialysis provides an attractive way to harvest osmotic energy. However, most attention was paid to monotonous membrane structure optimization to promote selective ion transport, while the role of external fields and relevant mechanisms are rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate a Kevlar&#8208;toughened tungsten disulfide (WS2) composite membrane with bioinspired serosa&#8208;mimetic structures as an efficient osmotic energy generator coupling light. As a result, the output power could be up to 16.43&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under irradiation, outperforming traditional two&#8208;dimensional (2D) membranes. Both the experiment and simulation uncover that the generated photothermal and photoelectronic effects could synergistically promote the confined ion transport process. In addition, this membrane also possesses great anti&#8208;fouling properties, endowing its practical application. This work paves new avenues for sustainable power generation by coupling solar energy.

         <title>Designing Breathing Air&#8208;electrode and Enhancing the Oxygen Electrocatalysis by Thermoelectric Effect for Efficient Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a new breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using P&#8208;type and N&#8208;type thermoelectrocatalysts as charge and discharge electrodes, respectively. Benefiting from the thermoelectric generated Seebeck voltages and carrier accumulation, the intrinsic oxygen catalytic activity was impressively enhanced. The breathing ZAB displayed a remarkable charge/discharge voltage gap and energy efficiency.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and mutual interference of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in the air electrode resulted in large charge/discharge overpotential and low energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, we designed a breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in the battery using P&#8208;type Ca3Co4O9 and N&#8208;type CaMnO3 as charge and discharge thermoelectrocatalysts, respectively. The Seebeck voltages generated from thermoelectric effect of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 synergistically compensated the charge and discharge overpotentials. The carrier migration and accumulation on the cold surface of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 optimized the electronic structure of metallic sites and thus enhanced their intrinsic catalytic activity. The oxygen evolution and reduction overpotentials were enhanced by 101 and 90&#8197;mV, respectively, at temperature gradient of 200&#8201;&#176;C. The breathing Zn&#8208;air battery displayed a remarkable energy efficiency of 68.1&#8201;%. This work provides an efficient avenue towards utilizing waste heat for improving the energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Toward Complete Transformation of Sodium Polysulfides by Regulating the Second&#8208;Shell Coordinating Environment of Atomically Dispersed Fe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed N, S&#8208;coordinated Fe catalysts are anchored into porous carbon nanofibers as hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The introduction of second&#8208;shell S atoms modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, thus enhancing the catalytic activity for promoting complete transformation of active S species, while realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na deposition.







Abstract
Room temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are highly competitive as potential energy storage devices. Nevertheless, their actually achieved reversible capacities are far below the theoretical value due to incomplete transformation of polysulfides. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N/S active center by regulating the second&#8208;shell coordinating environment of Fe single atom is proposed. The Fe&#8722;N4S2 coordination structure with enhanced local electronic concentration around the Fermi level is revealed via synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations, which can not only significantly promote the transformation kinetics of polysulfides, but induce uniform Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the obtained S cathode delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 1590&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly the theoretical value. This work opens up a new avenue to facilitate the complete transformation of polysulfides for RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization through Cationic Vacancy Defects in Bi4Ti3O12 for Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer mechanism of cation vacancies during molecular oxygen activation is discussed. Cationic vacancy defects can induce electron spin polarization, increase the number of spin&#8208;down photogenerated electrons, and reduce the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Molecular oxygen (O2) activation technology is of great significance in environmental purification due to its eco&#8208;friendly operation and cost&#8208;effective nature. However, the activation of O2 is limited by spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, and efficient molecular oxygen activation depends on electronic behavior and surface adsorption. Herein, we prepared cationic defect&#8208;rich Bi4Ti3O12 (BTO&#8208;MV2) catalysts containing Ti vacancies (VTi) for O2 activation in water purification. The VTi on BTO nanosheets can induce electron spin polarization, increasing the number of spin&#8208;down photogenerated electrons and reducing the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs. An active surface VTi is also formed, serving as a center for adsorbing O2 and extracting electrons, effectively generating &#8901;OH, O2&#8901;&#8722; and 1O2. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by BTO&#8208;MV2 is 3.3&#8197;times faster than BTO, indicating a satisfactory prospect for practical application. This work provides an efficient pathway to activate molecular oxygen by constructing new active sites through cationic vacancy modification technology.

         <title>Expanding Linker Dimensionality in Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks for sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Control for Separation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing linker dimensionality in metal&#8208;organic frameworks limits the effects of linker orientation and structural flexibility on pore size, ultimately enhancing the separation capabilities of these materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with high surface areas, which are acquiring rapid attention on an exponential basis. A significant characteristic of MOFs is their ability to act as adsorbents to selectively separate component mixtures of similar size, thereby addressing the technological need for an alternative approach to conventional distillation methods. Recently, MOFs comprising a 3&#8208;Dimensional (3D) linker have shown outstanding capabilities for difficult separations compared to the parent 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) analogue. 3D&#8208;linkers with a polycyclic core are underrepresented in the MOF database due to the widespread preferred use of 2D&#8208;linkers and the misconceived high&#8208;cost of 3D linkers. We summarize the recent research of 3D&#8208;linker MOFs and highlight their beneficial employment for selective gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation. Furthermore, we outline forecasts in this area to create a platform for widespread adoption of 3D&#8208;linkers in MOF synthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with high surface areas, which are acquiring rapid attention on an exponential basis. A significant characteristic of MOFs is their ability to act as adsorbents to selectively separate component mixtures of similar size, thereby addressing the technological need for an alternative approach to conventional distillation methods. Recently, MOFs comprising a 3-Dimensional (3D) linker have shown outstanding capabilities for difficult separations compared to the parent 2-Dimensional (2D) analogue. 3D-linkers with a polycyclic core are underrepresented in the MOF database due to the widespread preferred use of 2D-linkers and the misconceived high-cost of 3D linkers. We summarize the recent research of 3D-linker MOFs and highlight their beneficial employment for selective gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation. Furthermore, we outline forecasts in this area to create a platform for widespread adoption of 3D-linkers in MOF synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Continuous Evolution of Enzymatic Activity Screened at Ultrahigh Throughput Using Drop&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel nCAS9&#8208;mutagenic polymerase&#8208;based continuous evolution platform for improvement of enzymatic activity that functions at ultra&#8208;high throughput. By cycling cells between growth, mutagenesis, and microfluidics&#8208;based sorting, we mimic natural evolution but at a pace that is orders of magnitude faster, yielding an alditol oxidase variant with 10.5&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency for waste product, glycerol as a substrate.







Abstract
Enzymes are highly specific catalysts delivering improved drugs and greener industrial processes. Naturally occurring enzymes must typically be optimized which is often accomplished through directed evolution; however, this is still a labor&#8208; and capital&#8208;intensive process, due in part to multiple molecular biology steps including DNA extraction, in vitro library generation, transformation, and limited screening throughput. We present an effective and broadly applicable continuous evolution platform that enables controlled exploration of fitness landscape to evolve enzymes at ultrahigh throughput based on direct measurement of enzymatic activity. This drop&#8208;based microfluidics platform cycles cells between growth and mutagenesis followed by screening with minimal human intervention, relying on the nCas9 chimera with mutagenesis polymerase to produce in vivo gene diversification using sgRNAs tiled along the gene. We evolve alditol oxidase to change its substrate specificity towards glycerol, turning a waste product into a valuable feedstock. We identify a variant with a 10.5&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Supramolecular Copolymers Under Kinetic, Thermodynamic, or Pathway&#8208;Switching Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and kinetic pathways of IrIII complexes monomers has led to their block co&#8208;assembly through kinetic control and pathway&#8208;switching control, respectively. The well&#8208;defined block microstructure has been characterized by TEM and SEM images. The present research approach will be an important step forward in the study of the self&#8208;assembly of small molecules that can form crystalline assemblies.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities. However, the co&#8208;assembly strategies to construct co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules with well&#8208;defined sequence structures are still limited, especially for more complex crystalline block co&#8208;assemblies. Herein, we target this challenge by designing IrIII complexes 1 and 2, which possess unique self&#8208;assembly pathways and are capable of forming crystalline assemblies in aqueous systems. Specifically, block and random co&#8208;assemblies of 1 and 2 can be synthesized by kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. Meanwhile, by adjusting the water content to orthogonalize the on&#8208;pathway and the off&#8208;pathway, an unprecedented pathway&#8208;switching approach is realized to synthesize block and random co&#8208;assemblies. By coupling the kinetic pathways, the present co&#8208;assembly strategies are expected to pave the way for the synthesis of crystalline co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules and the construction of organic heterostructures.

         <title>[n]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Pillar[5]arene Bismacrocycles: Their Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Multiple Guest Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismacrocycles are presented. [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]As show multiple guest recognition and promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.02).







Abstract
Both pillar[n]arenes (P[n]As) and [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) play an important role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the precise synthesis of two multifunctional bismacrocycles [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A by integrating P[5]A into the [n]CPP backbone. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of the bismacrocycles was found to show a dramatic increase relative to the corresponding [n]CPPs. The chiral enantiomers (pR)/(pS)&#8208;[8]CPP&#8208;P[5]A were successfully isolated by chiral HPLC, and showed promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.02). In addition, [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A bismacrocycles are capable of binding pyridinium salts and fullerene derivatives with high affinity and specificity within the two distinct cavities. Transient absorption studies showed that photo&#8208;induced electron transfer occurs in [10]CPP&#8208;P[5]A&#8835;C60 complex. Our results suggest that [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A are potentially useful in CPL&#8208;active materials, multiple guest recognition and supramolecular polymer preparation.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Redox Chemistry of p&#8208;Type Poly(vinyldimethylphenazine) Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material containing 5,10&#8208;dimethyldihydrophenazine as active moieties is presented. Its electrochemical characterization discovered an anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry. Based on the optimized formula of cathode and electrolyte solution, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyldihydrophenazine) (PVDMP) cathode delivered high voltage, high capacity and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic electrode materials have attracted vast research attention owing to their designable structures and tunable electrochemical properties. Although n&#8208;type cathode materials could be used in various metal&#8208;ion batteries, p&#8208;type ones with high potential can deliver high energy density. Herein, we report a new p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine) (PVDMP), with a theoretical capacity of 227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. PVDMP featuring two&#8208;step redox reaction will be doped by two anions to maintain electroneutrality during oxidation, which resulted in an anion&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior of PVDMP&#8208;based cathode. The suitable dopant anion for PVDMP was selected and the doping mechanism was confirmed. Under the optimized condition, PVDMP cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and even remains 150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3900&#8197;cycles. This work not only provides a new kind of p&#8208;type organic cathode materials but also deepens the understanding of its anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic transformation of renewable plant oils including microalgae and waste oil into industrially relevant &#945;-olefins in the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; regime is demonstrated. The biorefinery concept is comprised of a catalytic sequence of ethenolysis, double bond isomerization, and a subsequent ethenolysis, thereby cutting and rearranging the fatty acid chains into valuable chemical building blocks. A benign extraction and reaction solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is utilized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mapping the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Gasoline Process Over Zeolite Beta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal and complementary spectroscopic strategy (involving operando UV/Visible spectroscopy coupled to online mass spectrometry and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) delivers a mechanistic blueprint of the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline process by elucidating the impact of carbonylated and oxymethylene species.







Abstract
Decarbonizing the transportation sector is among the biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. CO2&#8208;neutral fuels, such as those obtained from renewable methanol, have the potential to account for a large share of the solution, since these could be directly compatible with existing power trains. Although discovered in 1977, the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline (MTG) process has hardly reached industrial maturity, among other reasons, because maximizing the production of gasoline range hydrocarbons from methanol has proved complicated. In this work, we apply multimodal operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy coupled with an online mass spectrometer and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to better understand the reaction mechanism over zeolites H&#8208;Beta and Zn&#8208;Beta. Significantly, the influential co&#8208;catalytic role of oxymethylene species is linked to gasoline formation, which impacts the MTG process more than carbonylated species.

         <title>Insight into the Molecular Mechanism for Enhanced Longevity of Supramolecular Vesicular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study puts forward a new membrane&#8208;based heterogenization strategy to promote the stability of organic photocatalysts. The underlying mechanisms of enhanced longevity of supramolecular systems are disclosed at the molecular level. The as&#8208;prepared biomimetic photocatalysts display long&#8208;live exciton lifetime and fast &#8220;hot&#8221; electron relaxation, and work efficiently up to at least 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is a promising strategy for stabilizing the photo&#8208;sensitive components in photocatalysis. However, the underlying correlation between the enhanced photostability and supramolecular structure at the molecular level has not yet been fully understood. Herein, we develop a biomimetic vesicular membrane&#8208;based polyporphyrin photocatalyst exhibiting excellent photocatalytic stability with at least activity time of 240&#8197;h in hydrogen generation. Time&#8208;domain ab initio modelling together with transient absorption spectroscopy, visual frontier orbitals and Gibbs free energy calculation disclose that the ordered aggregation of porphyrin units in the vesicle membrane facilitates &#8220;hot&#8221; electron relaxation and the rapid dissipation of photo&#8208;generated charges, thereby contributing to the longevity. This work deepens the molecular&#8208;level understanding on photostability and photocatalytic mechanism of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Structure&#8208; and Data&#8208;Driven Protein Engineering of Transaminases for Improving Activity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using structure&#8208;dependent protein engineering of transaminases, a high&#8208;quality catalytic activity and stereoselectivity dataset was collected. A machine learning predictor was built based on this dataset and successfully applied in the data&#8208;driven protein engineering resulting in enzyme variants with significantly improved activity, higher and even inversed stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Amine transaminases (ATAs) are powerful biocatalysts for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines. Machine learning provides a promising approach for protein engineering, but activity prediction models for ATAs remain elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining high&#8208;quality training data. Thus, we first created variants of the ATA from Ruegeria sp. (3FCR) with improved catalytic activity (up to 2000&#8208;fold) as well as reversed stereoselectivity by a structure&#8208;dependent rational design and collected a high&#8208;quality dataset in this process. Subsequently, we designed a modified one&#8208;hot code to describe steric and electronic effects of substrates and residues within ATAs. Finally, we built a gradient boosting regression tree predictor for catalytic activity and stereoselectivity, and applied this for the data&#8208;driven design of optimized variants which then showed improved activity (up to 3&#8208;fold compared to the best variants previously identified). We also demonstrated that the model can predict the catalytic activity for ATA variants of another origin by retraining with a small set of additional data.

         <title>Experimental Confirmation of a Predicted Porous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework that was predicted previously to have 3D porosity and a remarkably low density of 0.37&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3 has been discovered experimentally. The structure of this framework matches the original prediction precisely and it has an accessible surface area of 3,284&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, as measured by nitrogen adsorption, making it one of the most porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks synthesized to date.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with low densities and high porosities are rare and challenging to design because most molecules have a strong energetic preference for close packing. Crystal structure prediction (CSP) can rank the crystal packings available to an organic molecule based on their relative lattice energies. This has become a powerful tool for the a priori design of porous molecular crystals. Previously, we combined CSP with structure&#8208;property predictions to generate energy&#8208;structure&#8208;function (ESF) maps for a series of triptycene&#8208;based molecules with quinoxaline groups. From these ESF maps, triptycene trisquinoxalinedione (TH5) was predicted to form a previously unknown low&#8208;energy HOF (TH5&#8208;A) with a remarkably low density of 0.374&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pores. Here, we demonstrate the reliability of those ESF maps by discovering this TH5&#8208;A polymorph experimentally. This material has a high accessible surface area of 3,284&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, as measured by nitrogen adsorption, making it one of the most porous HOFs reported to date.

         <title>High Dielectric Poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;Based Polymer Enables Uniform Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport in Solid&#8208;State Ionogel Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE) shows low adsorption energy on Pyr13+ from ionic liquids (ILs) than PVDF, which reduces the chance for Pyr13+ to occupy transport sites of Li+ and lower the Li+ migration barrier. In consequence, the Li+ transport in polymer phases is promoted, which narrows the gap of Li+ mobility between polymer phases with ILs and polymer&#8208;ILs interfaces, contributing to uniform Li+ flux to inhibit the lithium dendrites&#8217; growth.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs)&#8208;incorporated solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (iono&#8208;SPEs) have high ionic conductivities but show non&#8208;uniform Li+ transport in different phases. This work greatly promotes Li+ transport in polymer phases by employing a poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE), PTC] as the framework of ILs to prepare iono&#8208;SPEs. Unlike PVDF, PTC with suitable polarity shows weaker adsorption energy on IL cations, reducing their possibility of occupying Li+&#8208;hopping sites. The significantly higher dielectric constant of PTC than PVDF facilitates the dissociation of Li&#8208;anions clusters. These two factors motivate Li+ transport along PTC chains, narrowing the difference in Li+ transport among varied phases. The LiFePO4/PTC iono&#8208;SPE/Li cells cycle steadily with capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work paves a new way to induce uniform Li+ flux in iono&#8208;SPEs through polarity and dielectric design of polymer matrix.

This work greatly promotes Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport in polymer phases by employing a poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), PTC] as the framework of ILs to prepare iono-SPEs. Unlike PVDF, PTC with suitable polarity shows weaker adsorption energy on IL cations, reducing their possibility of occupying Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-hopping sites. The significantly higher dielectric constant of PTC than PVDF facilitates the dissociation of Li-anions clusters. These two factors motivate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport along PTC chains, narrowing the difference in Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport among varied phases. The LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PTC iono-SPE/Li cells cycle steadily with capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work paves a new way to induce uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux in iono-SPEs through polarity and dielectric design of polymer matrix.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noninvasive Early Diagnosis of Allograft Rejection by a Granzyme B Protease Responsive NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a non&#8208;invasive imaging strategy for sensing transplant rejection based on the granzyme B protease activity by using a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) nanosensor, ErGZ. ErGZ accomplished early detection of allograft rejection at 5 d post&#8208;operation by both in vivo fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinary excretion measurement, providing a promising alternative to biopsy for routine screening of early immunological rejection.







Abstract
Early diagnosis of allograft rejection helps to improve the immune&#8208;related management of transplant recipients. The clinically&#8208;used core needle biopsy method is invasive and subject to sampling error. In vivo fluorescence imaging for monitoring immune&#8208;related processes has the advantages of non&#8208;invasiveness, fast feedback and high sensitivity. Herein, we report a responsive second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent nanosensor (ErGZ) to detect early allograft rejection. ErGZ allows ratiometric in vivo fluorescence sensing of granzyme B, which is overexpressed in recipients&#8217; T cells during the onset of rejection. The sensor demonstrates efficacious detection of allograft rejection with high sensitivity and specificity, which accomplishes non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of rejection in skin and deep buried islets transplant mice models 2 d and 5 d earlier than biopsy, by in vivo fluorescence imaging and urinary detection, respectively, providing a valuable approach for therapeutical management.

         <title>Insight into Bioactivity of In&#8208;situ Trapped Enzyme&#8208;Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioactivity of the enzyme HRP immobilized with the covalent&#8208;organic framework COF&#8208;LZU1 is shown to be promoted by a weakest interaction between the enzyme and COF&#8208;LZU1, an easiest accessibility by the COF&#8208;LZU1 to the substrate, as well as an optimal conformation of enzyme inside the COF&#8208;LZU1. This comprehensive understanding of interfacial interactions, substrate diffusion, and enzyme conformation alteration aids the design of biocatalysts.







Abstract
Selecting a suitable support material for enzyme immobilization with excellent biocatalytic activity and stability is a critical aspect in the development of functional biosystems. The highly stable and metal&#8208;free properties of covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) make them ideal supports for enzyme immobilization. Herein, we constructed three kinds of COFs via a biofriendly and one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy at room temperature in aqueous solution. Among the three developed COFs (COF&#8208;LZU1, RT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACOF&#8208;1), the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;incorporated COF&#8208;LZU1 is found to retain the highest activity. Structural analysis reveals that a weakest interaction between the hydrated enzyme and COF&#8208;LZU1, an easiest accessibility by the COF&#8208;LZU1 to the substrate, as well as an optimal conformation of enzyme together promote the bioactivity of HRP&#8208;COF&#8208;LZU1. Furthermore, the COF&#8208;LZU1 is revealed to be a versatile nanoplatform for encapsulating multiple enzymes. The COF&#8208;LZU1 also offers superior protection for the immobilized enzymes under harsh conditions and during recycling. The comprehensive understanding of interfacial interactions of COF host and enzyme guest, the substrate diffusion, as well as the enzyme conformation alteration within COF matrices represents an opportunity to design the ideal biocatalysts and opens a broad range of applications of these nanosystems.

         <title>An Artificial Single Molecular Channel Showing High Chloride Transport Selectivity and pH&#8208;Responsive Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial anion channel with chloride selectivity comparable to that of natural chloride channel (ClC) proteins was achieved by rational engineering of the central active region of an hourglass&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule structure. By incorporating terminal pH&#8208;sensitive groups, our artificial anion channel also mimicked the pH&#8208;responsive feature of natural ClC proteins.







Abstract
Inspired by the unique structure and function of the natural chloride channel (ClC) selectivity filter, we present herein the design of a ClC&#8208;type single channel molecule. This channel displays high ion transport activity with half&#8208;maximal effective concentration, EC50, of 0.10&#8197;&#956;M, or 0.075&#8197;mol&#8201;% (channel molecule to lipid ratio), as determined by fluorescent analysis using lucigenin&#8208;encapsulated vesicles. Planar bilayer lipid membrane conductance measurements indicated an excellent Cl&#8722;/K+ selectivity with a permeability ratio P
/P
 up to 12.31, which is comparable with the chloride selectivity of natural ClC proteins. Moreover, high anion/anion selectivity (P
/P
=66.21) and pH&#8208;dependent conductance and ion selectivity of the channel molecule were revealed. The ClC&#8208;like transport behavior is contributed by the cooperation of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in the central macrocyclic skeleton, and by the existence of pH&#8208;responsive terminal phenylalanine residues.

         <title>Manipulating Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Stable Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase in 2.3&#8197;Ah Zn&#8208;Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the conventional &#8220;bulk solvation&#8221; mechanism, it is shown that the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) structure is dominated by electric double layer (EDL) adsorption. We manipulate the EDL adsorption and Zn2+ solvation with a series of ether additives (i.e. 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, and triglyme), and 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 with medium adsorption on EDL led to a layer&#8208;structured SEI.







Abstract
Constructing a reliable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is imperative for enabling highly reversible zinc metal (Zn0) electrodes. Contrary to conventional &#8220;bulk solvation&#8221; mechanism, we found the SEI structure is dominated by electric double layer (EDL) adsorption. We manipulate the EDL adsorption and Zn2+ solvation with ether additives (i.e. 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, and triglyme). The 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 with medium adsorption on EDL leads to a layer&#8208;structured SEI with inner inorganic ZnFx/ZnSx and outer organic C&#8722;O&#8722;C components. This structure endows SEI with high rigidness and strong toughness enabling the 100&#8197;cm2 Zn||Zn pouch cell to exhibit a cumulative capacity of 4250&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a 2.3&#8197;Ah Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#8901;n&#8201;H2O pouch cell delivers a recorded energy density of 104&#8197;Wh&#8201;Lcell&#8722;1 and runs for &gt;70&#8197;days under the harsh conditions of low negative/positive electrode ratio (2.2&#8201;:&#8201;1), lean electrolyte (8&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1), and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity (&#8776;13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ Interface Double&#8208;Site&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling for the Photothermal Conversion of CO2 into Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ interfacial double sites exhibits excellent selectivity toward light olefins during the hydrogenation of CO2 enhanced by light irradiation when compared with pure metallic Co. The interfacial effect of Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ exhibits a lower hydrogenation ability than metallic Co, tuning a pathway with a manageable activation barrier for C&#8722;C coupling.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation into multi&#8208;carbon products is a highly desirable, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction lies in the C&#8722;C coupling of C1 intermediates. Herein, we construct the C&#8722;C coupling centre for C1 intermediates via the in situ formation of Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ interface double sites on MgAl2O4 (Co&#8722;CoOx/MAO). Our experimental and theoretical prediction results confirmed the effective adsorption and activation of CO2 by the Co0 site to produce C1 intermediates, while the introduction of the electron&#8208;deficient state of Co&#948;+ can effectively reduce the energy barrier of the key CHCH* intermediates. Consequently, Co&#8722;CoOx/MAO exhibited a high C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons production rate of 1303&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1; the total organic carbon selectivity of C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons is 62.5&#8201;% under light irradiation with a high ratio (&#8776;11) of olefin to paraffin. This study provides a new approach toward the design of photocatalysts used for CO2 conversion into C2+ products.

         <title>Fused Triangulene Dimers: Facile Synthesis by Intramolecular Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling and Application for Near Infrared Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large graphene&#8208;like molecules with four zigzag edges are ideal gain medium materials for organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lasers. However, synthesizing them becomes increasingly challenging as the molecular size increases. In this study, we introduce a new intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach and successfully synthesize two fused triangulene dimers (1a/1b) efficiently. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 1a indicates that there is no intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid state. When the more soluble derivative 1b is dispersed in polystyrene thin films, amplified spontaneous emission in the NIR region is observed. Using 1b as the active gain material, we fabricate solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers that exhibit a narrow emission linewidth at around 790 nm. The laser devices also exhibit low thresholds with high photostability. Our study provides a new synthetic strategy for extended nanographenes, which have diverse applications in electronics and photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated High&#8208;Spin State and Constrained Charge Behavior of Active Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel type of covalent organic frameworks has been developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers that have varying electronic effects. This innovative approach has resulted in an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is understood by a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and the bond order theorem. The strong interaction between the electron&#8208;donating carbon nanotubes and the electron&#8208;accepting linker mitigates the trend of charge loss at cobalt sites, while inducing the generation of high spin state. This enhances the adsorption strength and electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates, leading to an improved oxygen reduction capability. This work not only presents an effective strategy for developing efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts through reticular chemistry, but also provides valuable insights into regulating the electronic configuration and charge behavior of active sites in designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Insoluble Polyoxometalate Clusters to Bridge Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster catalysts are attractive for their atomically precise structures, defined compositions, tunable coordination environments, uniform active sites, and their multielectron transfer ability, but suffer&#160;from poor stability and recyclability. Here, we report a general approach to the direct insolubilization of a water soluble polyoxometalate (POM) [{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)&#8208;(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8211; (Co7) to a series of POM&#8208;based solid catalysts with the counter&#8208;cations Ag+, Cs+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Y3+, and Ce3+, respectively. They exhibit improved catalytic activities for visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation following the trend CsCo7 &gt; SrCo7 &gt; AgCo7 &gt; CeIIICo7 &gt; BaCo7 &gt; YCo7 &gt; PbCo7. While CsCo7 exhibits mainly homogeneous catalysis, the others are predominantly heterogeneous catalysts. An optimal oxygen yield of 41.3% and a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 30.6% for SrCo7 is obtained, which is comparable to that of the parent homogeneous POM. Band gap structures, UV&#8208;vis spectra, and real&#8208;time laser flash photolysis experiments collectively suggest that the easier electron transfer from a solid POM catalyst to photosensitizer, the higher photocatalytic water oxidation performance. These solid POM catalysts exhibit good stability, which is directly confirmed by a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, five cycles of tests and poison experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitride Pillared Vanadate Via Chemical Pre&#8208;Intercalation Towards High&#8208;PerformanceAqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitrides (C3N4) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self&#8208;engaged hydrothermal strategy. Of note, C3N4 nanosheets can act as both the nitrogen source and pre&#8208;intercalation species to transform the orthorhombic V2O5 into layered NH4V4O10 with expanded interlayer spacing. Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn2+ ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH4V4O10 cathode are promoted. As a result, the NH4V4O10 cathode delivers exceptional Zn&#8208;ion storage ability with a high specific capacity of 398.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, a high&#8208;rate capability of 194.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1 and a stable cycling performance of 10000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208;Imidazole Based Mesoionic Carbenes and Anionic Dicar&#173;benes: Pushing the Limit of Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2&#8208;position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework (i.e. C2&#8208;carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;&#8208;donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so&#8208;called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;&#8208;donors than C2&#8208;carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author&#8217;s research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5&#8208;anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework, are presented.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classical N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2-position of 1,3-imidazole framework (i.e. C2-carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;-donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so-called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;-donors than C2-carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author&#8217;s research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5-anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3-imidazole framework, are presented. As will be apparent on following pages, iMICs and ADCs hold potentials in pushing the limit of classical NHCs by enabling access to conceptually new main-group heterocycles, radicals, molecular catalysts, ligands sets, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic pathway furnishing the first natural brexane&#8208;type bishomosesquiterpene (chlororaphen, C17H28) was elucidated in the &#947;&#8208;proteobacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6. A combination of genome mining, pathway cloning, in vitro enzyme assays, and NMR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;step pathway initiated by C&#8208;10 methylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP, C15) along with cyclization and ring contraction to furnish monocyclic &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP, C16).

         <title>Alkali Metal Dihydropyridines in Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysis of Imines: Amide Basicity versus Hydride Surrogacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of a representative set of imines, both aldimines and ketimines, to amines has been studied using transfer hydrogenation from 1,4&#8208;dicyclohexadiene. Unusually, this has been achieved using s&#8208;block pre&#8208;catalysts, namely 1&#8208;metallo&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5NM, M(tBuDHP), where M = Li&#8208;Cs. Reactions have been monitored in C6D6 and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;d8 (THF&#8208;d8). A definite trend is observed in catalyst efficiency with the heavier alkali metal tBuDHPs outperforming the lighter congeners. In general, Cs(tBuDHP) is the optimal pre&#8208;catalyst with, in the best cases, reactions producing quantitative yields of amines in minutes at room temperature using 5 mol% catalyst. Supporting the experimental study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have also been carried out which reveal that Cs has a pathway with a significantly lower rate determining step than the Li congener. In the postulated initiation pathways DHP can act as either a base or as a surrogate hydride.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering an Oxygen&#8208;Binding Protein for Photocatalytic CO2 Reductions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a homogeneous photocatalytic system based on cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) for CO2 to CO conversion in water. By optimizing the reaction conditions, our catalysts achieved up to 2000 TON(CO) at low enzyme concentrations, and a product selectivity of 
80&#8201;% with an increased enzyme loading. We show that the efficiencies of CO generation and overall TON(CO) can be improved by introducing positively charged residues near the active site of CoMb.







Abstract
While native CO2&#8208;reducing enzymes display remarkable catalytic efficiency and product selectivity, few artificial biocatalysts have been engineered to allow understanding how the native enzymes work. To address this issue, we report cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) as a homogeneous catalyst for photo&#8208;driven CO2 to CO conversion in water. The activity and product selectivity were optimized by varying pH and concentrations of the enzyme and the photosensitizer. Up to 2000 TON(CO) was attained at low enzyme concentrations with low product selectivity (15&#8201;%), while a product selectivity of 74&#8201;% was reached by increasing the enzyme loading but with a compromised TON(CO). The efficiency of CO generation and overall TON(CO) were further improved by introducing positively charged residues (Lys or Arg) near the active stie of CoMb, which demonstrates the value of tuning the enzyme secondary coordination sphere to enhance the CO2&#8208;reducing performance of a protein&#8208;based photocatalytic system.

         <title>Proton Tunneling Distances for Metal Hydrides Formation Manage the Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
In a series of manganese polypyridine complexes, the intramolecular proton tunnelling distances for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696&#8197;&#197; while the other structural, energetic, and electronic factors remain essentially similar. The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity of these catalysts is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH and the main product shifts from CO to HCOOH with a PTD&#8208;MH difference of ca. 0.3&#8197;&#197;.







Abstract
A series of manganese polypyridine complexes were prepared as CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Among these catalysts, the intramolecular proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696&#8197;&#197; while the structural, energetic, and electronic factors remain essentially similar to each other. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH within a difference of ca. 0.3&#8197;&#197;. Specifically, the catalyst functionalized with a pendent phenol group featuring a slightly longer PTD&#8208;MH favors the binding of proton to the [Mn&#8722;CO2] adduct rather than the Mn center and results in ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO product. In contrast, decreasing the PTD&#8208;MH by attaching a dangling tertiary amine in the same catalyst skeleton facilitates the proton binding on the Mn center and switches the product from CO to HCOOH with a selectivity of 86&#8201;%.

         <title>An Optochemical Oxygen Scavenger Enabling Spatiotemporal Control of Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optochemical oxygen scavenging system is reported that enables spatiotemporal control of hypoxia in cellular conditions. In this system, a selenium&#8208;containing rhodamine derivative works as an oxygen scavenging photocatalyst with glutathione as a co&#8208;reductant. This system consumed oxygen quickly and can establish localized hypoxic conditions even in cultured cells, providing a new chemical tool for hypoxia research.







Abstract
We present an optochemical O2 scavenging system that enables precise spatiotemporal control of the level of hypoxia in living cells simply by adjusting the light intensity in the illuminated region. The system employs rhodamine containing a selenium or tellurium atom as an optochemical oxygen scavenger that rapidly consumes O2 by photochemical reaction with glutathione as a coreductant upon visible light irradiation (560&#8211;590&#8197;nm) and has a rapid response time, within a few minutes. The glutathione&#8208;consuming quantum yields of the system were calculated as about 5&#8201;%. The spatiotemporal O2 consuming in cultured cells was visualized with a hypoxia&#8208;responsive fluorescence probe, MAR. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was applied to confirmed that different light intensities could generate different levels of hypoxia. To illustrate the potential utility of this system for hypoxia research, we show that it can spatiotemporally control calcium ion (Ca2+) influx into HEK293T cells expressing the hypoxia&#8208;responsive Ca2+ channel TRPA1.

&lt;p&gt;We present an optochemical O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavenging system that enables precise spatiotemporal control of the level of hypoxia in living cells simply by adjusting the light intensity in the illuminated region. The system employs rhodamine containing a selenium or tellurium atom as an optochemical oxygen scavenger that rapidly consumes O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by photochemical reaction with glutathione as a coreductant upon visible light irradiation (560&#8211;590&#8197;nm) and has a rapid response time, within a few minutes. The glutathione-consuming quantum yields of the system were calculated as about 5&#8201;%. The spatiotemporal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consuming in cultured cells was visualized with a hypoxia-responsive fluorescence probe, MAR. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was applied to confirmed that different light intensities could generate different levels of hypoxia. To illustrate the potential utility of this system for hypoxia research, we show that it can spatiotemporally control calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) influx into HEK293T cells expressing the hypoxia-responsive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel TRPA1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metabolic&#8208;Tag&#8208;Based Method for Assessing the Permeation of Small Molecules Across the Mycomembrane in Live Mycobacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method to systematically address the structural determinants of permeability in Mtb. This workflow, Peptidoglycan Accessibility Click&#8208;Mediated AssessmeNt (PAC&#8208;MAN), provides a screening platform to measure the permeation of any molecule that is modified with a small azide handle. When molecules reach the peptidoglycan layer, they react with DBCO (site selectively anchored by metabolic labeling), thus imprinting their permeation.







Abstract
The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high&#8208;throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide&#8208;tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly&#8208;discovered compounds into mycobacteria.

         <title>Systematic Enzymatic Synthesis of dTDP&#8208;Activated Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, diverse dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides, which are important but difficult to access, were successfully prepared on a large scale from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.







Abstract
Deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures in living organisms. However, most of the dTDP&#8208;sugars are difficult to obtain due to synthetic difficulties. The limited availability of dTDP&#8208;sugars has hindered progress in investigating the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and exploring new glycosyltransferases in nature. In this study, based on the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, a variety of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides were successfully prepared in high yields and on a large scale from readily available starting materials. The produced sugar nucleotides could provide effective tools for fundamental research in glycoscience.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Bound Diarylethene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films as Photoactuators with a Directed Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators is presented. The DAE units are assembled in a surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. The light&#8208;induced length changes of the DAE linkers multiply to anisotropic mesoscopic length changes. Due to the architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, here, bending a cantilever and performing work.







Abstract
Molecular machines and responsive materials open a plethora of new opportunities in nanotechnology. We present an oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators, arranged in a way to yield an anisotropic response. The DAE units are assembled, together with a secondary linker, into a monolithic surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. By Infrared (IR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy as well as by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, we show that the light&#8208;induced extension changes of the molecular DAE linkers multiply to yield mesoscopic and anisotropic length changes. Due to the special architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, leading to the bending of a cantilever and performing work. This research shows the potential of assembling light&#8208;powered molecules into SURMOFs to yield photoactuators with a directed response, presenting a path to advanced actuators.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution on Electrode&#8208;Supported Ptn Clusters: Ensemble of Hydride States Governs the Size Dependent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution on size&#8208;selected subnano Pt clusters supported on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) originates from hydride&#8208;like species (ca. 2&#8197;H/Pt), which form at a reductive electrode potential and are distinct from single atoms and bulk Pt. The size dependence of activity and stability were understood based on a grand canonical ensemble representation of the catalyst states and chemical bonding analysis.







Abstract
We report the size&#8208;dependent activity and stability of supported Pt1,4,7,8 for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and show that clusters outperform polycrystalline Pt in activity, with size&#8208;dependent stability. To understand the size effects, we use DFT calculations to study the structural fluxionality under varying potentials. We show that the clusters can reshape under H coverage and populate an ensemble of states with diverse stoichiometry, structure, and thus reactivity. Both experiment and theory suggest that electrocatalytic species are hydridic states of the clusters (&#8776;2&#8197;H/Pt). An ensemble&#8208;based kinetic model reproduces the experimental activity trend and reveals the role of metastable states. The stability trend is rationalized by chemical bonding analysis. Our joint study demonstrates the potential&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;coverage&#8208;dependent fluxionality of subnano clusters of different sizes and offers a systematic modeling strategy to tackle the complexities.

         <title>Structurally Simple Osmium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy in the Near Infrared
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmium&#8208;based polypyridyl complexes have been developed as photosensitizers for one&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy in the near infrared.







Abstract
Five osmium(II) polypyridyl complexes of the general formula [Os(4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2L]2+ were synthesized as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy by varying the nature of the ligand L. Thanks to the pronounced &#960;&#8208;extended structure of the ligands and the heavy atom effect provided by the osmium center, these complexes exhibit a high absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (up to 740&#8197;nm), unlike related ruthenium complexes. This led to a promising phototoxicity in vitro against cancer cells cultured as 2D cell layers but also in multicellular tumor spheroids upon irradiation at 740&#8197;nm. The complex [Os(4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)]2+ was found to be the most efficient against various cancer cell lines, with high phototoxicity indexes. Experiments on CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice also indicate that the OsII complexes could significantly reduce tumor growth following 740&#8197;nm laser irradiation. The high phototoxicity in the biological window of this structurally simple complex makes it a promising photosensitizer for cancer treatment.

     alt="Structurally Simple Osmium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy in the Near Infrared**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osmium-based polypyridyl complexes have been developed as photosensitizers for one-photon photodynamic therapy in the near infrared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five osmium(II) polypyridyl complexes of the general formula [Os(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; were synthesized as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy by varying the nature of the ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;. Thanks to the pronounced &#960;-extended structure of the ligands and the heavy atom effect provided by the osmium center, these complexes exhibit a high absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region (up to 740&#8197;nm), unlike related ruthenium complexes. This led to a promising phototoxicity in vitro against cancer cells cultured as 2D cell layers but also in multicellular tumor spheroids upon irradiation at 740&#8197;nm. The complex [Os(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2,2&#8242;-bipyridine)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was found to be the most efficient against various cancer cell lines, with high phototoxicity indexes. Experiments on CT26 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice also indicate that the Os&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes could significantly reduce tumor growth following 740&#8197;nm laser irradiation. The high phototoxicity in the biological window of this structurally simple complex makes it a promising photosensitizer for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Bandgap Emission for Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped carbon quantum dots (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield as well as a high electron mobility of up to 0.07&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes show a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6&#8201;% and a record maximum brightness of over 11&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) feature bright and tunable photoluminescence, solution processability, and low toxicity, showing great potential in optoelectronics. However, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of CQDs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has not been achieved so far. In this study, we perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped CQDs (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity PLQY (96&#8201;%). Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the large vertically oriented transition dipole moment of H&#8208;CQDs originating from high symmetry results in nearly 100&#8201;% PLQY. The H&#8208;CQDs also exhibited a high electron mobility of up to 0.07&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. These properties enable the H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6&#8201;% and a record maximum brightness of over 11&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study represents a significant advance that CQDs&#8208;based electroluminescent device can be utilized for potential display and lighting applications.

         <title>Restructuring and Activation of Cu(111) under Electrocatalytic Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential&#8208; and pH&#8208; dependent restructuring of the Cu(111) surface induced by H adsorption under electrochemical reduction in acidic conditions is decoded by a combination of a grand canonical ensemble representation of surface states and operando electrochemical STM experiments.







Abstract
The dynamic restructuring of Cu surfaces in electroreduction conditions is of fundamental interest in electrocatalysis. We decode the structural dynamics of a Cu(111) electrode under reduction conditions by joint first&#8208;principles calculations and operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) experiments. Combining global optimization and grand canonical density functional theory, we unravel the potential&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent restructuring of Cu(111) in acidic electrolyte. At reductive potential, Cu(111) is covered by a high density of H atoms and, below a threshold potential, Cu adatoms are formed on the surface in a (4&#215;4) superstructure, a restructuring unfavorable in vacuum. The strong H adsorption is the driving force for the restructuring, itself induced by the electrode potential. On the restructured surface, barriers for hydrogen evolution reaction steps are low. Restructuring in electroreduction conditions creates highly active Cu adatom sites not present on Cu(111).

         <title>Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries for the Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Biomass Aldehyde Derivatives and Concurrently Enhanced Power Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of a &#8220;Zn&#8208;organic battery&#8221; and a Cu nanosheet/Cu foil electrocatalyst were presented for the simultaneous efficient energy delivery and semi&#8208;hydrogenation of biomass aldehyde derivatives, achieving an impressive electrochemical performance of 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum power density and 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum current density.







Abstract
Electricity generation and chemical productions are both critically important for the sustainable development of modern civilization. Here, a novel bifunctional Zn&#8208;organic battery has been established for the concurrent enhanced electricity output and semi&#8208;hydrogenations of a series of biomass aldehyderivatives, for the high value&#8208;added chemical syntheses. Among them, the typical Zn&#8208;furfural (FF) battery equipped with Cu foil&#8208;supported edge&#8208;enriched Cu nanosheets as cathodic electrocatalyst (Cu NS/Cu foil), provides a maximum current density and power density of 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and in the meantime, produces high value product, furfural alcohol (FAL). The Cu NS/Cu foil catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance of &#8776;93.5&#8201;% conversion ratio and &#8776;93.1&#8201;% selectivity for FF semi&#8208;hydrogenation at a low potential of &#8208;1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl by using H2O as H source, and shows impressive performance for various biomass aldehyderivatives semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

         <title>The Regioselective Solid&#8208;State Photo&#8208;Mechanochemical Synthesis of Nanographenes with UV light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry and mechanochemistry have been combined to synthesize nanographenes in the complete absence of bulk solvents. The concept is showcased with two reactions&#8212;the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination, both applicable to the intramolecular formation of C&#8722;C bonds. Moreover, the approach can even form these bonds regioselectively in larger systems&#8212;something not possible before in mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemical reactors inherently suffer from the low penetration depth of light and therefore rely on high dilutions to enable chemical reactions. Here we present the first method of UV (ultraviolet) photochemistry in the complete absence of bulk solvents in a ball mill. Triphenylene was synthesized by two routes, the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination (CDHC), resulting in yields of 81 and 92&#8201;%, respectively. The reaction was successfully scaled up to the gram scale and the robustness of the method was demonstrated for several different substrates. Finally, the regioselective assembly of nanographenes by mechanochemistry was demonstrated for larger systems. Thus, the mechanochemical approach presented here provides a powerful new tool for the atomically precise construction of nanographenes.

         <title>GdIII&#8208;19F Distance Measurements for Proteins in Cells by Electron&#8208;Nuclear Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
GdIII&#8208;19F magnetic resonance measurements using electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) permit accessing the 1&#8211;1.5&#8197;nm distance range for proteins in human cells.







Abstract
Studies of protein structure and dynamics are usually carried out in dilute buffer solutions, conditions that differ significantly from the crowded environment in the cell. The double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) technique can track proteins&#8217; conformations in the cell by providing distance distributions between two attached spin labels. This technique, however, cannot access distances below 1.8&#8197;nm. Here, we show that GdIII&#8208;19F Mims electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements can cover part of this short range. Low temperature solution and in&#8208;cell ENDOR measurements, complemented with room temperature solution and in&#8208;cell GdIII&#8208;19F PRE (paramagnetic relaxation enhancement) NMR measurements, were performed on fluorinated GB1 and ubiquitin (Ub), spin&#8208;labeled with rigid GdIII tags. The proteins were delivered into human cells via electroporation. The solution and in&#8208;cell derived GdIII&#8208;19F distances were essentially identical and lie in the 1&#8211;1.5&#8197;nm range revealing that both, GB1 and Ub, retained their overall structure in the GdIII and 19F regions in the cell.

         <title>Pore &#8220;Softening&#8221; and Emergence of Breathability Effects of New Keplerate Nano&#8208;Containers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the porosity of new Keplerate type molecular nano&#8208;containers for the controlled interaction with their external chemical environment is investigated. Their crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions while the balancing act of kinetic and thermodynamic factors in conjunction with the emergence of amplified pore breathability that govern the functionality of the nano&#8208;containers is discussed.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of porous molecular nanocapsules offer unique opportunities to investigate a range of interesting phenomena and applications. However, to design nanocapsules with pre&#8208;defined properties, thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly of two elusive members of the Keplerate family, [Mo132Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {Mo132Se60} 1 and [W72Mo60Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {W72Mo60Se60} 2, that have been synthesised using pentagonal and dimeric ([Mo2O2Se2]2+) building blocks and their structures have been confirmed via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Our comparative study involving the uptake of organic ions and the related ligand exchange of various ligand sizes by the {Mo132Se60} and previously reported Keplerates {Mo132O60}, {Mo132S60} based on the ligand exchange rates, revealed the emergence of increased &#8220;breathability&#8221; that dominates over the pore size as we transition from the {Mo132S60} to the &#8220;softer&#8221; {Mo132Se60} molecular nano&#8208;container.

         <title>Metastable Hexagonal Phase SnO2 Nanoribbons with Active Edge Sites for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexagonal phase SnO2 nanoribbon with abundant edge&#8208;active sites has been successfully synthesized by microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal method. Due to its special structure and morphology, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts exhibit near 100&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising alternative to the energetically intensive anthraquinone process. However, there remain challenges in designing 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR catalysts that meet the application criteria. Here, we successfully adopt a microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal approach to synthesize hexagonal phase SnO2 (h&#8208;SnO2) nanoribbons with largely exposed edge structures. In 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts achieve the excellent H2O2 selectivity of 99.99&#8201;%. Moreover, when employed as the catalyst in flow cell devices, they exhibit a high yield of 3885.26&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the special crystal structure and morphology, resulting in abundantly exposed edge active sites to convert O2 to H2O2, which is confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Mechanically Activated Solid&#8208;State Radical Polymerization and Cross&#8208;Linking via Piezocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solventless free radical polymerization of solid vinyl monomers that is mechanically initiated by piezocatalytic BaTiO3 powders is reported. Activating BaTiO3 using hammer strikes and ball milling instigates hydroxyl radical production from surface&#8208;bound water in the solid state. Mechanoredox hydroxyl radicals are then directed to polymerize traditionally incompatible co&#8208;monomers and create cross&#8208;linked polymer resins dictated by mechanical input.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis offers a means to transduce mechanical energy into chemical potential, harnessing physical force to drive redox reactions. Working in the solid state, we show here that piezoelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles can transduce mechanical load into a flux of reactive radical species capable of initiating solid state free radical polymerization. Activation of a BaTiO3 powder by ball milling, striking with a hammer, or repeated compressive loading generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), which readily initiate radical chain growth and crosslinking of solid acrylamide, acrylate, methacrylate and styrenic monomers. Control experiments indicate a critical role for chemisorbed water on the BaTiO3 nanoparticle surface, which is oxidized to &#8901;OH via mechanoredox catalysis. The force&#8208;induced production of radicals by compressing dry piezoelectric materials represents a promising new route to harness mechanical energy for solid state radical synthesis.

         <title>Overcoming the Oxygen Dilemma in Photoredox Catalysis: Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Light&#8208;Triggered Peroxynitrite Generation for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>

The Nile blue derivative SNB can be both used as a type I photosensitizer and a near&#8208;infrared photocatalyst, enabling the simultaneous generation of superoxide anions (O2.&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) via type I photosensitization and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis, respectively. The combination of O2.&#8722; and NO leads to peroxynitrite generation under NIR light irradiation, showing great promise in antibacterial and antibiofilm applications.







Abstract
The peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) is closely associated with many diseases and the creation of ONOO&#8722; donors is an essential means of understanding its pathophysiological functions. However, it is challenging to develop ONOO&#8722; donors due to the difficulties in simultaneously producing highly reactive and short&#8208;lived nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;). Here, we report a novel strategy for constructing ONOO&#8722; donors by combining near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated type I photosensitization and photoredox catalysis. The key design using a Nile blue analogue that can serve as both a type I photosensitizer and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. Intriguingly, the formation of O2&#8901;&#8722; via type I photosensitization avoids oxygen interference and instead activates nitrobenzofurazan&#8208;based NO donors via oxygen&#8208;tolerant NIR photoredox catalysis. The simultaneous release of O2&#8901;&#8722; and NO leads to ONOO&#8722; release, showing both antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.

         <title>A Diode&#8208;Like Dye&#8208;Cu Anisotropic Junction in a Coordination Polymer as a Logic State Ratchet for Intratumor Redox Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By merging CuII ions and diphenylphenazine carboxylate ligands with discrete HOMO&#8211;LUMO dye sections, a multistable radical cationic coordination polymer with an anisotropic dye&#8208;Cu junction was constructed to achieve a diode&#8208;inspired unidirectional electron transfer and redox logic ratchet for the first time. Additionally, this material showed great potential for intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.







Abstract
Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area&#8208;specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with CuII salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye&#8208;Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode&#8208;like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained OFF status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral SERVO state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge&#8208;separated ON status promoted photo&#8208;Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Polymer from C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Oxidative Direct Arylation Polycondensation</title>

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative direct arylation polycondensation is firstly adopted to synthesize a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymer using a newly developed monomer, i.e., 3,6&#8208;di(thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (Tz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP). After n&#8208;doping, the polymer exhibited electric conductivity values up to 8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factors up to 106&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
n&#8208;Type conjugated polymers (CPs) are crucial in the applications of organic electronics. Direct coupling of electron&#8208;deficient C&#8722;H monomer via selective C&#8722;H activation, namely C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative direct arylation polycondensation (Oxi&#8208;DArP), is an ideal approach toward such CPs. Herein, Oxi&#8208;DArP is firstly adopted to synthesize a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type CP using a newly developed monomer, i.e., 3,6&#8208;di(thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (Tz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP). Tz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP based homopolymer PTz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP with a molecular weight of 22&#8197;kDa has been synthesized via Oxi&#8208;DArP. After n&#8208;doping, PTz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP films exhibited electric conductivity values up to 8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factors (PFs) up to 106&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Notably, this PF value is the highest for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials to date. The Oxi&#8208;DArP synthesis and the excellent n&#8208;type performance of the polymer make this work an important step toward the straightforward and sustainable preparation of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Activation of Peroxymonosulfate in Xanthene&#8208;Rich Systems for Fenton&#8208;Like Synergistic Decontamination: Efficacy of Proton Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable DPPA system for synergistic decontamination was proposed through selecting EB with xanthene structure as the model dye. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the activation process and significantly enhanced the production of reactive species. It was proved that the PTP was the crucial factor to determine the reactivity of DPPA system, mainly leading to the ISR and IDR of dye molecules.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;free visible light assisted Fenton&#8208;like catalysis offers opportunities to achieve the sustainable water decontamination, but the synergistic decontamination mechanisms are still unclear, especially the effect of proton transfer process (PTP). The conversion of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in photosensitive dye&#8208;enriched system was detailed. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the efficient activation of PMS and enhanced the production of reactive species. Photochemistry behavior analysis and DFT calculations revealed that PTP was the crucial factor to determine the decontamination performance, leading to the transformation of dye molecules. The excitation process inducing activation of whole system was composed of low energy excitations, and the electrons and holes were almost contributed by LUMO and HOMO. This work provided new ideas for the design of catalyst&#8208;free sustainable system for efficient decontamination.

A new robust palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alleneamination reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates is described. The salient features of this reaction include general substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboamination reaction is one of the most significant transformations in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alleneamination of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates. This protocol enables the efficient installation of various multisubstituted allene groups onto dihydropyrazoles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The chiral sulfinamide phosphine ligand Xu&#8208;5 exhibits highly efficient stereoselective control in this protocol. The salient features of this reaction include the readily available starting materials, a broad substrate scope, an easy scale&#8208;up, mild reaction conditions and versatile transformations.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Enhanced O&#8722;H Cleavage in Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a magnetic field, the spin&#8208;enhanced electrochemical water oxidation was observed on ferrimagnetic Fe3O4. In the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates, during which spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8722;H cleavage and triplet O&#8722;O bonding occur synergistically.







Abstract
Herein we report the vital role of spin polarization in proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated water oxidation over a magnetized catalyst. During the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, the external magnetic field induced a remarkable increase in the OER current, however, this increment achieved in weakly alkaline pH (pH&#8197;9) was almost 20 times that under strongly alkaline conditions (pH&#8197;14). The results of the surface modification experiment and H/D kinetic isotope effect investigation confirm that, at weakly alkaline pH, during the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates. The spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8722;H cleavage and triplet O&#8722;O bonding occur synergistically, which promotes the O2 generation more significantly than the strongly alkaline case involving only spin&#8208;enhanced O&#8722;O bonding.

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from Achiral Luminescent Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel near ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with excellent circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) properties are developed, which can sensitize diverse achiral luminescent materials to produce efficient CP&#8208;EL with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL efficiencies.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) is generally produced in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on special CP luminescent (CPL) materials, while common achiral luminescent materials are rarely considered to be capable of direct producing CP&#8208;EL. Herein, near ultraviolet CPL materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields and good CPL dissymmetry factors are developed, which can induce blue to red CPL for various achiral luminescent materials. Strong near ultraviolet CP&#8208;EL with the best external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 9.0&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved by using them as emitters for CP&#8208;OLEDs. By adopting them as hosts or sensitizers, commercially available yellow&#8208;orange achiral phosphorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF materials can generate intense CP&#8208;EL, with high dissymmetry factors and outstanding &#951;exts (30.8&#8201;%), demonstrating a simple and universal avenue towards efficient CP&#8208;EL.

         <title>Photosystem II Inspired NiFe&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Water Oxidation via Second Coordination Sphere Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electrocatalytic model that is designed to obtain superior oxygen evolution reaction activity (270&#8197;mV at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and cycle stability (over 300&#8197;h) by tuning the proton transfer pathway. The electron&#8208;rich terephthalic acid anion located in the second coordination sphere of the active center can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The mismatched fast&#8208;electron&#8208;slow&#8208;proton process in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the catalytic efficiency. To overcome these issues, accelerating the proton transfer and elucidating the kinetic mechanism are highly sought after. Herein, inspired by photosystem II, we develop a family of OER electrocatalysts with FeO6/NiO6 units and carboxylate anions (TA2&#8722;) in the first and second coordination sphere, respectively. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the metal units and TA2&#8722;, the optimized catalyst delivers superior activity with a low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability over 300&#8197;h. A proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;promotion mechanism is proposed by in situ Raman, catalytic tests, and theoretical calculations. The TA2&#8722; (proton acceptor) can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which optimizes the O&#8722;H adsorption/activation process and reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8722;O bond formation.

         <title>Construction of Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereoelements via Organo/Metal Dual Catalyzed Asymmetric Allenylic Substitution of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic strategy for the asymmetric allenylic substitution of aldehydes, which enables the construction of allene&#8208;containing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements, has been reported.







Abstract
A method for the asymmetric construction of functionalized acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements has been developed via organo/metal dual catalyzed asymmetric allenylic substitution of branched and linear aldehydes, by developing an unknown acyclic secondary&#8208;secondary diamine as the enabling organocatalyst. Although it is believed that secondary&#8208;secondary diamines are difficult to be used as the organocatalysts in organo/metal dual catalysis, this study demonstrates that such diamines can be successfully combined with a metal catalyst in organo/metal dual catalysis. Our study enables the asymmetric construction of two important classes of motifs which were previously difficult to access, axially chiral allene&#8208;containing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements bearing allenyl axial chirality and central chirality, in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Tip Sensor with a New Functional Nucleic Acid Probe for Food&#8208;borne Pathogen Salmonella typhimurium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and portable Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor was constructed to achieve specific, sensitive, and colorimetric detection of Salmonella typhimurium using an RNase H2&#8208;specific nucleic acid molecule derived from a random&#8208;sequence synthetic nucleic acid pool by in vitro selection.







Abstract
An Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor is developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella), using a new synthetic nucleic acid probe (NAP) as a linker for the immobilization of a DNA&#8208;conjugated Au nanoparticle (AuNP) onto a DNA&#8208;attached thin Au layer inside a pipette tip. In the presence of Salmonella, RNase H2 from Salmonella (STH2) cleaves the NAP and the freed DNA&#8208;conjugated AuNP can be visually detected by a paper strip. This portable biosensor does not require any electronic, electrochemical or optical equipment. It delivers a detection limit of 3.2&#215;103&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for Salmonella in 1&#8197;h without cell&#8208;culturing or signal amplification and does not show cross&#8208;reactivity with several control bacteria. Further, the sensor reliably detects Salmonella spiked in food samples, such as ground beef and chicken, milk, and eggs. The sensor can be reused and is stable at ambient temperature, showing its potential as a point&#8208;of&#8208;need device for the prevention of food poisoning by Salmonella.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Optically Active and Thermo&#8208;degradable Poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane gives environmental friendly poly(trifluoromethylmethylene) in high yield with controllable molar mass and low dispersity, which twisted into stable helix with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The high fluorine content results in high hydrophobicity, good resistance to chemical corrosion, high dielectric constant with low dielectric loss.







Abstract
Developing high performance and environment&#8208;friendly fluoropolymers is greatly desired. In this work, we found that 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane can be polymerized by air&#8208;stable alkyne&#8208;palladium(II) catalysts following a living polymerization mechanism, affording a fluoropolymer, poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) in high yield with controlled molar mass and low dispersity. This polymer bears trifluoromethyl on every main chain atom and thus has good resistance to chemical corrosion, high hydrophobicity, and excellent dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. Due to the steric hindrance between the trifluoromethyl pendants, the synthetic poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) can twist into a stable helix. The one&#8208;handed preferred helices synthesized using chiral PdII&#8208;catalysts exhibit high optical activity and circularly polarized luminescence. Remarkably, such polymer can be completely degraded to (E)&#8208;1,1,1,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobut&#8208;2&#8208;ene at high temperatures (&gt;280&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, taking advantage of the living chain end, the polymer can be further modified.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Isodesmic C&#8722;H Iodination of Phenylacetic Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization is unknown. Herein, an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution was reported.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization is unknown and enantioselective direct iodination of inert C&#8722;H bond is very rare. Rapid synthesis of chiral aromatic iodides is of significant importance for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution with PdII catalysis. Importantly, further transformations of the enantioenriched products are readily available at the iodinated or the Weinreb amide position, paving the way of related studies for synthetic and medicinal chemists.

         <title>Mosaic CuI&#8722;CuII&#8722;InIII 2D Perovskites: Pressure&#8208;Dependence of the Intervalence Charge Transfer and a Mechanochemical Alloying Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mosaic perovskites, featuring 3 different octahedral metal sites, allow for adjacent CuI/II sites, which otherwise does not occur in stoichiometric layered perovskites. The CuI/II intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) affords a 30&#8208;GPa reduction in the onset pressure for appreciable conductivity (10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to a CuII perovskite.







Abstract
The perovskite (BA)4[CuII(CuIInIII)0.5]Cl8 (1BA; BA+=butylammonium) allows us to study the high&#8208;pressure structural, optical, and transport properties of a mixed&#8208;valence 2D perovskite. Compressing 1BA reduces the onset energy of CuI/II intervalence charge transfer from 1.2&#8197;eV at ambient pressure to 0.2&#8197;eV at 21&#8197;GPa. The electronic conductivity of 1BA increases by 4 orders of magnitude upon compression to 20&#8197;GPa, when the activation energy for conduction decreases to 0.16&#8197;eV. In contrast, CuII perovskites achieve similar conductivity at &#8776;50&#8197;GPa. The solution&#8208;state synthesis of these perovskites is complicated, with more undesirable side products likely from the precursor mixtures containing three different metal ions. To circumvent this problem, we demonstrate an efficient mechanochemical synthesis to expand this family of halide perovskites with complex composition by simply pulverizing together powders of 2D CuII single perovskites and CuIInIII double perovskites.

         <dc:description>
Exploiting Ti and Mo diffusion chemistry, a Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.9Co0.09Mo0.01O2) featuring a 5&#8197;nm Li2TiO3 coating on the surface, a Mo&#8208;rich Li+/Ni2+ cation&#8208;ordered superlattice at the sub&#8208;surface, and Ti&#8208;doping in bulk is simultaneously constructed by just one&#8208;step calcination. This bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface modified structure feature effectively maintains the structural integrity of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes, thus exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability.

Nickel&#8208;rich (Ni&#8805;90&#8201;%) layered cathodes are critical materials for achieving higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density and lower&#8208;cost next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their bulk and interface structural instabilities significantly impair their electrochemical performance, thus hindering their widespread adoption in commercial LIBs. Exploiting Ti and Mo diffusion chemistry, we report one&#8208;step calcination to synthesize bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface modified LiNi0.9Co0.09Mo0.01O2 (NCMo90) featuring a 5&#8197;nm Li2TiO3 coating on the surface, a Mo&#8208;rich Li+/Ni2+ superlattice at the sub&#8208;surface, and Ti&#8208;doping in the bulk. Such a multi&#8208;functional structure effectively maintains its structural integrity upon cycling. As a result, such NCMo90 exhibits a high initial capacity of 221&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C), and high capacity retention of 94.0&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. This work opens a new avenue to developing industry&#8208;applicable Ni&#8208;rich cathodes for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Electrocatalytically Activating and Reducing N2 Molecule by Tuning Activity of Local Hydrogen Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically combines computational and experimental investigations and uncovers that N2 molecule can be effectively activated and reduced on electrocatalysts by tuning activity of local hydrogen radical.







Abstract
Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture. Herein, we achieve electrocatalytic activation/reduction of N2 on X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (X=Pd, Ir and Pt) dual&#8208;atom catalysts under ambient condition. We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N2 adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts for N2 activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8722;H bond. Specifically, X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with the weakest X&#8722;H bonding exhibits the highest H* activity, which is beneficial to the subsequent cleavage of X&#8722;H bond for N2 hydrogenation. With the most active H*, the Pd/Fe dual&#8208;atom site promotes the turnover frequency of N2 reduction by up to 10 times compared with the pristine Fe site.

         <title>A Polarized Gel Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is synthesized for flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries. The polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; functional groups in gel electrolyte not only form an electrical field to suppress Zn dendrite growth, but also prevent water from freezing and evaporating. The FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit long cycling life of 700&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, showing the application prospect under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The development of flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) has attracted broad attention in the field of wearable electronic devices. Gel electrolyte is one of the most important components in FZABs, which is urgent to be optimized to match with Zn anode and adapt to severe climates. In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain large amount of polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; functional groups. The polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; groups can form an electrical field between gel electrolyte and Zn anode to suppress Zn dendrite growth. Besides, the &#8722;COO&#8722; groups in PAM&#8208;SC can fix H2O molecules, which prevents water from freezing and evaporating. The polarized PAM&#8208;SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and water retention of 96.85&#8201;% after being exposed for 96&#8197;h. FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit long cycling life of 700&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, showing the application prospect under extreme conditions.

         <title>Remote Control of One&#8208;Handed Helicity in Polyacetylenes through Flexible Spacers in Water: Impact of the Spacer Length</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sergeants and soldiers&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in dynamic helical copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes was achieved in water as well as in aqueous and nonaqueous organic solvents through intramolecular hydrophobic interactions with a small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of achiral flexible oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S)&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing amphiphilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains. A small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (&#8804;10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of the achiral OEG spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones induced a complete one&#8208;handed helix in water through preferential intramolecular encapsulation of the binaphthyl groups within a cavity of the copolymers. A fully one&#8208;handed helix can be induced virtually independent of the OEG spacer length and concentrations. At a specific spacer length, however, its helix&#8208;sense was inverted. The copolymers also form an excess one&#8208;handed helix in organic solvents in an OEG spacer&#8208;length dependent manner, yet far from the polymer backbones. We show the superiority of the present covalent&#8208;bond driven S&amp;S&#8208;type remote helicity control over the corresponding noncovalent helicity induction approach.

&lt;p&gt;The sergeants and soldiers-type remote control of one-handed helicity in dynamic helical copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes was achieved in water as well as in aqueous and nonaqueous organic solvents through intramolecular hydrophobic interactions with a small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of achiral flexible oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the unprecedented sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S)-type remote control of one-handed helicity in copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing amphiphilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains. A small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (&#8804;10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of the achiral OEG spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones induced a complete one-handed helix in water through preferential intramolecular encapsulation of the binaphthyl groups within a cavity of the copolymers. A fully one-handed helix can be induced virtually independent of the OEG spacer length and concentrations. At a specific spacer length, however, its helix-sense was inverted. The copolymers also form an excess one-handed helix in organic solvents in an OEG spacer-length dependent manner, yet far from the polymer backbones. We show the superiority of the present covalent-bond driven S&amp;S-type remote helicity control over the corresponding noncovalent helicity induction approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cd/Pt Precursor Solution for Solar H2 Production and in situ Photochemical Synthesis of Pt Single&#8208;atom Decorated CdS Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for substantially higher photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), thereby eliminating the need for pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalysts for H2 production. Furthermore, in parallel to H2 production, a simplified solar light&#8208;assisted in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atom anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance H2 evolution catalysts, this remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for significant photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), removing the need for a pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalyst. In addition, we also report simultaneous in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) during photoirradiation. The highly dispersed in situ incorporation of extensive Pt single atoms on CdSIS enables the enhancement of active sites and suppresses charge recombination, which results in exceptionally high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of &#8776;1&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of over 91&#8201;% (365&#8197;nm) for H2 production. Our work not only provides a promising strategy for maximising H2 production efficiency but also provides a green process for H2 production and the synthesis of highly photoactive PtSA&#8208;CdSIS nanoparticles.

         <title>Assembly of an A6L6 Anion Trigonal Antiprism and Binding of Glucopyranosides and Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending triphenylphosphine oxide with three bis(urea) moieties has led to a ligand that assembles with phosphate anions to afford an unusual A6L6 trigonal antiprism. This antiprismatic cage features one central cavity and two large outer pockets which can bind monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000, and PEG2000), respectively, as confirmed by crystal structure analysis.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) has proven to be a very effective strategy for the construction of polyhedral structures. Here we demonstrate that variation of the &#8220;angle&#8221; of the backbone of C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, from triphenylamine to triphenylphosphine oxide, results in the change of the final construct from an A4L4 tetrahedron to a higher&#8208;nuclearity, A6L6 trigonal antiprism (A=anion, herein PO43&#8722;; L=ligand). Most interestingly, this assembly features a huge hollow internal space that is divided into three compartments: one central cavity and two large outer pockets. This multi&#8208;cavity character enables the binding of different guests, namely monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000 and PEG2000), respectively. The results prove that anion coordination by multiple hydrogen bonds may provide both sufficient strength and flexibility, thus making possible the formation of complicated structures with adaptive guest binding ability.

A convenient photo&#8208;catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed with 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO) to synthesize di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes with complete E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A diastereoselective C&#8208;vinylation of glycosides was also developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a concerted radical coupling pathway.







Abstract
We report an efficient radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling through photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO). This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild photocatalytic method has excellent functional group tolerance and affords vinylated products in good yields, with complete retention of the alkene configuration. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the diastereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;C bond formation is stereospecific and proceeds through a concerted radical coupling transition state.

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Structural Transformation of a 4&#8208;Ravel Containing Four Crossings and Featuring Cp*Rh/Ir Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings have been generated using a single&#8208;step strategy. This topology is achieved by utilizing parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with carefully selected naphthoquinoyl Cp*M building blocks and X&#8208;shaped pyridyl ligands.







Abstract
Intricately interwoven topologies are continually being synthesized and are ultimately equally versatile and significant at the nanoscale level; however, reports concerning ravel structures, which are highly entwined new topological species, are extremely rare and fraught with tremendous synthesis challenges. To solve the synthesis problem, a tetrapodontic pyridine ligand L1 with two types of olefinic bond units and two Cp*M&#8208;based building blocks (E1, M=Rh; E2, M=Ir) featuring large conjugated planes was prepared to perform the self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings were obtained by parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in a single&#8208;step strategy. Remarkably, reversible structural transformations between the 4&#8208;ravel and the corresponding metallocage could be realized by concentration changes and solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced effects. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy provide full confirmation of these phenomena.

         <title>Synchronously Manipulating Absorption and Extinction Coefficient of Semiconducting Polymers via Precise Dual&#8208;Acceptor Engineering for NIR&#8208;II Excited Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;acceptor engineering was used to synchronously manipulate the absorption and extinction coefficient of semiconducting polymers for the first time. The optimized agent, which exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption with high extinction coefficient and prominent photothermal conversion capability, shows an unprecedented performance in multi&#8208;modal phototheranostics for cancer.







Abstract
Integrating the ultralong excitation wavelength, high extinction coefficient, and prominent photothermal conversion ability into a single photothermal agent is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, a precise dual&#8208;acceptor engineering strategy is exploited for this attempt based on donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type semiconductor polymers by subtly regulating the molar proportions of the two employed electron acceptor moieties featuring different electronic affinity and &#960;&#8208;conjugation degrees, and making full use of the active intramolecular motion&#8208;induced photothermal effect. The optimal polymer SP4 synchronously shows desirable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) absorption, an extremely high extinction coefficient, and satisfactory photothermal conversion behavior. Consequently, the unprecedented performance of SP4 NPs on 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;excited photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor elimination.

We develop a multiscale&#8208;architected dot&#8208;wire&#8208;sheet microfiber made of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene/silk nanofiber hybrids via microfluidic fabrication. This hybrid fiber possesses enlarged interlayer spacing, enhanced accessible surface/H+ ion transport dynamic and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility. The resultant FSCs present high volumetric energy density, capacitance, cycling stability and actual energy&#8208;supply applications.







Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) have become one of the significantly strategical flexible energy&#8208;storage materials towards future wearable textile electronics and metaverse technologies. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance FSCs based on multiscale dot&#8208;wire&#8208;sheet heterostructure microfiber of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/silk nanofibers (NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs) hybrids via microfluidic fabrication. Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing, plentiful porous channels, accelerated H+ ion transport dynamics, large electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, the NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs possesses high volumetric capacitance (2218.7&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and reversible charge&#8211;discharge stability in 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state FSCs present high energy density (57.9&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), good capacitance (1157&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), long&#8208;life cycles (82.3&#8201;% capacitance retention after 40000&#8197;cycles), which realize the actual energy&#8208;supply applications (powering lamp, watch and toy car).

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Induced In Situ Michael Addition between Nanoparticles for Pyroptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8211;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles were prepared by biomineralization. In cancer cells, they disrupt the redox equilibrium and simultaneously compete for and consume intracellular glutathione (GSH) to form large aggregates, which mechanically disrupt the endosomal and plasma membranes, thus inducing pyroptosis and releasing inflammatory factors for activating immunological responses.







Abstract
Most tumor treatments will fail when ignoring competition and cooperation between each cancer cell and its microenvironment. Inspired by game theory, therapeutic agents can be introduced to compete for intracellular molecules to disrupt the cooperation between molecules and cells. Biomineralized oxidized (&#8722;)&#8208;epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8211;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles were prepared for disrupting redox equilibria and simultaneously reacting with intracellular GSH in a Michael addition to form large aggregates that can mechanically disrupt endosomal and plasma membranes, stimulating pyroptosis and anti&#8208;tumor immunological responses for versatile inhibition of different types of tumors. This design disrupts the cooperation between molecules and between cancer and immune cells, achieving an optimal payoff in competition and cooperation in cancer therapy.

         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective endo&#8208;boat intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction and a one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann condensation cascade formed the basis for the total synthesis of four natural antibiotics and one hydrogenated natural product derivative, all of which contain a cis&#8208;decalin ring bearing a tetramic acid.







Abstract
We report herein the first total syntheses of four natural antibiotics, vermisporin, PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A, AB4015&#8208;L, AB4015&#8208;B, and one hydrogenated natural product derivative, AB4015&#8208;A2, that all feature a tetramic acid bearing cis&#8208;decalin ring. The construction of the functionalized cis&#8208;decalin ring was achieved by a diastereoselective intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction, which proceeded via a rare endo&#8208;boat transition state. Through an intramolecular neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;oriented strategy, the sterically hindered epoxy group in vermisporin, PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A and AB4015&#8208;L was installed efficiently. A one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann condensation cascade using l&#8208;amino acid derivatives afforded the desired tetramic acid structure. The total synthesis led to the unambiguous verification of the absolute configuration of these natural products.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Synthesis of a Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Helical Ladder Polymer and Resolution into a Pair of Enantiomeric Helical Ladders
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative and chemoselective helical ladderization of a rationally designed random&#8208;coil polymer followed by chromatographic enantioseparation has led to a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated optically active helical ladder polymer composed entirely of achiral units. The sufficiently high helix&#8208;inversion barrier makes the helical ladder polymer with an excess of one&#8208;handed helicity thermally stable, maintaining its optical activity in solution even at 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Dual&#8208;Emitters Harness Excited&#8208;State Antiaromaticity for White Light Generation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;benzene dual&#8208;emitters are realized by proton transfer equilibrium between two emissive tautomers. We demonstrate that the excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity of the benzene core drives the proton movements. The dual&#8208;emitters produce white light in both solution and solid states, making them useful for white light&#8208;emitting devices and multicolor fluorescence imaging of fluorous nanodroplets in live cells.







Abstract
Molecular emitters simultaneously generating light at different wavelengths have wide applications. With a small molecule, however, it is challenging to realize two independent radiative pathways. We invented the first examples of dual&#8208;emissive single&#8208;benzene fluorophores (SBFs). Two emissive tautomers are generated by synthetic modulation of the hydrogen bond acidity, which opens up pathways for excited&#8208;state proton transfer. White light is produced by a delicate balance between the energy and intensity of the emission from each tautomer. We show that the excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity of the benzene core itself dictates the proton movements driving the tautomer equilibrium. Using this simple benzene platform, a fluorinated SBF was synthesized with a record high solubility in perfluorocarbon solvents. White light&#8208;emitting devices and multicolor imaging of perfluorocarbon nanodroplets in live cells demonstrate the practical utility of these molecules.

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Sonodynamic Activity of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Nanodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two inactive monomers incapable of generating singlet oxygen under ultrasound (US) irradiation were utilized for the reticular synthesis of a backbone&#8208;active covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with intrinsic sonodynamic activity. With Cu ions coordination, the fabricated TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu is demonstrated to exhibit a bilaterally enhanced nanodynamic feature of Cu ion&#8208;augmented sonodynamic activity and US&#8208;amplified chemodynamic catalytic efficacy.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizers with intrinsic sonodynamic effects is highly desirable. However, such COFs are generally constructed using small&#8208;molecule photosensitizers. Herein, we report that the reticular chemistry&#8208;based synthesis of COFs from two inert monomers yields a COF&#8208;based sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with inherent sonodynamic activity. Subsequently, a nanoscale COF TPE&#8208;NN is fabricated and embedded with copper (Cu)&#8208;coordinated sites to obtain TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Results show that Cu coordination can enhance the sonodynamic effect of TPE&#8208;NN, whereas ultrasound (US) irradiation for sonodynamic therapy can augment the chemodynamic efficacy of TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Consequently, TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu upon US irradiation shows high&#8208;performance anticancer effects based on mutually reinforced sono&#8208;/chemo&#8208;nanodynamic therapy. This study reveals the backbone&#8208;originated sonodynamic activity of COFs and proposes a paradigm of intrinsic COF sonosensitizers for nanodynamic therapy.

         <title>Electrically Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a chiral anion strategy, electrically amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells of readily obtained diastereomeric ionic transition&#8208;metal complexes. The addition of a chiral ionic liquid (IL) into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The development of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is currently hampered by the high difficulty and cost in the syntheses of suitable chiral materials and the notorious chirality diminishment issue in electrical devices. Herein, diastereomeric IrIII and RuII complexes with chiral (&#177;)&#8208;camphorsulfonate counteranions are readily synthesized and used as the active materials in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells to generate promising CPELs. The addition of the chiral ionic liquid (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole camphorsulfonate into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (&#8776;10&#8722;3), in stark contrast to the very weak circularly polarized photoluminescence of the spin&#8208;coated films of these diastereomeric complexes. Control experiments with enantiopure IrIII complexes suggest that the chiral anions play a dominant role in the electrically&#8208;induced amplification of CPELs.

         <title>Reversibly Modulating Plasmon&#8208;mediated Chemical Reaction via Electrode Potential on Reliable Copper Nanoelectrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and reliable copper nanoelectrodes (CuNEs) were fabricated. The reactions of aromatic nitro modified on the CuNE surface were probed using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS measurements. Cyclic conversions between aromatic nitro and its reduction products aromatic azo and aromatic amine were achieved by balancing electrochemical and Cu reductions with the plasmon&#8208;assisted photooxidation.







Abstract
Plasmonic metal nanostructures are essential for plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The nanostructures are commonly made from the coinage metals gold and silver. Copper (Cu) is less used mainly due to the difficulties in fabricating stable nanostructures. However, Cu is an attractive option with its strong plasmonic properties, high catalytic activities, and relatively cheap price. Herein, we fabricated tunable, reliable, and efficient Cu nanoelectrodes (CuNEs). Using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS, we have comprehensively studied the reversible chemical transformations between aromatic amine and nitro groups modified on the CuNE surface. Their PMCRs are well&#8208;controlled by changing the surface roughness, the oxidation states of Cu, and the applied electrode potential. We thus demonstrate that the Cu nanostructures enable better investigations in the interplays between PMCR, electrochemistry, and Cu catalysis.

Utilizing operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the sulfur cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are revealed. The results demonstrated that no Li2S6 and Li2S4 is formed but Li2S2 is observed. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles calculations disclose the formation energy of solid state Li2Sn (1&#8804;n&#8804;8), in which Li2S2 is a metastable phase.







Abstract
Due to its outstanding safety and high energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASLSBs) are considered as a potential future energy storage technology. The electrochemical reaction pathway in ASLSBs with inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes is different from Li&#8208;S batteries with liquid electrolytes, but the mechanism remains unclear. By combining operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the reaction mechanism of sulfur (S8) in ASLSBs. Our results revealed that no Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4 were formed, yet Li2S2 was detected. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles structural calculations were employed to disclose the formation energy of solid state Li2Sn (1&#8804;n&#8804;8), in which Li2S2 was a metastable phase, consistent with experimental observations. Meanwhile, partial S8 and Li2S2 remained at the full lithiation stage, suggesting incomplete reaction due to sluggish reaction kinetics in ASLSBs.

         <title>Highly Strong and Tough Supramolecular Polymer Networks Enabled by Cryptand&#8208;Based Host&#8208;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest recognition motifs with their high association constants have been exploited as cross&#8208;links to endow supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) with both excellent mechanical and dynamic properties. This approach also offers a fundamental understanding of the mechanism behind reinforcing SPNs with strong noncovalent cross&#8208;links, and acts as a guide for the design and preparation of high&#8208;performance dynamic materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, as they suffer from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross&#8208;links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance. Herein, we exploit the cryptand/paraquat host&#8208;guest recognition motifs as cross&#8208;links to prepare a class of highly strong and tough SPNs. Unlike those supramolecular cross&#8208;links with relatively weak binding abilities, the cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions have a high association constant and steady complexing structure, which effectively stabilizes the network and resists mechanical deformation under external force. Such favorable structural stability endows our SPNs with greatly enhanced mechanical performance, compared with the control&#8208;1 cross&#8208;linked by the weakly complexed crown ether/secondary ammonium salt motif (tensile strength: 21.1&#177;0.5 vs 2.8&#177;0.1&#8197;MPa; Young's modulus: 102.6&#177;4.8 vs 2.1&#177;0.3&#8197;MPa; toughness: 90.4&#177;2.0 vs 10.8&#177;0.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Moreover, our SPNs also retain abundant dynamic properties including good abilities in energy dissipation, reprocessability, and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. These findings provide novel insights into the preparation of SPNs with enhanced mechanical properties, and promote the development of high&#8208;performance intelligent supramolecular materials.

         <title>Photopolymerization&#8208;Driven Macroscopic Mechanical Motions of a Composite Film Containing a Vinyl Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal photopolymerization reaction of a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) vinyl coordination polymer (CP) produces a two&#8208;dimensional CP accompanied by an unprecedented phenomenon of photoinduced nonlinear lattice expansion. This 1D CP can be uniformly mixed with polyvinyl alcohol to form a composite film that exhibits macroscopic photomechanical motions such as bending, rolling, unrolling, lifting, grasping and jacking.







Abstract
We report a unique vinyl coordination polymer (CP), [Zn(4&#8208;Fb)2(tkpvb)]n (1, 4&#8208;HFb=4&#8208;fluorobenzoic acid, tkpvb=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridylvinyl)benzene) that undergoes a rare photopolymerization reaction to form a two&#8208;dimensional CP integrated with a one&#8208;dimensional linear organic polymer. Upon light irradiation at different wavelengths, 1 exhibits an unprecedented phenomenon of photoinduced nonlinear lattice expansion. 1 can be uniformly dispersed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form the composite film of 1&#8208;PVA. When this film is exposed to UV light, internal minute stresses within crystallites are released by lattice expansion, resulting in a variety of photopolymerization&#8208;driven macroscopic mechanical motions. The findings provide new insights into the conversion of small lattice expansions of CPs into macroscopic mechanical motions based on photopolymerization reactions, which can promote the development of CPs&#8208;based smart photoactuators in the burgeoning field of microrobotics.

         <title>A Dynamic Defect Generation Strategy for Efficient Enzyme Immobilization in Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Catalytic Hydrolysis and Chiral Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic defect generation strategy for enzyme immobilization in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed. Enzymes can act as &#8220;macro ligands&#8221; to generate competitive coordination and form defects, hence promoting the gradual transport of enzymes in MOFs, and forming enzyme@MOFs with good protective performance and exceptional reusability as enzyme@MOF catalysts.







Abstract
Enzyme immobilization has been demonstrated to be a favorable protocol for promoting the industrialization of bioactive molecules, but still with formidable challenge. Addressing this challenge, we create a dynamic defect generation strategy for enzyme immobilization by using the dissociation equilibrium of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) mediated by enzymes. Enzymes can act as &#8220;macro ligands&#8221; to generate competitive coordination against original ligands, along with the release of metal clusters of MOFs to generate defects, hence promoting the gradual transport of enzymes from the surface to inside. Various enzymes can be efficiently immobilized in MOFs to afford composites with good enzymatic activities, protective performances and exceptional reusabilities. Moreover, multienzyme bioreactors capable of efficient cascade reactions can also be generated. This study provides new opportunities to construct highly efficient biocatalysts incorporating different types of enzymes.

         <title>Understanding the Synthesis Kinetics of Single&#8208;Crystal Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries is explored. A quasi&#8208;equilibrium reaction path is driven at low reaction temperature to induce a low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation, which can promote the rapid formation of the layered phase, thus contributing to the formation of highly ordered layered oxides in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium kinetic intermediates are usually preferentially generated instead of thermodynamic stable phases in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of layered oxides. Understanding the inherent complexity between thermodynamics and kinetics is important for designing high cationic ordering cathodes. Single&#8208;crystal strategy is an effective way to solve the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical problems of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the synthesis of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal is very challenging. Herein, the kinetic reaction path and the formation mechanism of non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates in the synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich were explored. We demonstrate that the formation of non&#8208;equilibrium intermediate and the electrochemical&#8208;thermo&#8208;mechanical failure can be effectively inhibited by driving low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation.

     alt="Understanding the Synthesis Kinetics of Single-Crystal Co-Free Ni-Rich Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of single-crystal Co-free Ni-rich layered cathodes for Li-ion batteries is explored. A quasi-equilibrium reaction path is driven at low reaction temperature to induce a low-temperature topotactic lithiation, which can promote the rapid formation of the layered phase, thus contributing to the formation of highly ordered layered oxides in the solid-state synthesis of single-crystal Co-free Ni-rich cathodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-equilibrium kinetic intermediates are usually preferentially generated instead of thermodynamic stable phases in the solid-state synthesis of layered oxides. Understanding the inherent complexity between thermodynamics and kinetics is important for designing high cationic ordering cathodes. Single-crystal strategy is an effective way to solve the intrinsic chemo-mechanical problems of Ni-rich cathodes. However, the synthesis of high-performance single-crystal is very challenging. Herein, the kinetic reaction path and the formation mechanism of non-equilibrium intermediates in the synthesis of single-crystal Co-free Ni-rich were explored. We demonstrate that the formation of non-equilibrium intermediate and the electrochemical-thermo-mechanical failure can be effectively inhibited by driving low-temperature topotactic lithiation. This work provides a basis for designing high-performance single-crystal Ni-rich layered oxides by regulating the defective structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Triplet Excited States of Organic Semiconductors via Tuning Molecular Conformation for Dual&#8208;ratiometric Thermometers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of noncovalent intramolecular interactions was fine&#8208;tuned to systematically modulate the triplet states, resulting in efficient room temperature phosphorescence and two well&#8208;separated emission bands. An unprecedented organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of two bands, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometry is one of highly accurate methods for microscopic thermal measurement in biological systems. Herein, a series of chromone derivatives with noncovalently intramolecular interactions (NIIs) were designed and synthesized for ratiometric thermometers. The triplet states of these organic compounds were systematically tuned upon regulating the conformation with NIIs to yield efficient room temperature phosphorescence and large wavelength difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence simultaneously. As a result, an unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on the intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of fluorescence/phosphorescence vs temperature, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy. This work provides a novel method to achieve organic dual ratiometric thermometers via tuning the triplet excited states.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Resistant BODIPY Amino Acids for Peptide&#8208;Based Fluorescence Imaging of GPR54 Receptors in Pancreatic Islets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS as a new acid&#8208;resistant building block for straightforward solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorogenic peptides. We demonstrate the utility of Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS with the first fluorogenic probe for direct visualization and quantitative analysis of the expression and localization of the G protein&#8208;coupled receptors&#8197;54 (GPR54 or kisspeptin) in human cells and intact mouse pancreatic islets.







Abstract
The G protein&#8208;coupled kisspeptin receptor (GPR54 or KISS1R) is an important mediator in reproduction, metabolism and cancer biology; however, there are limited fluorescent probes or antibodies for direct imaging of these receptors in cells and intact tissues, which can help to interrogate their multiple biological roles. Herein, we describe the rational design and characterization of a new acid&#8208;resistant BODIPY&#8208;based amino acid (Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS), and its implementation for solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent bioactive peptides. Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS retains the binding capabilities of both short linear and cyclic peptides and displays notable turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission upon target binding for wash&#8208;free imaging. Finally, we employed Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS to prepare some of the first fluorogenic kisspeptin&#8208;based probes and visualized the expression and localization of GPR54 receptors in human cells and in whole mouse pancreatic islets by fluorescence imaging.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures. In their Research Article (e202217894), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers have developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.

Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings were designed rationally and synthesized successfully using a single&#8208;step strategy as described by Li&#8208;Long Dang, Guo&#8208;Xin Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202301516). This new topology is achieved by utilizing parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with carefully selected naphthoquinoyl Cp*M building blocks and X&#8208;shaped pyridyl ligands.

         <title>Safer Polyurethane Foams with Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work to produce polyurethane (PU) foams without the safety concerns of current commercial PU monomers is highlighted. The new chemistry utilizes cyclic carbonates which undergo hydrolysis to produce the blowing gas for the foaming process.







Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of materials usually synthesized from isocyanates, diols, and water. Water is essential for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used for the self&#8208;blowing of the foams. Due to safety concerns with the production of isocyanates, alternative chemistries have been evaluated and cyclic carbonate systems have shown great promise. In a recent advancement by Bourguignon, Grignard, and Detrembleur, a cyclic carbonate and diamine system is capable of generating CO2 for self&#8208;blowing through hydrolysis of the carbonate&#8208;based monomer. The authors demonstrate that with a simple variation of the diamine monomer a wide range of physical and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties were achievable. This work represents a significant step towards safer and more environmentally friendly PUs.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Conjugate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric conjugate reduction (ACR) reactions have emerged over the last decades as straightforward and powerful transformations that provide direct access to chiral building blocks bearing ubiquitous trisubstituted stereocenters. This comprehensive Review focuses on the three areas of catalysis that contributed the most to the development of ACR chemistry: transition&#8208;metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis.







Abstract
Enantioselective reduction reactions are privileged transformations for the construction of trisubstituted stereogenic centers. While these include established synthetic strategies, such as asymmetric hydrogenation, methods based on the enantioselective addition of hydridic reagents to electrophilic prochiral substrates have also gained importance. In this context, the asymmetric conjugate reduction (ACR) of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds has become a convenient approach for the synthesis of chiral compounds with trisubstituted stereocenters in &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, or &#947;&#8208;position to electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups. Because such activating groups are diverse and amenable of further derivatizations, ACRs provide a general and powerful synthetic entry towards a variety of valuable chiral building blocks. This Review provides a comprehensive collection of catalytic ACR methods involving transition&#8208;metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis since its first versions dating back to the late 1970s.

         <title>Fluorescent Flippers: Small&#8208;Molecule Probes to Image Membrane Tension in Living Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of fluorescent flippers as membrane tension probes is described in the context of the general challenge to create chemistry tools to image physical forces in living systems.







Abstract
Flipper probes have been introduced as small molecule fluorophores to image physical forces, that is, membrane tension in living systems. Their emergence over one decade is described, from evolution in design and synthesis to spectroscopic properties. Responsiveness to physical compression in equilibrium at the ground state is identified as the ideal origin of mechanosensitivity to image membrane tension in living cells. A rich collection of flippers is described to deliver and release in any subcellular membrane of interest in a leaflet&#8208;specific manner. Chalcogen&#8208;bonding cascade switching and dynamic covalent flippers are developed for super&#8208;resolution imaging and dual&#8208;sensing of membrane compression and hydration. Availability and broad use in the community validate flipper probes as a fine example of the power of translational supramolecular chemistry, moving from fundamental principles to success on the market.

         <title>Molecular Mechanisms behind Acetylene Adsorption and Selectivity in Functional Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. It also discusses the challenges in translational research for the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlights areas which require future research efforts.







Abstract
Since its first industrial production in 1890s, acetylene has played a vital role in manufacturing a wide spectrum of materials. Although current methods and infrastructures for various segments of acetylene industries are well&#8208;established, with emerging functional porous materials that enabled desired selectivity toward target molecules, it is of timely interest to develop new efficient technologies to promote safer acetylene processes with a higher energy efficiency and lower carbon footprint. In this Minireview, we, from the perspective of materials chemistry, review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. We also discuss the challenges on the roadmap of translational research in the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlight areas which require future research efforts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for C6 Alkane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the recent advancement in developing MOFs as energy&#8208;efficient adsorbents for the separation of C6 alkane isomers based on different separation mechanisms. Particular emphasis is made on the design and tailoring of their structures and pore properties to achieve optimal separation performance. Existing challenges and possible solutions, as well as future directions of this important research field are also discussed.







Abstract
The separation of alkane isomers is an important yet challenging process in the petrochemical industry. Being a crucial step to produce premium gasoline components as well as optimum ethylene feed, the current industrial separation by distillation is extremely energy intensive. Adsorptive separation based on zeolite is limited by insufficient adsorption capacity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold enormous promise as alternative adsorbents due to their diverse structural tunability and exceptional porosity. Precise control of their pore geometry/dimensions has led to superior performance. In this minireview, we highlight the recent progresses in developing MOFs for the separation of C6 alkane isomers. Representative MOFs are reviewed based on their separation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the material design rationale for achieving optimal separation capability. Finally, we briefly discuss the existing challenges, possible solutions, and future directions of this important field.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations Guide Chimeragenesis and Engineered Control of Chemoselectivity in Diketopiperazine Dimerases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of C&#8722;N bond forming diketopiperazine dimerase, AspB, was solved. However, the near complete superposition of active site residues and bound substrates in AspB/NzeB masked the molecular basis for their orthogonal chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics simulations guided rational chimeragenesis to reprogram NzeB dimerase selectivity. Substrate mimics further validated differential substrate binding by the chemodivergent dimerases.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the tryptophan&#8208;linked dimeric diketopiperazines (DKPs), cytochromes P450 selectively couple DKP monomers to generate a variety of intricate and isomeric frameworks. To determine the molecular basis for selectivity of these biocatalysts we obtained a high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of selective Csp2&#8722;N bond forming dimerase, AspB. Overlay of the AspB structure onto C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming homolog NzeB revealed no significant structural variance to explain their divergent chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified a region of NzeB with increased conformational flexibility relative to AspB, and interchange of this region along with a single active site mutation led to a variant that catalyzes exclusive C&#8722;N bond formation. MD simulations also suggest that intermolecular C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation results from a change in mechanism, supported experimentally through use of a substrate mimic.

         <title>Monitoring Cardiac Biomarkers with Aptamer&#8208;Based Molecular Pendulum Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic biomolecular analysis technique enabled by high&#8208;performance signal transduction with molecular pendulums is presented. The approach was applied to the analysis of cardiac biomarkers with low femtomolar detection limits and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.







Abstract
Reagent&#8208;free electronic biosensors capable of analyzing disease markers directly in unprocessed body fluids will enable the development of simple &amp; affordable devices for personalized healthcare monitoring. Here we report a powerful and versatile nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic sensing system. The signal transduction is based on the kinetics of an electrode&#8208;tethered molecular pendulum&#8212;a rigid double stranded DNA with one of the strands displaying an analyte&#8208;binding aptamer and the other featuring a redox probe&#8212;that exhibits field&#8208;induced transport modulated by receptor occupancy. Using chronoamperometry, which enables the sensor to circumvent the conventional Debye length limitation, the binding of an analyte can be monitored as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag. The sensing platform demonstrates a low femtomolar quantification limit and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in analyzing cardiac biomarkers in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Construction in Water Towards Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on strong metal&#8208;support interaction construction were produced leveraging the instantaneous energy input from ultrasonication under near&#8208;ambient conditions in H2O. Encapsulation of the metal nanoparticles was achieved via the formation of reducible metal oxide overlayers, leading to enhanced performance and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions and CO2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of facile methodologies to afford robust supported metal nanocatalysts under mild conditions is highly desirable yet challenging, particularly via strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) construction. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches capable of generating SMSI encapsulation mainly focus on high temperature annealing in reductive/oxidative atmosphere. Herein, ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on SMSI construction were produced by leveraging the instantaneous high&#8208;energy input from ultrasonication under ambient conditions in H2O, which could rapidly afford abundant active intermediates, Ti3+ ions, and oxygen vacancies within the scaffolds to induce the SMSI overlayer formation. The encapsulation degree could be tuned and controlled via the reducibility of the solvents and the ultrasonication parameters. This facile and efficient approach could be further extended to diverse metal oxide supports and noble metal NPs leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation reactions and CO2 conversion.

         <title>Comproportionation of CO2 and Cellulose to Formate Using a Floating Semiconductor&#8208;Enzyme Photoreforming Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous formate formation from CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation is enabled by a biohybrid photocatalyst with formate dehydrogenase immobilized on titanium dioxide. The semi&#8208;artificial photocatalytic system can be further immobilized onto floating hollow glass microspheres allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst and thereby mimicking the trajectory of real sunlight.







Abstract
Formate production via both CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation in a solar&#8208;driven process is achieved by a semi&#8208;artificial biohybrid photocatalyst consisting of immobilized formate dehydrogenase on titanium dioxide (TiO2|FDH) producing up to 1.16&#177;0.04&#8197;mmolformate&#8201;g
&#8722;1 in 24&#8197;hours at 30 &#176;C and 101 kPa under anaerobic conditions. Isotopic labeling experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled substrates support the mechanism of stoichiometric formate formation through both redox half&#8208;reactions. TiO2|FDH was further immobilized on hollow glass microspheres to perform more practical floating photoreforming allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst to real sunlight. Enzymatic cellulose depolymerization coupled to the floating photoreforming catalyst generates 0.36&#177;0.04&#8197;mmolformate per m2 irradiation area after 24&#8197;hours. This work demonstrates the synergistic solar&#8208;driven valorization of solid and gaseous waste streams using a biohybrid photoreforming catalyst in aqueous solution and will thus provide inspiration for the development of future semi&#8208;artificial waste&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion strategies.

         <title>Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Ethyl Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II/III) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Alkyl Glycosides</title>

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)/phosphine catalytic system enabled efficient domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H ethyl glycosylations. Thus 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides were obtained via the selective assembly of easily accessible glycosyl bromide and alkenes under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Glycosyl anomeric radical addition reactions have been well&#8208;explored and proved efficient for the C&#8208;alkyl glycosides synthesis, but multicomponent Domino transformations for the rapid and controllable construction of structurally diversified C&#8208;alkyl glycosides in a single step are still rare. In contrast, we, herein, report a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H ethyl glycosylation, enabling the construction of challenging meta&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. Our ruthenium(II) catalysis was reflected by the mild reaction condition, exclusive meta&#8208;site selectivity and high levels of anomeric selectivity. In addition, the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation allowed for the synthesis of versatile 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with commercially available vinyl arenes, acrylates and easily accessible glycosyl bromides.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Mediated Radical Stabilization and Dynamic Covalent Bonding: Tunable, Reversible and Photocontrollable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a Lewis acid into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer led to a radical, which is stabilized by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photocontrollability.







Abstract
This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photo controllability. The addition of Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (BCF) into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer (1&#8208;1) led to a stable radical (1&#8901;&#8208;2B), which has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in conjunction with theoretical calculation. The radical species is stabilized mainly by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. The absorption maximum of the radical can be tuned by using different Lewis acids. Dimer 1&#8208;1 can be achieved back by addition of a stronger base into the solution of 1&#8901;&#8208;2B, exhibiting a reversible process. By introducing a photo BCF generator, the dissociation of the dimer and the formation of the radical adduct become photocontrollable.

         <title>Structural and Morphological Transformations of Covalent Organic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine bonds at the ortho&#8208;position of the benzene ring undergo a click rearrangement to form the imidazole ring. Two such geminal imine bonds in covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) convert imine CONTs to imidazole CONTs. The CONTs exhibit two types of self&#8208;assembly like gold nanorods, i.e., side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly and head&#8208;to&#8208;head assembly.







Abstract
Covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) are porous one&#8208;dimensional frameworks connected through imine bonds via Schiff base condensation between aldehydes and amines. The presence of two amine groups at the ortho position in the structurally demanding tetraaminotriptycene (TAT) building block leads to multiple reaction pathways between the ditopic aldehyde and the tetratopic amine. We have synthesized five different monomers of CONT&#8208;1 by the Schiff base condensation reaction between TAT and o&#8208;anisaldehyde. The conversion of imine to imidazole bonding in a monomer is probed using NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Solid&#8208;state NMR provide insights into the CONTs&#8217; structural connectivity. A theoretical investigation suggests that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking could be the driving force for rapid imine to imidazole conversion within the CONT&#8208;1. Microscopic imaging sheds further light on the self&#8208;assembly process of the CONTs, indicating both head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly.

We have synthesized five different monomers of CONT-1 by the Schiff base condensation reaction between TAT and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-anisaldehyde. The conversion of imine to imidazole bonding in a monomer is probed using NMR, mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction techniques. Solid-state NMR provide insights into the CONTs&#8217; structural connectivity. A theoretical investigation suggests that the &#960;-&#960; stacking could be the driving force for rapid imine to imidazole conversion within the CONT-1. Microscopic imaging sheds further light on the self-assembly process of the CONTs, indicating both head-to-head and side-by-side assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric C1 Extension of Aldehydes through Biocatalytic Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Mandelic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades consisting of L&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA), L&#8208;threonine dehydratase (LTD) and 4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) were developed for cyanide&#8208;free asymmetric C1&#8208;extension. Engineering of the central enzyme, HmaS, enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of mandelic acids from glycine and aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral building blocks from simple, renewable carbon units has been a long&#8208;term goal of the sustainable chemical industry. Mandelate derivatives are valuable pharmaceutical intermediates and chiral resolving agents, but their manufacture relies heavily on highly toxic cyanide. Herein, we report (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS)&#8208;centered biocatalytic cascades for the synthesis of mandelates from benzaldehydes and glycine. We show that HmaS can be engineered to perform R&#8208;selective hydroxylation by single&#8208;point mutation, empowering the stereodivergent synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;mandelate derivatives. These biocatalytic cascades enabled the production of various mandelate derivatives with high atom economy as well as excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and ee values (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers an effective cyanide&#8208;free technology for greener and sustainable production of mandelate derivatives.

         <title>A Simple Molecular Design Strategy for Pure&#8208;Red Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy to construct pure&#8208;red multiple resonance (MR) emitters was successfully implemented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule PPZ&#8208;BN achieves a significant redshift of more than 125&#8197;nm compared to the selected parent MR core. The corresponding narrowband red organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9&#8201;%, a small efficiency roll&#8208;off, and an excellent operation stability.







Abstract
Though the flourishment of materials with multiple resonance (MR) in blue to green regions, red&#8208;emissive MR emitters are still rare in literatures, which definitely should be resolved for further applications. Herein, we report a simple molecular design strategy for the construction of pure&#8208;red MR emitters by conjugate charge transfer, which could greatly enhance the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and charge&#8208;transfer property of the target molecule while maintaining the basic feature of MR, leading to a significant redshift of more than 128&#8197;nm compared to the selected parent MR core. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter PPZ&#8208;BN exhibited a pure&#8208;red emission with a dominant peak at 613&#8197;nm and a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 0.16&#8197;eV (48&#8197;nm). The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode showed a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9&#8201;%, a small efficiency roll&#8208;off, and an excellent operation stability (LT99) of more than 43&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Square&#8208;Planar Anionic Pt0 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a diphosphine&#8208;borane ligand DPB enables straightforward access to anionic Pt0 complexes. [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; complexes were isolated and fully characterized. They represent unique examples of square&#8208;planar Pt0 complexes, as substantiated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A T&#8208;shaped Pt0 complex with a diphosphine&#8208;borane (DPB) ligand was prepared. The Pt&#8594;B interaction enhances the electrophilicity of the metal and triggers the addition of Lewis bases to give the corresponding tetracoordinate complexes. For the first time, anionic Pt0 complexes are isolated and structurally authenticated. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show the anionic complexes [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; (X=CN, Cl, Br, I) to be square&#8208;planar. The d10 configuration and Pt0 oxidation state of the metal were unambiguously established by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The coordination of Lewis acids as Z&#8208;type ligands is a powerful mean to stabilize elusive electron&#8208;rich metal complexes and achieve uncommon geometry.

         <title>Polydopamine as a Visible&#8208;Light Photosensitiser for Photoinitiated Polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine free radicals are observed to be photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, amplifying semiquinone radical population and modifying redox potential. Using polydopamine nanoparticles, the researchers photo&#8208;initiate free&#8208;radical polymerization of vinylic monomers via sensitization of a diphenyliodonium photo&#8208;initiator. This work offers important insights into melanin&#8208;like materials and presents PDA as a promising photosensitizer.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic model for melanin and has a wide range of opto&#8208;electronic properties that underpin its utility in applied and biological settings, from broadband light absorbance to possessing stable free radical species. Here, we show that PDA free radicals are photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, enabling PDA to serve as a photo&#8208;redox catalyst. Steady&#8208;state and transient electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals a reversible amplification in semiquinone radical population within PDA under visible light. This photo&#8208;response modifies the redox potential of PDA and supports sensitisation of exogenous species via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). We demonstrate the utility of this discovery by employing PDA nanoparticles to photosensitise a common diaryliodonium photoinitiator and initiate free&#8208;radical polymerisation (FRP) of vinylic monomers. In situ 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals an interplay between PDA&#8208;driven photosensitising and radical quenching during FRP under blue, green, and red light. This work provides crucial insights into the photoactive free radical properties of melanin&#8208;like materials and reveals a promising new application for polydopamine as a photosensitiser.

A novel method for the formation of Csp3&#8722;PIII bonds via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Umpolung carbonyls and phosphine chlorides is reported herein. This process leads to a series of alkylphosphines, which are characterized as sulfides or borane&#8208;phosphine complexes after undergoing further transformation with moderate to good yields. Invaluable free alkylphosphines can be easily obtained by desulfurization or deboration of the products. A possible mechanistic pathway is also discussed. This report represents the first example of using renewable carbonyls as latent organometallic reagent surrogates for cross&#8208;coupling with heteroatom electrophiles.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Controllable Syntheses of Covalently&#8208;Crosslinked Poly(ionic liquid) Nanoporous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, straightforward and versatile conceptual synthetic procedure capable of scalable and controllable preparation of freestanding, covalently crosslinked nanoporous poly(ionc liquid) membranes in water solution under ambient condition is developed. The resultant membranes possess remarkable thermal/solvent (e.g. salt, pH, organic solvents) stability, and exhibit excellent Li+/Mg2+ ion separation performance.







Abstract
Herein, we report an exciting synthetic procedure for the scalable and controllable fabrication of covalently crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) nanoporous membranes (CPILMs) in water solution under ambient conditions. We found that the pore sizes, flexibility and compositions of freestanding CPILMs can be finely tailored by a rational structural choice of PIL, diketone and aldehyde. Studies on the CPILM formation mechanism revealed that hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced phase separation of amino&#8208;functionalized homo&#8208;PIL between its polar and apolar domains coupled with structural rearrangements due to the Debus Radsizewski reaction&#8208;triggered ambient covalent crosslinking process created a stable three&#8208;dimensionally interconnected pore system in water solution. Employing structurally stable CPILMs in ion sieving devices resulted in an excellent Li+/Mg2+ separation efficiency due to the positively charged nature and &#8220;Donann&#8221; effects. This green, facile yet versatile approach to the production of CPILMs is a conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy for making useful nanoporous functional polyelectrolyte membranes.

         <title>Burning Graphite Faster than Carbon Black: A Case of Diffusion Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through careful control of total diffusion&#8208;limited regime, it is possible to purify carbon black at the expense of far more stable graphite. This shows that targeted exploitation of total diffusion may be used to bypass the classical chemical reactivity. This represents a new technique for materials purification or synthesis not allowed by other methods.







Abstract
External diffusion may be exploited as a tool to purify materials in a way thought to be inaccessible from a chemical reactivity point of view. A mixture of two carbonaceous materials, graphite and carbon black, are thermally oxidized in either i) outside total diffusion&#8208;limited regime or ii) total diffusion&#8208;limited regime. Depending on the treatment applied it is possible to purify either graphite, a trivial task, or carbon black, a task thought impossible. Introducing geometrical selectivity, controlled total diffusion&#8208;limited chemistry exceeds by far the field of carbon materials and can be used as an engineering tool for many materials purification, original synthesis, or to introduce asymmetry in a system. Several examples for direct applications of the findings are mentioned.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Responsive Charge&#8208;Switchable Lipid Nanoparticles for Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized four glucose&#8208;responsive cationic lipids to prepare lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low toxicity. LNP&#8208;insulin complex can be formed by electrostatic attraction. The surface positive charge of LNPs is switched off in glucose solution, leading to insulin release. In type&#8197;1 diabetic mice, LNPs can prolong the subcutaneous retention of insulin, thus doubling the duration of the normoglycemia period as compared with native insulin.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems have a profound clinical impact on nucleic acid&#8208;based therapy and vaccination. Recombinant human insulin, a negatively&#8208;charged biomolecule like mRNA, may also be delivered by rationally&#8208;designed positively&#8208;charged lipid nanoparticles with glucose&#8208;sensing elements and be released in a glucose&#8208;responsive manner. Herein, we have designed phenylboronic acid&#8208;based quaternary amine&#8208;type cationic lipids that can self&#8208;assemble into spherical lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. Upon mixing insulin and the lipid nanoparticles, a heterostructured insulin complex is formed immediately arising from the electrostatic attraction. In a hyperglycemia&#8208;relevant glucose solution, lipid nanoparticles become less positively charged over time, leading to reduced attraction and subsequent insulin release. Compared with native insulin, this lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based glucose&#8208;responsive insulin shows prolonged blood glucose regulation ability and blood glucose&#8208;triggered insulin release in a type&#8197;1 diabetic mouse model.

         <title>Upcycling of Polybutadiene Facilitated by Selenium&#8208;Mediated Allylic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling via the direct chemical functionalization of a commodity polymer is a promising strategy that introduces new value&#8208;added properties without destroying the parent backbone. This work harnesses the power of selenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization chemistry for the selective allylic amination of 1,4&#8208;polybutadiene, without alkene saturation or transposition, to tune thermal and surface wetting properties.







Abstract
Accumulation of end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics presents ongoing environmental concerns. One strategy to solve this grand challenge is to invent new techniques that modify post&#8208;consumer waste and impart new functionality. While promising approaches for the chemical upcycling of commodity polyolefins and polyaromatics exist, analogous approaches to repurpose unsaturated polymers (e.g., polybutadiene) are scarce. In this work, we propose a method to upcycle polybutadiene, one of the most widely used commercial rubbers, via a mild, metal&#8208;free allylic amination reaction. The resulting materials have tunable thermal and surface wetting properties as a function of both sulfonamide identity and grafting density. Importantly, this approach maintains the parent alkene microstructure without evidence of olefin reduction, olefin transposition, and/or chain scission. Based on these findings, we anticipate future applications in the remediation of complex elastomers and vulcanized rubbers.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Monofluorocyclohexenes through Photocatalyzed Cascade Cyclization of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes has been achieved. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and high diastereoselectivity, and the synthetic potential has been demonstrated by downstream transformations.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkenes are nonhydrolyzable mimetics of amides. Previous work focused on the synthesis of non&#8208;cyclic monofluoroalkenes. However, diastereoselective synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes from non&#8208;cyclic substrates is challenging. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization reactions of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of highly functionalized monofluorocyclohexenes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope with high diastereoselectivity (&gt;30 examples, up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).

     alt="Diastereoselective Synthesis of Monofluorocyclohexenes through Photocatalyzed Cascade Cyclization of gem-Difluoroalkenes and &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization of readily available &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes has been achieved. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and high diastereoselectivity, and the synthetic potential has been demonstrated by downstream transformations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monofluoroalkenes are nonhydrolyzable mimetics of amides. Previous work focused on the synthesis of non-cyclic monofluoroalkenes. However, diastereoselective synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes from non-cyclic substrates is challenging. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization reactions of readily available &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of highly functionalized monofluorocyclohexenes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope with high diastereoselectivity (&amp;gt;30 examples, up to 86&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The post-reaction transformations of the products demonstrate the synthetic potential of this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biased Borate Esterification during Nucleoside Phosphorylase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Apparent Equilibrium Shifts and Kinetic Implications
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biased esterification of nucleosides with borate preferentially removes those reactants from biocatalytic equilibrium systems, with the resulting cyclic borate esters acting as reversible enzyme inhibitors. This effect can be used to manipulate glycosylation equilibria and facilitate biocatalytic access to nucleoside analogues.







Abstract
Biocatalytic nucleoside (trans&#8208;)glycosylations catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylases have evolved into a practical and convenient approach to the preparation of modified nucleosides, which are important pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various cancers and viral infections. However, the obtained yields in these reactions are generally determined exclusively by the innate thermodynamic properties of the nucleosides involved, hampering the biocatalytic access to many sought&#8208;after target nucleosides. We herein report an additional means for reaction engineering of these systems. We show how apparent equilibrium shifts in phosphorolysis and glycosylation reactions can be effected through entropically driven, biased esterification of nucleosides and ribosyl phosphates with inorganic borate. Our multifaceted analysis further describes the kinetic implications of this in situ reactant esterification for a model phosphorylase.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6% and 92.2% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60 h at a current density of ~ 150 mA cm&#8208;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8208;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle&#8217;s electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report a novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst in for C&#8211;C cross&#8208;couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for electrolyzers. Here, we prove that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mucin&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Chain Polymer (MIP) Fibers as Potent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucins are the key component of the defensive mucus barrier. They are extended fibers of very high molecular weight with diverse biological functions depending strongly on their specific structural parameters. Here, we present a mucin&#8208;inspired nanostructure, produced via a synthetic methodology to prepare methacrylate&#8208;based dendronized polysulfates (MIP&#8208;1) on a multi gram scale with relatively high molecular weight (MW = 450 kDa) and thiol end&#8208;functionalized mucin&#8208;inspired polymer (MIP) via RAFT polymerization. Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis of MIP&#8208;1 confirmed a mucin&#8208;mimetic wormlike single&#8208;chain fiber structure (length = 144.5 &#177; 59.4 nm) in aqueous solution. This biocompatible fiber showed promising activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its mutant strain, with a remarkable low half maximal (IC50) inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 10.0 nM). Additionally, we investigate the impact of fiber length on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 inhibition by testing other functional polymers (MIPs) of varying fiber lengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates&#160;via&#160;synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme&#8217;s ability, we showcase herein a&#160;targeting strategy&#160;with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia Using Tiara&#8208;like Phenylethanethiolated Nickel Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fixing of N2 to NH3 is challenging due to the inertness of the N &#8801; N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process, which emits CO2&#160;while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH3 production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources. Here, we report a tiara&#8208;like nickel&#8208;thiolate cluster, [Ni6(PET)12] (where, PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol)] as an efficient electro&#8208;catalyst for the electrochemical NRR at ambient conditions. Ammonia (NH3: 16.2 &#177; 0.8 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) was the only nitrogenous product over the potential of &#9472;2.3 V vs. Fc+/Fc with a Faradic efficiency of 25 &#177; 1.7 %. Based on theoretical calculations, NRR through [Ni6(PET)12] proceeds through both the distal and alternating pathways with an onset potential of &#8211;1.84 V vs. RHE (i.e., &#8211;2.46 V vs. Fc+/Fc) which corroborates with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8211;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Microenvironment Modulation of Pd Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise in tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8208;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with 100% conversion and &gt;96% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on PdNiRuIrRh High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy by Machine Learning Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have been widely studied in electrolysis. However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25 mA &#956;g&#8208;1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability.

However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA-PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25 mA &#956;g-1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8-fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential-based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd-Pd-Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Integration of a Hydrophobic and Fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Inorganic Interphase to Stabilize Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB&#8208;ZnHCF) interphase layer is in&#8208;situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB&#8208;ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB&#8208;ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB&#8208;ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles, realizes long&#8208;term cycling over 5800 h (&gt; 8 months, 1 mA cm&#8208;2) and 1000 h (10 mA cm&#8208;2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin&#8208; and pouch&#8208;type configurations.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Air Batteries Using Dihydroxybenzoquinone and Its Polymer as the Negative Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study was conducted on an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery (SSAB) using redox&#8208;active 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DHBQ) and its polymer (PDBM) and a proton&#8208;conductive polymer (Nafion). DHBQ functioned well in the redox reaction with the solid Nafion ionomer at 0.47 and 0.57 V vs. RHE, similar to that in acid aqueous solution. The resulting air battery exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.80 V and a discharge capacity of 29.7 mAh gDHBQ&#8208;1 at a constant current density (1 mA cm&#8208;2). With PDBM, the discharge capacity was much higher, 176.1 mAh gPDBM&#8208;1, because of the improved utilization of the redox&#8208;active moieties. In the rate characteristics of the SSAB&#8208;PDBM, the coulombic efficiency was 84% at 4 C, which decreased to 66% at 101 C. In a charge/discharge cycle test, the capacity remaining after 30 cycles was 44%, which was able to be significantly improved, to 78%, by tuning the Nafion composition in the negative electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Phase Transitions of Thermotropic Glycolipid Quasicrystal and Frank&#8208;Kasper Mesophases: A Mechanistic Rosetta Stone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rich thermotropic phase map is documented for a class of versatile glycolipids that now includes dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and Frank&#8208;Kasper A15, and &#963; mesophases of tunable periodicity that are connected through rapid thermotropic phase transitions as a function of increasing temperature. This includes the first direct observation of a rapid thermotropic A15&#8594;&#963; phase transition that is proposed to proceed through a diffusionless martensitic process.







Abstract
Experimental results are presented that serve to lower the barrier for developing the science and technology of non&#8208;classical thermotropic glycolipid mesophases, which now include dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and Frank&#8211;Kasper (FK) A15 and &#963; mesophases that can be produced under mild conditions from a versatile class of sugar&#8208;polyolefin conjugates. By employing &#8220;alloys&#8221; comprised of mono&#8208; and disaccharide&#8208;polyolefin conjugates, and optionally with vitamin E as a small molecule phase modulator, we report the spontaneous formation of stable A15 mesophases at ambient temperature. We further document a rich thermotropic phase map that includes DDQC, A15, and &#963; mesophases of tunable periodicity that are connected through rapid thermotropic phase transitions as a function of increasing temperature in the order: liquid&#8208;like packing (LLP)&#8594;DDQC &#8594; A15&#8594;&#963;&#8594; disorder. This first direct observation of a rapid thermotropic A15&#8594;&#963; phase transition provides support for a diffusionless martensitic process proceeding through strain&#8208;induced introduction of planar defects into the A15 lattice.

         <title>Conformationally Controlled sp3&#8208;Hydrocarbon&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aberrant protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) in disease can be disrupted through &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics for maximum efficacy can be restrictive. Here we show that destabilising syn&#8208;pentane interactions allow substituted hydrocarbons to adopt well&#8208;defined conformations to present functional groups in a way that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix, thus allowing them to be used as scaffolds for inhibitor design.







Abstract
With over 60&#8201;% of protein&#8211;protein interfaces featuring an &#945;&#8208;helix, the use of &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics as inhibitors of these interactions is a prevalent therapeutic strategy. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics, thus enabling maximum efficacy, can be restrictive. Alternatively, conformation can be controlled through the introduction of destabilizing syn&#8208;pentane interactions. This tactic, which is often adopted by Nature, is not a common feature of lead optimization owing to the significant synthetic effort required. Through assembly&#8208;line synthesis with NMR and computational analysis, we have shown that alternating syn&#8211;anti configured contiguously substituted hydrocarbons, by avoiding syn&#8208;pentane interactions, adopt well&#8208;defined conformations that present functional groups in an arrangement that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix. The design of a p53 mimetic that binds to Mdm2 with moderate to good affinity, demonstrates the therapeutic promise of these scaffolds.

         <title>A Hemilabile NHC&#8208;Gold Complex and its Application to the Redox Neutral 1,2&#8208;Oxyarylation of Feedstock Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand mediates oxidative addition of aryl iodides to a AuI center. The oxidative addition process has been studied and analyzed computationally. This process allows the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene.







Abstract
We describe a AuI complex of a hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that is able to mediate oxidative addition of aryl iodides. Detailed computational and experimental investigations have been undertaken to verify and rationalize the oxidative addition process. Application of this initiation mode has resulted in the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene. These demanding yet powerful processes establish these commodity chemicals as nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic building blocks in catalytic reaction design.

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FENH2OH: 81.3%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FENH3: 92.3%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in&#8208;situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.</dc:description>

         <title>Frenkel Defect&#8208;modulated Anti&#8208;thermal Quenching Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Sc2(WO4)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Although large amount of effort has been invested in combating thermal quenching that severely degrades the performance of luminescent materials particularly at high temperatures, not much affirmative progress has been realized. Herein, we demonstrate that the Frenkel defect formed via controlled annealing of Sc2(WO4)3:Ln (Ln = Yb, Er, Eu, Tb, Sm), can work as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfer the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ upon heating. Therefore, except routine anti&#8208;thermal quenching, thermally enhanced 415&#8208;fold downshifting and 405&#8208;fold upconversion luminescence are even obtained in Sc2(WO4)3:Yb/Er, which has set a record of both the Yb3+&#8208;Er3+ energy transfer efficiency (&gt; 85%) and the working temperature at 500 and 1073 K, respectively. Moreover, this design strategy is extendable to other hosts possessing Frenkel defect, and modulation of which directly determines whether enhanced or decreased luminescence can be obtained. This discovery has paved new avenues to reliable generation of high&#8208;temperature luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers via Asymmetric Metal Carbene gem&#8208;Dialkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8208;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi&#8208;component reactions that build two C&#8208;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene gem&#8208;difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8208;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Conductive, Injectable, and Fluorescent Supramolecular Eutectogel Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eutectogels are an emerging family of soft ionic materials alternative to ionic liquid gels and organogels, offering fresh perspectives for designing functional dynamic platforms in water&#8208;free environments. Herein, the first example of mixed ionic and electronic conducting supramolecular eutectogel composites&#160;is reported. A fluorescent glutamic acid&#8208;derived low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was found to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrillar networks in deep eutectic solvents (DES)/ poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate dispersions. These dynamic materials displayed excellent injectability and self&#8208;healing properties, high ionic conductivity (up to 10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1), good biocompatibility, and fluorescence imaging ability. This set of features turns the mixed conducting supramolecular eutectogels into promising adaptive materials for bioimaging and electrostimulation applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A desymmetrizing silylation of axially chiral aromatic diols is reported. The previously unknown asymmetric silyl ether formation of phenol derivatives is achieved by applying List&#8217;s counteranion&#8208;directed silylation technique. A silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile generated from an allylic silane paired with an imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) enables enantioselective discrimination of atropisomeric 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols. The enantioselectivity of that desymmetrization is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, converting the monosilylated minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bissilylated diol.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Ti&#8208;S Bond Modulated S&#8208;scheme MOF/CTF Nanosheet Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic C&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing photocatalyst systems to functionalize the inert C&#8208;H bonds has attracted extensive research interest. However, purposeful modulation of interfacial charge transfer in heterostructures remains a challenge, as it usually suffers from sluggish kinetics. Reported herein is an easy strategy to construct the heteroatom&#8208;induced interface for developing the titanium&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;902) @ thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with controllable oxygen vacancies (OVs). Specifically, Ti atoms were first anchored onto the heteroatom site of CTF&#8208;Th nanosheets, and then grown into MOF&#8208;902 via an interfacial Ti&#8208;S linkage, generating OVs. Using in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced interfacial charge separation and transfer induced by moderate OVs in the pre&#8208;designed S&#8208;scheme nanosheets was validated. The heterostructures exhibited an improved efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles under mild conditions with a yield 8.2 times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902 and enabled an extended scope of substrates (15 examples). This performance is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalyst and can be retained, without significant loss, after 12 consecutive cycles.</dc:description>

Reported herein is an easy strategy to construct the heteroatom-induced interface for developing the titanium-organic frameworks (MOF-902) @ thiophene-based covalent triazine frameworks (CTF-Th) nanosheets S-scheme heterojunctions with controllable oxygen vacancies (OVs). Specifically, Ti atoms were first anchored onto the heteroatom site of CTF-Th nanosheets, and then grown into MOF-902 via an interfacial Ti-S linkage, generating OVs. Using in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced interfacial charge separation and transfer induced by moderate OVs in the pre-designed S-scheme nanosheets was validated. The heterostructures exhibited an improved efficiency in photocatalytic C3-acylation of indoles under mild conditions with a yield 8.2 times larger than pristine CTF-Th or MOF-902 and enabled an extended scope of substrates (15 examples). This performance is superior to state-of-the-art photocatalyst and can be retained, without significant loss, after 12 consecutive cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uncovering Dynamic Edge&#8208;Sites in Atomic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Electrocatalyst for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding of the nature of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and identification of their spectroscopic fingerprints are essential prerequisites for the rational design of target catalysts. Here, we apply correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy to probe the edge&#8208;site&#8208;specific chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) operation. The unique edge&#8208;hosted architecture affords single&#8208;atom Co site remarkable structural flexibility with adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8208;&#948;)+ and Co2+, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8208;Nx counterpart. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic interplay of in&#8208;situ reconstructed Co1&#8208;N2&#8208;oxo with peripheral oxygen groups gives rise to a near&#8208;optimal adsorption of *OOH intermediate and substantially increases the activation barrier for its dissociation, accounting for a robust acidic ORR activity and 2e&#8208; selectivity for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods via boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are much underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals via photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids via radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggested that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals were generated via single electron transfer of the photoactive charge transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8722;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8722;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665 mA cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700 h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of ~88% at 365 mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0 &#197; &#215; 4.8 &#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type All&#8208;Inorganic Heterometallic Nanoclusters: Record High&#8208;Nuclearity Cobalt Polyoxoniobates for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only rarely have polyoxometalates been found to form core&#8208;shell nanoclusters. Here, we succeeded in isolating a series of rare giant and all&#8208;inorganic core&#8208;shell cobalt polyoxoniobates (Co&#8208;PONbs) with diverse shapes, nuclearities and original topologies, including 50&#8208;nuclearity {Co12Nb38O132}, 54&#8208;nuclearity {Co20Nb34O128}, 62&#8208;nuclearity {Co26Nb36O140} and 87&#8208;nuclearity {Co33Nb54O128}. They are the largest Co&#8208;PONbs and also the polyoxometalates containing the greatest number of Co ions and the largest cobalt clusters known thus far. These molecular Co&#8208;PONbs have intriguing and atomically precise core&#8208;shell architectures comprising unique cobalt oxide cores and niobate oxide shells. In particular, the encapsulated cobalt oxide cores with different nuclearities have identical compositions, structures and mixed&#8208;valence Co3+/Co2+ states as the different sized Co&#8208;O moieties of the bulk cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4, suggesting that they can serve as various molecular models of the cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. The successful construction of the series of the Co&#8208;PONbs reveals a feasible and versatile synthetic method for making rare core&#8208;shell heterometallic PONbs. Further, these new&#8208;type core&#8208;shell bimetal species are promising cluster molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH 5.5 buffer.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues with Optimized Crystal Plane Orientation and Low Crystal Defects toward 450 Wh kg&#8208;1 Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical energy density and low&#8208;cost. However, high water and vacancies content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large&#8208;scale application in SIBs. Herein, a facile &#8220;potassium&#8208;ions assisted&#8221; strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs exhibits increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to ~450 Wh kg&#8208;1, which is at the same level of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution and redox&#8208;active pairs were identified by multiple in&#8208;situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the designing of safe SIBs with high energy density.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Polymer as Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#160;metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes.&#160;Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named&#160;P(St&#8208;MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in&#8208;situ&#160;form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li&#160;dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St&#8208;MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900 h under 1 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO4&#160;full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes.&#160;The innovative strategy of artificial&#160;SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Electroluminescent Material: Lengthening Emission Maximum and Shortening Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are considered a class of organic materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, which make them promising for the applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we improved, synthesized, and characterized a multiple&#8208;resonance type emitter based on the assembly of MR&#8208;building blocks (MR&#8208;BBs). By optimizing the geometric arrangement of MR&#8208;BBs, we were able to generate narrowband emission in the longer wavelength region and shorten the delayed excited&#8208;state lifetime, resulting in improved emission efficiency compared to the parent molecule. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule, m&#8208;DBCz, exhibited narrowband yellowish&#8208;green TADF emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 32 nm and a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 0.04 eV. The OLED developed using m&#8208;DBCz as the emitter demonstrated electroluminescence at 548 nm and achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.9%. Further optimization of the device resulted in a high external quantum efficiency of 36.3% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE values of 30.1% and 27.7% obtained even at high luminance levels of 50000 and 100000 cd m&#8722;2. These results demonstrate the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF materials for applications on ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Performance of Cobalt Oxide by Protic Ionic Liquid Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is an appealing way for small&#8208;scale and decentralized ammonia synthesis and waste nitrate treatment. Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500 ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4&#8208;x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23 &#177; 4.97 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and 84.74 &#177; 3.43% at &#8208;1.71 and &#8208;1.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4&#8208;x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8208; as well as the NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thioamide peptides were synthesized via a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that trichlorosilane enabled the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8211;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded thioamide peptides. The potential applications for thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a new strategy in which a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster can be doped with open d&#8208;shell group 8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Ir) metals by forming metal hydride (RuH2, OsH2, IrH) superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. Structural analyses using various experimental and theoretical methods revealed that the Ag25 nanoclusters were co&#8208;doped with the open d&#8208;shell metal and hydride species to produce superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters, establishing a novel superatom doping phenomenon for open d&#8208;shell metals. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Comparative PL lifetime studies of the Ag25 nanoclusters doped with 8&#8211;10 group metals revealed that both radiative and nonradiative processes were significantly dependent on the dopant. The former is strongly correlated with the electron affinity of the metal dopant, whereas the latter is governed predominantly by the kernel structure changed upon the doping of the metal hydride(s).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Local Charge Distribution in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the electronic structure of covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts is essential for maximizing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report an isoreticular family of&#160;multivariate&#160;COFs&#160;containing chromenoquinoline rings in the COF structure and electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups in the pores.&#160;Intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions in the COFs allowed tuning of local charge distributions&#160;and charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. By optimizing the optoelectronic properties of the COFs, a photocatalytic uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02 mg/g/day was achieved using a nitro&#8208;functionalized multicomponent COF in natural seawater, exceeding the performance of all COFs reported to date.&#160;Results demonstrate an effective design strategy towards high&#8208;activity COF photocatalysts with intramolecular D&#8208;A structures not easily accessible using traditional synthetic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Linkage Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To achieve high activity and selectivity, various building blocks containing heteroatoms and groups linked by imine bonds were used to create catalytic COFs. However, the roles of linkages of COFs in ORR have not been investigated. In this work, catalytic linkage engineering has been employed to modulate the catalytic behaviors. To create single catalytic sites while avoiding other possible catalytic sites, we synthesized COFs from benzene units linked by various bonds, such as imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds. Among these COFs, the oxazole&#8208;linkage in COFs enables to catalyze the ORR with the highest activity, which achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.75 V and a limited current density of 5.5 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the oxazole&#8208;linked COF achieved a conversion frequency (TOF) value of 0.0133 S&#8722;1, which were 1.9, 1.3, and 7.4&#8208;times that of azine&#8208;, amide&#8208; and imine&#8208;COFs, respectively. The theoretical calculation showed that the carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the form of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form the OH*, thus advancing the catalytic activity. This work guides us on which linkages in COFs are suitable for ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO Mediated by Silver Single Atoms Anchored on Tubular Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into fuels and value&#8208;added chemical products. However, a photocatalyst is usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, we develop the Ag single atoms anchored hollow porous polygonal tubular C3N4 (PCN) photocatalyst Ag1@PCN with an Ag&#8208;N3coordination for CO2 photoreduction using H2O as the reductant. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag1@PCNexhibits a high CO production rate of 0.32 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 (mass of catalyst: 2 mg), a high selectivity (&gt;94%), and an excellent stability in the long term of photocatalytic reaction. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) analyses elucidate that the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (Ag&#8208;N3) not only favors *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, but also accelerates the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers between C3N4 and Ag single atoms, thereby accounting for the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity with a high CO selectivity. This work provides a deep insight into the important role of strong metal&#8208;support interaction in enhancing the photoactivity and CO selectivity of CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Observing Confined Local Oxygen&#8208;induced Reversible Thiol/Disulfide Cycle with a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide bonds play an important role in thiol&#8208;based redox regulation. However, owing to the lack of analytical tools, little is known about how local O2 mediates the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement. In this study, a protein nanopore reactor inside a glove box is developed for O2 confinement, as well as a single&#8208;molecule sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle. The results demonstrate that the presence of local O2 molecules in protein nanopores can facilitate the redox cycle of disulfide formation and cleavage by promoting a higher fraction of effective reactant collisions owing to nanoconfinement. Further kinetic calculations indicate that negatively charged residues near the reactive sites facilitate proton&#8208;involved, oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O2 may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Excited State Trajectories on Potential Energy Surfaces with Atomic Resolution in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcited molecular trajectories on the potential energy surfaces prior to thermalization are intimately connected to the photochemical reaction outcome. The excited state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8208;metal &#120590;&#8208;bond formation and associated Pt&#8208;Pt stretching motions were detected in real time using femtosecond wide angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. The observed motions correspond well with coherent vibrational wavepacket motions detected by femtosecond optical transient absorption. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing have been identified, the Pt&#8208;Pt bond distance and the orientation of the ligands coordinated with the platinum centers, along which the excited state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated potential energy surfaces of the excited states. This investigation has gleaned novel insight into electronic transitions occurring on the time scales of vibrational motions measured in real time, revealing ultrafast nonadiabatic or non&#8208;equilibrium processes along excited state trajectories involving multiple excited state potential energy surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Apolipoprotein&#8197;E Recognizes Alzheimer's Disease Associated 3&#8208;O Sulfation of Heparan Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE) with cell surface Heparan Sulfate (HS) is enhanced by a rare, Alzheimer's Disease linked 3&#8208;O&#8208;Sulfo group. This binding motif is shared with tau protein, suggesting a mechanism for ApoE/tau interactions in the association of certain ApoE isoforms with AD.







Abstract
Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE)&#8217;s &#1013;4 alle is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cell&#8208;surface heparan sulfate (HS) is a cofactor for ApoE/LRP1 interaction and the prion&#8208;like spread of tau pathology between cells. 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfo (3&#8208;O&#8208;S) modification of HS has been linked to AD through its interaction with tau, and enhanced levels of 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS and 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfotransferases in the AD brain. In this study, we characterized ApoE/HS interactions in wildtype ApoE3, AD&#8208;linked ApoE4, and AD&#8208;protective ApoE2 and ApoE3&#8208;Christchurch. Glycan microarray and SPR assays revealed that all ApoE isoforms recognized 3&#8208;O&#8208;S. NMR titration localized ApoE/3&#8208;O&#8208;S binding to the vicinity of the canonical HS binding motif. In cells, the knockout of HS3ST1&#8208;a major 3&#8208;O sulfotransferase&#8208;reduced cell surface binding and uptake of ApoE. 3&#8208;O&#8208;S is thus recognized by both tau and ApoE, suggesting that the interplay between 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS, tau and ApoE isoforms may modulate AD risk.

         <title>Formation and Loading of a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;Ethylmalonamyl Starter Unit in the Assembly Line of Polyketide&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Hybrid Sanglifehrin A</title>

         <dc:description>
The process for forming and loading a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl starter unit in the assembly line of sanglifehrin A is uncovered. This process involves two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP): an amide synthetase catalyzes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl amidation, and a homolog of &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl onto the assembly line to prime the biosynthesis of sanglifehrin A.







Abstract
Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a spirolactam&#8208;conjugated, 22&#8208;membered macrolide with remarkable immunosuppressive and antiviral activities. This macrolide is a result of a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line that utilizes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl as a starter unit. Here, we report that the formation and loading of this starter unit in the SFA assembly line involve two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), SfaO. An amide synthetase, SfaP, catalyzes the amidation of (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl in a SfaO&#8208;dependent manner. Then, a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III&#8208;like protein, SfaN, transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl from SfaO onto the loading ACP domain of the hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS assembly line to prime SFA biosynthesis. Both SfaP and SfaN display promiscuous activities. This study furthers the appreciation of assembly line chemistry, as a new paradigm for unusual building block formation and incorporation is provided.

         <title>Inducing Covalent Atomic Interaction in Intermetallic Pt Alloy Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing covalent interaction bonding between Pt and Ga atoms, the developed L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C ORR catalyst shows efficient and stable performance in practical fuel cells. This work may provide a new strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts via tuning the type of chemical bonds for electrochemical energy conversion.







Abstract
The harsh working environments of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) pose huge challenges to the stability of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts. The widespread presence of metallic bonds with significantly delocalized electron distribution often lead to component segregation and rapid performance decay. Here we report L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticles with a unique covalent atomic interaction between Pt&#8722;Ga as high&#8208;performance PEMFC cathode catalysts. The L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C catalyst shows superb oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in fuel cell cathode (mass activity=0.57&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=2.60/1.24&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2/air, 28&#8197;mV voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates via the formed biaxial strain on L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa surface, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger Pt&#8722;M bonds than those in L11&#8722;PtCu resulted from Pt&#8722;Ga covalent interactions.

         <title>Molecule Saturation Boosts Acetylene Semihydrogenation Activity and Selectivity on a Core&#8208;Shell Ruthenium@Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for semihydrogenation of acetylene was created by layering Pd on large Ru nanoparticles with terrace sites and a smaller lattice constant. The catalyst stabilizes unsaturated acetylene as it undergoes semihydrogenation while promoting ethylene desorption, thereby achieving high activity and selectivity at the same time.







Abstract
Increasing selectivity without the expense of activity is desired but challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. By revealing the molecule saturation and adsorption sensitivity on overlayer thickness, strain, and coordination of Pd&#8208;based catalysts from first&#8208;principles calculations, we designed a stable Pd monolayer (ML) catalyst on a Ru terrace to boost both activity and selectivity of acetylene semihydrogenation. The least saturated molecule is most sensitive to the change in catalyst electronic and geometric properties. By simultaneously compressing the Pd ML and exposing the high coordination sites, the adsorption of more saturated ethylene is considerably weakened to facilitate the desorption for high selectivity. The even stronger weakening to the least saturated acetylene drives its hydrogenation such that it is more exothermic, thereby boosting the activity. Tailoring the molecule saturation and its sensitivity to structure and composition provides a tool for rational design of efficient catalysts.

         <title>A Fused [5]Helicene Dimer with a Figure&#8208;Eight Topology: Synthesis, Chiral Resolution, and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by a Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of a vinyl ether has led to the synthesis of a fused [5]helicene dimer with a figure&#8208;eight geometry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The fully conjugated electronic structure and D2 symmetry results in the isolated enantiomers showing persistent chirality and large dissymmetric factors.







Abstract
Chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double&#8208;stranded figure&#8208;eight carbon nanobelt 1 in which two [5]helicene units are fused together. Two synthetic routes were developed, and, in particular, a strategy involving Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ether turned out to be the most efficient. The structure of 1 was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The isolated (P,P)&#8208; and (M,M)&#8208; enantiomers show persistent chiroptical properties with relatively large dissymmetric factors (|gabs|=5.4&#215;10&#8722;3 and |glum|=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2), which can be explained by the effective electron delocalization along the fully conjugated belt and the unique D2 symmetry. 1 exhibits local aromatic character with a dominant structure containing eight Clar's aromatic sextet rings.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;triggered Carbon Monoxide and Manganese Dioxide Generation based on Scintillating Nanoparticles for Cascade Cancer Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide and manganese dioxide generation nanocomposites were fabricated with UV&#8208;responsive manganese carbonyl and radioluminescent scintillating nanoparticles. The glycolytic inhibition of carbon monoxide, coupled with the Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like activity of manganese dioxide, greatly boost the effect of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with broad therapeutic effects. Here, a multifunctional X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide (CO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) generation nanoplatform based on metal carbonyl and scintillating nanoparticles (SCNPs) is reported. Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV&#8208;responsive Mn2(CO)10 is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X&#8208;ray but can also be degraded into MnO2. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO2, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn2(CO)10, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton&#8208;like Mn2+ delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8901;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated Mn2+ in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.

Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV-responsive Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X-ray but can also be degraded into MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton-like Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X-ray-activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8901;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X-ray-activated Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Indenyl Effect: Accelerated C&#8722;H Amidation of Arenes via Ind*RhIII Nitrene Transfer Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl silane directed C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes via nitrene transfer catalysis using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones as the N&#8208;donor source was significantly accelerated in the presence of a heptamethylindenyl&#8208;rhodium catalyst (Ind*RhIII).







Abstract
Investigations into C&#8722;H amidation reactions catalysed by cationic half&#8208;sandwich d6 metal complexes revealed that the indenyl&#8208;derived catalyst [Ind*RhCl2]2 significantly accelerated the directed ortho C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. Ring slippage involving a haptotropic &#951;5 to &#951;3 rearrangement of the indenyl complex proposedly enables ligand substitution at the metal centre to proceed via associative, rather than dissociative pathways, leading to significant rate and yield enhancements. Intriguingly, this phenomenon appears specific for C&#8722;H amidation reactions involving weakly coordinating carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups with no acceleration observed for the corresponding reactions involving strongly coordinating nitrogen&#8208;based directing groups.

         <title>A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst was made from demethylated lignin as sustainable source and Fe3O4. It can be used in environmental sciences to clean wastewater and in material sciences as a radical photoinitiator, resulting in crosslinking of vinyl monomers by radical photopolymerization. Films obtained showed good water repelling and no tackiness even in an aerobic surrounding.







Abstract
A sustainable photocatalyst for use with multiple purpose comprising demethylated lignin (Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood) was made by treatment of wood and iron oxide. Characterization followed by XRD, UV/Vis, photo&#8208;current studies, and electrochemical measurements. This material became subject of photocatalytic explorations for water treatment and material synthesis by radical photopolymerization. Exposure of Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood with artificial sunlight showed an improved activity considering photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2O2. The efficient generation of reactive radicals brought this system also to photopolymerization. Here, radicals based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the catalytic cycle can be seen as the dominating species to initiate radical polymerization. A mixture of UDMA and TPGDA showed good reactivity with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Photocatalyst used for water treatment facilitates reuse for photopolymerization.

         <title>Unveiling the Critical Role of Ion Coordination Configuration of Ether Electrolytes for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ether solvent (1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane, DMP) is used for the configuration of the electrochemical behavior of electrolytes in lithium metal batteris. The six&#8208;membered Li+&#8208;chelating ring greatly improves the oxidation stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolyte compared to the conventional five&#8208;membered chelate ring. The cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase enriched in LiF effectively protects the nickel&#8208;rich cathode from corrosion by electrolyte side reactions.







Abstract
Albeit ethers are favorable electrolyte solvents for lithium (Li) metal anode, their inferior oxidation stability (&lt;4.0&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) is problematic for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Studies of ether electrolytes have been focusing on the archetype glyme structure with ethylene oxide moieties. Herein, we unveil the crucial effect of ion coordination configuration on oxidation stability by varying the ether backbone structure. The designed 1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane (DMP, C3) forms a unique six&#8208;membered chelating complex with Li+, whose stronger solvating ability suppresses oxidation side reactions. In addition, the favored hydrogen transfer reaction between C3 and anion induces a dramatic enrichment of LiF (a total atomic ratio of 76.7&#8201;%) on the cathode surface. As a result, the C3&#8208;based electrolyte enables greatly improved cycling of nickel&#8208;rich cathodes under 4.7&#8197;V. This study offers fundamental insights into rational electrolyte design for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Crystallinity Regulation and Defects Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones with high specific surface area and excellent stability. The PAFs were successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer, and the power conversion efficiencies and stability significantly increased.







Abstract
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) have been constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones, high specific surface area, and excellent stability. The prepared PAF&#8208;154 and PAF&#8208;155 have been successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer. The champion PSC devices afford a power conversion efficiency of 22.8&#8201;% and 22.4&#8201;%. It is found that the PAFs can be used as an efficient nucleation template, thus regulating the perovskite crystallinity. Meanwhile, PAFs can also passivate defects and promote carriers transporting in the perovskite film. By the comparative study with their linear counterpart, we unravel that the efficacy of PAFs is highly related to their porous structure and rigid fully conjugated networks. The unencapsulated devices with PAFs doping exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after half&#8208;year storage in ambient conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site Conformational Exchange in the Synthetic Neomycin&#8208;Sensing Riboswitch Studied by 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions are tightly coupled with function. Here we use a unique combination of five different fluorine NMR relaxation methods to reveal the dynamics in three structurally similar riboswitch:ligand complexes. Our data displays unexpectedly complex exchange topologies with up to four structurally different states. Importantly, the associated kinetic and thermodynamics parameters could be accurately determined.







Abstract
The synthetic neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch interacts with its cognate ligand neomycin as well as with the related antibiotics ribostamycin and paromomycin. Binding of these aminoglycosides induces a very similar ground state structure in the RNA, however, only neomycin can efficiently repress translation initiation. The molecular origin of these differences has been traced back to differences in the dynamics of the ligand:riboswitch complexes. Here, we combine five complementary fluorine based NMR methods to accurately quantify seconds to microseconds dynamics in the three riboswitch complexes. Our data reveal complex exchange processes with up to four structurally different states. We interpret our findings in a model that shows an interplay between different chemical groups in the antibiotics and specific bases in the riboswitch. More generally, our data underscore the potential of 19F NMR methods to characterize complex exchange processes with multiple excited states.

More generally, our data underscore the potential of &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR methods to characterize complex exchange processes with multiple excited states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure, have been achieved for the first time in a divergent manner. Key features of the strategy involve a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation, a one&#8208;pot borylation/conjugate addition process, a Wolff ring contraction and a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization.







Abstract
The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare and highly oxygenated [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure that were isolated from P. vulgaris Linn., have been described for the first time in a divergent manner. Key transformations include: 1) a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation to forge the A ring bearing desired stereochemistry at C14; 2) a one&#8208;pot borylation/conjugate addition process for creation of the C1&#8722;C11 bond; 3) a Wolff ring contraction to assemble the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane subunit (CD rings); and 4) a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization for construction of the central B ring of the natural products.

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen powder is pre&#8208;melted and resolidified to give a stable chalcogen precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of transition metal dichalcogenides. The obtained monolayer tungsten disulfide is uniform and shows high optical and structural quality.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6&#177;1.9&#8197;meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9&#177;3)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2 and (10&#177;4)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells by a Multifunctional Composite Photoanode to 14.13&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres, Au nanoparticles and upconversion nanoparticles is presented. A champion power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
We report a new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres (TiO2&#8208;HSs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and novel NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Er@NaLuF4&#8201;:&#8201;Eu@SiO2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The AuNPs are grown on the photoanode film including TiO2&#8208;HSs and UCNPs by a simple in situ plasmonic treatment. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, demonstrating great potential for the solar cells toward commercialization. This obvious enhancement is ascribed to a collaborative mechanism of the TiO2&#8208;HSs exhibiting excellent light&#8208;scattering ability, of the UCNPs converting near&#8208;infrared photons into visible photons and of the AuNPs presenting outstanding surface plasmon resonance effect. Notably, a steady&#8208;state experiment further reveals that the champion cell exhibits 95.33&#8201;% retainment in efficiency even after 180&#8197;h of measurements, showing good device stability.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Arylpyrroles via Atroposelective Diyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization enables the efficient synthesis of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. This method gives the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers and the first atroposelective diyne cyclization.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls widely exist in natural products and pharmaceuticals and are used as chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Compared to the well&#8208;established axially chiral 6&#8208;membered biaryl skeletons, examples of 5&#8208;membered biaryls have been quite scarce, and mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers have not been reported. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization for the construction of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers, but also constitutes the first example of atroposelective diyne cyclization and the first atropisomer construction via vinyl cations. Theoretical calculations further support the mechanism of vinyl cation&#8208;involved cyclization and elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane via Regulating Methyl Intermediates over Metal/ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO has been investigated for photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane, among which Au/ZnO exhibited a C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 83&#8201;% selectivity. Photogenerated methyl active groups can be selectively coupled on Au but tend to be over&#8208;oxidized into CO2 on other transition metals mainly because of the deference in *CH3&#8208;metal interaction.







Abstract
Methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons requires harsh reaction conditions due to high energy barriers associated with C&#8722;H bond activation. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (83&#8201;% C2&#8208;C4 selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8722;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn+&#8208;O&#8722; sites enable CH4 activation to methyl intermediates (*CH3) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH3&#8208;metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d&#8208;&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal&#8208;C&#8722;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d&#8208;&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.

Photogenerated methyl active groups can be selectively coupled on Au but tend to be over-oxidized into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on other transition metals mainly because of the deference in *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-metal interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons requires harsh reaction conditions due to high energy barriers associated with C&#8722;H bond activation. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition-metal-loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (83&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8722;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; sites enable CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation to methyl intermediates (*CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d-&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal-C&#8722;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d-&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Traffic Lights for Catalysis: Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular and Extended Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as flowers blooming in response to the sun attract bees to continue their natural life cycle, molecules which respond to external stimuli can be used to control catalytic cycles. Development of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular and extended catalytic platforms is a pathway for precise tuning of reaction yield, rate, or enantioselectivity that could pave the way for the next era of sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Highly Active Hydrogen&#8208;rich Photothermal Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction on Ni/LaInO3 Perovskite Catalysts with Near&#8208;unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni/LaInO3 was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal CO2 conversion with a high CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity, where LaInO3 was enriched extensive oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway and the photoinduced charge transfer process to reduce the reaction active energy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is regarded green and promising in controlling the reaction gas ratio in Fischer Tropsch synthesis. But it is inclined to produce more byproducts in high H2 concentration condition. Herein, LaInO3 loaded with Ni&#8208;nanoparticles (Ni NPs) was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal RWGS reaction rate, where LaInO3 was enriched with oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni NPs endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. The optimized catalyst performed a large CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway of the reaction and photoinduced charge transfer process for reducing the RWGS reaction active energy. Our work provides valuable insights on the construction of catalysts concerning products selectivity and photoelectronic activating mechanism on CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Enables Polymer Hydrogels with pH&#8208;Induced Reversible Dynamic Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pH&#8208;induced alteration of hydrogen bonds, when placed in an acid solution, the transparent PAN hydrogel quickly becomes opaque and then gradually regains its transparency; while after being switched into DI water, the same dynamic response of fast transparency drop followed by spontaneous slow recovery is recreated.







Abstract
Poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PAN) hydrogels containing multiple hydrogen bonds can exhibit pH&#8208;induced reversible dynamic responsive behaviors. When placing a transparent hydrogel in an acid bath, as hydrogen bonds between comonomer units involving protonated COOH groups are formed faster than water diffusion, a nonequilibrium light&#8208;scattering state is formed to turn the hydrogel opaque, while as the swelling equilibrium is reached over time, the hydrogel regains its transparency. Likewise, when the transparent, hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrogel is subsequently immersed in DI water, faster water absorption occurs in where more COOH groups are deprotonated, which also generates a light&#8208;scattering state leading to opacity, while the transparency is slowly recovered after equilibrium. Using such two&#8208;way dynamic transparency evolution, a PAN&#8208;based hydrogel material is prepared to demonstrate a dynamic memory system for information memorizing&#8208;forgetting and recalling&#8208;forgetting.

         <title>Phenazine&#8208;based Compound Realizing Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Production in Electrolytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Phenazine&#8208;based electrode is used as a solid&#8208;state redox mediator to decouple the H2 and O2 production in acidic water electrolysis, realizing a membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, conventional water electrolysis may suffer from gas mixing, and the different kinetics between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will limit the direct use of unstable renewable energies, leading to increased cost of H2 production. Herein, a novel phenazine&#8208;based compound is synthesized to develop the solid&#8208;state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (3000&#8197;cycles) due to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high&#8208;purity H2 production at different times.

Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent rate performance (186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and long cycle life (3000&#8197;cycles) due to its &#960;-conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane-free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high-purity H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at different times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8208;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3% with an energy efficiency of 27% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8208;0.615 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8208;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.</dc:description>

Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self-supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3% with an energy efficiency of 27% at a low working-potential of -0.615 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C-C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*-to-*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol.

         <title>I3&#8722;/I&#8722; Redox Reaction&#8208;mediated Organic Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with Accelerated Kinetics and Long Shelf Lives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The storage time of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) for practical implementation has been neglected long&#8208;lastingly. ZABs based on organic solvents promise long storage time but suffer from sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a longly storable ZAB with enhanced kinetics mediated by iodine&#8208;containing redox. In the charge process, the electrooxidation of Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O is accelerated by I3&#8208; chemical oxidation. In the discharge process, I&#8208; adsorbed on the electrocatalyst changes the energy level of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefitting from these advantages, the prepared ZAB shows remarkably improved round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.03% vs. 30.97% without the mediator), and long&#8208;term cycling time (&gt;2600 h) in ambient air without replacing any components or applying any protective treatment to Zn anode and electrocatalyst. After resting for 30 days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5 h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200 h (440 cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25 h, and 50/25 h (10/5 cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep learning is revolutionizing structural biology to an unprecedented extent. Spearheaded by DeepMind&#8217;s Alphafold2, structural models of often high quality can be generated, and are now available for most known proteins, as well as many protein interactions. The next challenge will be to leverage this rich structural corpus to learn about binding: which protein can contact which partners, and at what affinity? In a recent study, Chang and Perez have presented an elegant approach towards this challenging goal, for interactions that involve a short peptide binding to its receptor. The basic idea is straightforward: given a receptor that binds to two peptides, if the receptor sequence is presented with both peptides together at the same time, AlphaFold2 should model the tighter binding peptide into the binding site, while excluding the second. A simple idea that works!</dc:description>

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has been steadily showcasing examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both laboratory and preparative scales. Given the yet unstandardised nature of mechanochemical processes compared to solution&#8208;based chemistry, scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this review is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Lactam Electrophiles for Covalent Chemical Biology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic groups are one of the key pillars of contemporary chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For instance, the group of 3&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds &#8211; such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines &#8211; possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The &#945;&#8208;lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an &#945;&#8208;lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases 1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo&#8208; and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, our study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of &#945;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O&#160;bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to&#160;assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to&#160;the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at&#160;silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive&#160;experimental and computational account on the reaction of&#160;trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid&#160;exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects&#160;are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of&#160;sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the&#160;obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future&#160;applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in&#160;drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc, whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying the short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Free Amino Group Transfer via &#945;&#8208;Amination of Native Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a straightforward transfer of a free amino group (NH2) from a commercially available nitrogen source to unfunctionalized, native carbonyls (amides and ketones) resulting in direct &#945;&#8208;amination. Primary &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls are readily produced under mild conditions, further enabling diverse in&#8208;situ functionalization reactions&#8212;including peptide coupling and Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization&#8212;that capitalize on the presence of the unprotected primary amine.</dc:description>
