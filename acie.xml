         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures have remained elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of a cyclic AIP (cAIP) that controls endospore formation in  Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum  . Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with mutant strain, we reveal that a homodetic cyclopeptide is the genuine chemical mediator. Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid  S  &#8594;  N  shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial cAIPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Polyfunctional Triarylmethanes and 1,1&#8208;Diarylalkanes by Sequential Cross&#8208;Coupling of Benzal Diacetates with Organozinc Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of functionalized triarylmethane and 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane derivatives were prepared via a transition metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot and two&#8208;step procedure, involving the reaction of various benzal diacetates with organozinc reagents. A sequential cross&#8208;coupling is enabled by changing the solvent from THF to toluene, and a two&#8208;step S  N  1&#8208;type mechanism was proposed and evidenced by experimental study. The synthetic utility of the method is further demonstrated by the synthesis of several biologically relevant molecules, such as an anti&#8208;tuberculosis agent, an anti&#8208;breast cancer agent, a precursor of a sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, and a FLAP inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controllable Catalysis and Chiral Monosaccharide Recognition Induced by Cyclodextrin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assemblies composed of polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and gold nanoparticles realize photo&#8208;controlled catalytic processes via host&#8211;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine. The polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity is able to recognize chiral monosaccharides, thereby achieving unprecedented selective oxidative catalytic performance.







Abstract
A supramolecular catalytic system was constructed from polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP) using a supramolecular assembly strategy. The cavity of cyclodextrin is the channel by which the substrate molecules come into contact with the catalytic center. Introduction of the azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (Azo&#8208;FF) guest molecule allowed for precise photo&#8208;control of the catalytic activity owing to its sensitive response to irradiation. Importantly, as a unique glucose oxidase the AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD realizes unprecedented chiral recognition catalysis for chiral monosaccharides. In combination with a 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) color reaction, AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD is able to recognize the chirality of various monosaccharides.

         <title>Anomalous Cis&#8208;Conformation Regioselectivity of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 was reacted with carbonyl ylide to form two isomeric monoadducts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b bearing anomalous cis&#8208;conformation regioselectivity and a [6,6]&#8208;closed addition pattern. Whereas isomeric monoadducts 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b with cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;conformations were produced simultaneously for C60 under the same conditions. Adduct stability, reactivity of the addition site, and the nature of intermediates play a role in the different regioselectivity.







Abstract
Endohedral clusterfullerenes exhibit unique chemical properties due to intramolecular electron transfer of the encaged metal cluster to the outer fullerene cages. We report the synthesis of two Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 monoadducts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction of Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 with carbonyl ylide bearing anomalous cis&#8208;conformation regioselectivity. The molecular structures of these monoadducts are unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, revealing that both 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b have cis&#8208;conformations with the furan moiety grafted via [6,6]&#8208;closed addition patterns. Under the same conditions, the control reaction of C60 with carbonyl ylide affords two monoadducts 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b, which exhibit cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;conformations, respectively, with [6,6]&#8208;closed addition patterns. According to theoretical calculations, the exclusive formation of the cis&#8208;only Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 monoadducts is a consequence of conjunct effects of thermodynamic stability of adducts, the reactivity of the addition site, and the cis&#8208;dipole intermediate from trans 1.

         <title>Electrochemically Triggered Chain Reactions for the Conversion of Furan Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method is developed to enable electrochemically triggered chain reactions for the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuel additives. Only 2&#8201;% equivalent charges are consumed, yielding an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;% in terms of hydrocarbon products, whereas the only byproduct is H2 at the cathode. The reaction shows no sensitivity to oxygen from ambient air; trace amounts of water facilitate the reaction by stabilizing a key intermediate.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical method for coupling biomass&#8208;derived C5/C6 compounds to value&#8208;added fuel precursors. Using only 2&#8201;% of equivalent charges, 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF) was oxidized to yield a cation radical, which readily reacted with 3&#8208;hexene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, a derivate of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran, to produce 3&#8208;(5&#8208;methylfuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)hexane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione. The product was converted to 4&#8208;ethylnonane (a component of biodiesel/jet fuel) in a single step in excellent yield. Importantly, the reaction was not sensitive to oxygen, and a trace amount of water was found to promote the reaction. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed the proposed reaction pathways. Key to the mechanism is the radical generation that is enabled by electrochemistry. The radical is regenerated at the end of a reaction cycle to ensure chain propagation for an average of ca. 47 times, resulting in an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;%.

Using only 2&#8201;% of equivalent charges, 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF) was oxidized to yield a cation radical, which readily reacted with 3&#8208;hexene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, a derivate of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran, to produce 3&#8208;(5&#8208;methylfuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)hexane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione. The product was converted to 4&#8208;ethylnonane (a component of biodiesel/jet fuel) in a single step in excellent yield. Importantly, the reaction was not sensitive to oxygen, and a trace amount of water was found to promote the reaction. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed the proposed reaction pathways. Key to the mechanism is the radical generation that is enabled by electrochemistry. The radical is regenerated at the end of a reaction cycle to ensure chain propagation for an average of ca. 47 times, resulting in an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cooperative Syngas Production and C&#8722;N Bond Formation in One Photoredox Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A function&#8208;oriented strategy of engineering black phosphorus quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn2S4 heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with selectively oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, in one redox cycle is reported. The promoted charge&#8208;carrier separation, enriched active sites and optimized adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates for CO2 reduction, as well as the cooperative photoredox manner, jointly contribute to the enhanced photoactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven syngas production by CO2 reduction provides a sustainable strategy to produce renewable feedstocks. However, this promising reaction often suffers from tough CO2 activation, sluggish oxidative half&#8208;reaction kinetics and undesired by&#8208;products. Herein, we report a function&#8208;oriented strategy of deliberately constructing black phosphorus quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn2S4 (BP/ZIS) heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with selectively oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, in one redox cycle. The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production with a tunable ratio of CO/H2 and efficient oxidation of amines to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn2S4, as well as the optimized adsorption strength for key reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. We also demonstrate a synergistic interplay between CO2 reduction and amine dehydrogenation oxidation, rather than simply collecting these two single half&#8208;reactions in this dual&#8208;functional photoredox system.

         <title>Single Atom Ruthenium&#8208;Doped CoP/CDs Nanosheets via Splicing of Carbon&#8208;Dots for Robust Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite material was synthesized in which CoP nanoparticles, doped with single&#8208;atom Ru sites, are supported on single&#8208;particle thick nanosheets formed by splicing of CDs (Ru1CoP/CDs). The catalyst prepared under optimized conditions displayed an outstanding stability and activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline and acidic conditions.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional catalysts are attracting attention in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work describe a composite material design in which CoP nanoparticles doped with Ru single&#8208;atom sites supported on carbon dots (CDs) single&#8208;layer nanosheets formed by splicing CDs (Ru1CoP/CDs). Small CD fragments bore abundant functional groups, analogous to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and could provide a high density of binding sites to immobilize Ru1CoP. The single&#8208;particle&#8208;thick nanosheets formed by splicing CDs acted as supports, which improved the conductivity of the electrocatalyst and the stability of the catalyst during operation. The Ru1CoP/CDs formed from doping atomic Ru dispersed on CoP showed very high efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide pH range. The catalyst prepared under optimized conditions displayed outstanding stability and activity: the overpotential for the HER at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was as low as 51 and 49&#8197;mV under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Density functional theory calculations showed that the substituted Ru single atoms lowered the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer energy barrier and promoted H&#8722;H bond formation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance for the HER. The findings open a new avenue for developing carbon&#8208;based hybridization materials with integrated electrocatalytic performance for water splitting.

         <title>Advanced Real&#8208;Time Process Analytics for Multistep Synthesis in Continuous Flow**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Process analytical technologies hold tremendous promise in multistep continuous flow synthesis. Here, four orthogonal real&#8208;time analytical tools are employed in a three step synthesis, with phase separations. Advanced data processing techniques, such as indirect hard modeling and deep learning, facilitate quantification of up to 9 process components. These analytical capabilities are demonstrated for both steady state and dynamic experiments.







Abstract
In multistep continuous flow chemistry, studying complex reaction mixtures in real time is a significant challenge, but provides an opportunity to enhance reaction understanding and control. We report the integration of four complementary process analytical technology tools (NMR, UV/Vis, IR and UHPLC) in the multistep synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, mesalazine. This synthetic route exploits flow processing for nitration, high temperature hydrolysis and hydrogenation reactions, as well as three inline separations. Advanced data analysis models were developed (indirect hard modeling, deep learning and partial least squares regression), to quantify the desired products, intermediates and impurities in real time, at multiple points along the synthetic pathway. The capabilities of the system have been demonstrated by operating both steady state and dynamic experiments and represents a significant step forward in data&#8208;driven continuous flow synthesis.

         <title>Electrochemical Arylation of Aldehydes, Ketones, and Alcohols: from Cathodic Reduction to Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical approaches to the direct arylation of carbonyls and alcohols through less&#8208;explored cathodic reduction and convergent paired electrolysis are presented. This protocol features: excellent functional group (including ester, amide, amine, thioether, borate) tolerance, mild conditions (metal catalyst&#8208; and external reductant&#8208;free), good scalability (&gt;10&#8197;gram&#8208;scale), and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Arylation of carbonyls, one of the most common approaches toward alcohols, has received tremendous attention, as alcohols are important feedstocks and building blocks in organic synthesis. Despite great progress, there is still a great gap to develop an ideal arylation method featuring mild conditions, good functional group tolerance, and readily available starting materials. We now show that electrochemical arylation can fill the gap. By taking advantage of synthetic electrochemistry, commercially available aldehydes (ketones) and benzylic alcohols can be readily arylated to provide a general and scalable access to structurally diverse alcohols (97 examples, &gt;10&#8197;gram&#8208;scale). More importantly, convergent paired electrolysis, the ideal but challenging electrochemical technology, was employed to transform low&#8208;value alcohols into more useful alcohols. Detailed mechanism study suggests that two plausible pathways are involved in the redox neutral &#945;&#8208;arylation of benzylic alcohols.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing Alkylation of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols in the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scope of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming hydrogen&#8208;borrowing reactions has been expanded to include 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from both natural and unnatural amino acids. The vulnerable amine stereocentre is preserved in the reaction by the use of a bulky nitrogen protecting group (trityl or benzyl), with the products being readily cleaved under acidic conditions to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acids without further purification.







Abstract
For the first time we have been able to employ enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from abundant amino acids in C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming hydrogen&#8208;borrowing alkylation reactions. These reactions are facilitated by the use of the aryl ketone Ph*COMe. Racemisation of the amine stereocentre during alkylation can be prevented by the use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric base and protection of the nitrogen with a sterically hindered triphenylmethane (trityl) or benzyl group. The Ph* and trityl groups are readily cleaved in one pot to give &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) products as their HCl salts without further purification. Both steps may be performed in sequence without isolation of the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing intermediate, removing the need for column chromatography.

&lt;p&gt;For the first time we have been able to employ enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from abundant amino acids in C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming hydrogen&#8208;borrowing alkylation reactions. These reactions are facilitated by the use of the aryl ketone Ph*COMe. Racemisation of the amine stereocentre during alkylation can be prevented by the use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric base and protection of the nitrogen with a sterically hindered triphenylmethane (trityl) or benzyl group. The Ph* and trityl groups are readily cleaved in one pot to give &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) products as their HCl salts without further purification. Both steps may be performed in sequence without isolation of the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing intermediate, removing the need for column chromatography.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>cis&#8208;Quinacridone&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters: Seemingly Old but Renewed Functional Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear cis&#8208;quinacridone (cis&#8208;QA), a structural isomer of the renowned linear trans&#8208;quinacridone with a variation in the substitution positions of two amino and carbonyl groups, has been in a state of low visibility and unmarked as functional materials for a century. This contribution unveils the fascinating functionality and usefulness of cis&#8208;QA derivatives as narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a material design of linear cis&#8208;quinacridone (cis&#8208;QA) derivatives as delayed fluorescence luminogens. In contrast to the widely studied traditional trans&#8208;isomers, the functionality of cis&#8208;QA and its derivatives remains unexplored and unclarified. Through combined computational and experimental investigations, we revealed that cis&#8208;QA derivatives can function as fascinating narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best&#8208;performing deep&#8208;blue OLEDs incorporating these cis&#8208;QA luminogens achieved high external electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 19.0&#8201;% and high color purity with chromaticity coordinates of (0.13, 0.14).

         <title>Helicity&#8208; and Molecular&#8208;Weight&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Sorting and Assembly of Helical Polymers towards Two&#8208;Dimensional Smectic Architectures and Selectively Adhesive Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;handed helical polymers can recognize themselves by discrimination of their helicity and molecular weight, and further self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional smectic architectures. Moreover, gels formed from the helical polymers can also recognize themselves based on helicity and molecular weight and can selectively adhere together to form a one gel.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting plays a crucial role in living systems such as the selective assembly of DNA and specific folding of proteins. However, the self&#8208;sorting of artificial helical polymers such as biomacromolecules has rarely been achieved. In this work, single&#8208;handed helical poly(phenyl isocyanide)s bearing pyrene (Py) and naphthalene (Np) probes were prepared, which exhibited interesting self&#8208;sorting properties driven by both helicity and molecular weight (Mn) in solution, solid state, gel, and on the gel surface as well. The polymers with the same helix sense and similar Mn can self&#8208;sort and assemble into well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional smectic architectures and form stable gels in organic solvents. In contrast, mixed polymers with opposite handedness or different Mn were repulsive to each other and did not aggregate. Moreover, the gels of helical polymers with the same handedness and similar Mn can recognize themselves and adhere together to form a gel.

A method is reported for the selective silacyclization of (hetero)arenes via twofold C&#8722;H activation. An operationally convenient and stable silicon reagent, octamethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxacyclohexasilane (ODCS), is employed.







Abstract
The use of an operationally convenient and stable silicon reagent (octamethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxacyclohexasilane, ODCS) for the selective silacyclization of (hetero)arenes via twofold C&#8722;H activation is reported. This method is compatible with N&#8208;containing heteroarenes such as indoles and carbazoles of varying complexity. The ODCS reagent can also be utilized for silacyclization of other types of substrates, including tertiary phosphines and aryl halides. A series of mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the preferred pathway for this twofold C&#8722;H activation process.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Volume Phase Transition of Polyacid Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving past classical passive responsive behavior, transient volume phase transitions of poly(methacrylic acid) microgels can be achieved through the use of a chemical fuel. The deswelling creates a transient hydrophobic environment with a lifetime tunable via pH and fuel concentration with possible applications for encapsulation/release.







Abstract
Microgels are soft colloids that show responsive behavior and are easy to functionalize for applications. They are considered key components for future smart colloidal material systems. However, so far microgel systems have almost exclusively been studied in classical responsive switching settings using external triggers, while internally organized, autonomous control mechanisms as found in supramolecular chemistry and DNA nanotechnology relying on fuel&#8208;driven out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium concepts have not been implemented into microgel systems. Here, we introduce chemically fueled transient volume phase transitions (VPTs) for poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) microgels, where the collapsed hydrophobic state can be programmed using the fuel concentration in a cyclic reaction network. We discuss details of the system behavior as a function of pH and fuel amount, unravel kinetically trapped regions and showcase transient encapsulation and time&#8208;programmed release as a first application.

         <title>Boosting Zinc Electrode Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes by Using Low&#8208;Cost Antisolvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water activity and Zn2+ solvation in an ZnSO4 electrolyte are regulated by adding methanol as antisolvent. Methanol gradually interacts with the free and coordinated water in the Zn2+ solvation sheath in the electrolyte, to suppress side reactions and enhance the Zn2+ transference number. Concomitantly, Zn2+ deposition orientation is changed, resulting in dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and boosted Zn reversibility.







Abstract
Antisolvent addition has been widely studied in crystallization in the pharmaceutical industries by breaking the solvation balance of the original solution. Here we report a similar antisolvent strategy to boost Zn reversibility via regulation of the electrolyte on a molecular level. By adding for example methanol into ZnSO4 electrolyte, the free water and coordinated water in Zn2+ solvation sheath gradually interact with the antisolvent, which minimizes water activity and weakens Zn2+ solvation. Concomitantly, dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition occurs via change in the deposition orientation, as evidenced by in situ optical microscopy. Zn reversibility is significantly boosted in antisolvent electrolyte of 50&#8201;% methanol by volume (Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50&#8201;%) even under harsh environments of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the suppressed side reactions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50&#8201;% electrolyte significantly enhance performance of Zn/polyaniline coin and pouch cells. We demonstrate this low&#8208;cost strategy can be readily generalized to other solvents, indicating its practical universality. Results will be of immediate interest and benefit to a range of researchers in electrochemistry and energy storage.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Double Dearomative Cycloaddition of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes is reported. The reactions are carried out under mild conditions and feature a wide substrate scope. A large array of polycyclic indoline derivatives is afforded via dearomative [4+2] or [2+2] cycloaddition pathways in high yields with exclusive diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Herein we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes. Compared with the well&#8208;known photodimerization of arenes under ultraviolet irradiation, the current reactions are carried out under mild conditions and feature wide substrate scope. A large array of structurally&#8208;diverse polycyclic indoline derivatives is afforded in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with exclusive diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) via dearomative [4+2] or [2+2] pathway.

         <title>Non&#8208;Metal Ion Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Zn/MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible H+/NH4+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism was developed in an aqueous Zn/MnO2 battery system. The co&#8208;insertion of H+/NH4+ ions in MnO2 endows the aqueous batteries with the fast kinetics of ion diffusion and the reversible structure evolution of MnO2 due to the synergistic effect between the dual cations. As a result, such Zn/MnO2 batteries display enhanced electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The co&#8208;insertion of dual ions can often offer enhanced electrochemical performance for the aqueous zinc batteries. Although the insertion of non&#8208;metallic ions has been achieved in aqueous zinc batteries, the co&#8208;insertion chemistry of non&#8208;metallic cations is still a challenge. Here, a reversible H+/NH4+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism was developed in an aqueous Zn/MnO2 battery system. The synergistic effect between the dual cations endows the aqueous batteries with the fast kinetics of ion diffusion and the reversible structure evolution of MnO2. As a result, the Zn/MnO2 battery displays excellent rate capability and cycling performance. This work will pave the way toward the design of aqueous rechargeable batteries with non&#8208;metallic ions.

         <title>Melanin&#8208;Inspired Chromophoric Microparticles Composed of Polymeric Peptide Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by melanin diversity and biosynthesis, a method to produce melanin&#8208;like microparticles as a reactive scaffold for subsequent oxidative incorporation of amino acids was developed. The spontaneous formation of distinct new chromophores with optical properties that are far beyond the range of those found in biological melanins, in terms of color, UV absorbance and fluorescent emission is demonstrated.







Abstract
Melanin and related polyphenolic pigments are versatile functional polymers that serve diverse aesthetic and protective roles across the living world. These polymeric pigments continue to inspire the development of adhesive, photonic, electronic and radiation&#8208;protective materials and coatings. The properties of these structures are dictated by covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in ways that, despite progress, are not fully understood. It remains a major challenge to direct oxidative polymerization of their precursors (amino acids, (poly&#8208;)phenols, thiols) toward specific structures. By taking advantage of supramolecular pre&#8208;organization of tyrosine&#8208;tripeptides and reactive sequestering of selected amino acids during enzymatic oxidation, we demonstrate the spontaneous formation of distinct new chromophores with optical properties that are far beyond the range of those found in biological melanins, in terms of color, UV absorbance and fluorescent emission.

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Couplings of Aryl Diazonium Salts in Methanol: PdII&#8211;Alkoxy as Reactivity&#8208;Controlling Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed systematic experimental and computational studies on the roles of transmetalating agent, solvent, base and the likely involvement of in situ formed diazoether derivatives challenge the currently accepted mechanism of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryldiazonium salts.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl diazonium salts are generally assumed to proceed via cationic PdII intermediates which in turn would be highly reactive in the subsequent transmetalation step. Contrary to this belief, we herein report our observation and rationalization of opposing reactivities of ArN2+ in Suzuki (=effective) and Stille (=ineffective) cross&#8208;couplings in MeOH. Our systematic experimental and computational studies on the roles of transmetalating agent, solvent, base and the likely involvement of in situ formed diazoether derivatives challenge the currently accepted mechanism. Our data suggest that the observed solvent dichotomy is primarily due to PdII&#8208;methoxy intermediates being formed, which are unreactive with arylstannanes, but highly reactive with arylboronic acids, complementing the Suzuki &#8220;Pd&#8208;oxy&#8221; mechanism with the direct demonstration of transmetalation of a PdII&#8208;alkoxy complex. Lewis acids were found to circumvent this reactivity divergence, promoting efficient couplings regardless of the employed conditions or coupling partners.

         <title>Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts toward Practical Fuel Cells: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fuel cells are a powerful renewable energy technology. This review gives a comprehensive overview on oxygen reduction electrocatalysts towards practical fuel cells.







Abstract
Fuel cells are an incredibly powerful renewable energy technology, but their broad applications remains lagging because of the high cost and poor reliability of cathodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This review focuses on the recent progress of ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells. More importantly, it highlights the fundamental problems associated with the insufficient activity translation from rotating disk electrode to membrane electrode assembly in the fuel cells. Finally, for the atomic&#8208;level in&#8208;depth information on ORR catalysts in fuel cells, potential perspectives are suggested, including large&#8208;scale preparation, unified assessment criteria, advanced interpretation techniques, advanced simulation and artificial intelligence. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the fundamental science and technical engineering for efficient ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Heteroarenyne Cycloisomerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ene&#8208;type cycloisomerization of heteroarenynes been developed with alkyne&#8208;tethered indoles as substrates. The reaction provides an efficient avenue for the synthesis of structurally diverse indolines bearing quaternary stereocenters in moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The extensively developed ene&#8208;type enantioselective cycloisomerization of classical 1,n&#8208;enynes provides an efficient approach to chiral cyclic 1,4&#8208;dienes. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric heteroarenyne (heteroarene&#8211;alkyne) cycloisomerization involving the dearomative transformation of endocyclic aromatic C=C bonds remains unknown. Herein, we communicate a PdH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective heteroarenyne cycloisomerization reaction of alkyne&#8208;tethered indole substrates (formal 1,5&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;enynes). Based on this strategy, a variety of structurally diverse chiral spiro and fused indoline derivatives bearing quaternary stereocenters and exocyclic C=C bonds are afforded in moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The classical ene&#8208;type enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization of N&#8208;vinylpropiolamides is also developed to afford chiral 2&#8208;pyrrolones in good to excellent ee values.

&lt;p&gt;The extensively developed ene&#8208;type enantioselective cycloisomerization of classical 1,n&#8208;enynes provides an efficient approach to chiral cyclic 1,4&#8208;dienes. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric heteroarenyne (heteroarene&#8211;alkyne) cycloisomerization involving the dearomative transformation of endocyclic aromatic C=C bonds remains unknown. Herein, we communicate a PdH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective heteroarenyne cycloisomerization reaction of alkyne&#8208;tethered indole substrates (formal 1,5&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;enynes). Based on this strategy, a variety of structurally diverse chiral spiro and fused indoline derivatives bearing quaternary stereocenters and exocyclic C=C bonds are afforded in moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The classical ene&#8208;type enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;vinylpropiolamides is also developed to afford chiral 2&#8208;pyrrolones in good to excellent ee values.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Reactive Centers for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting. The catalytic mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationships are well elaborated based on the recent progress from the operando investigations.







Abstract
Developing electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies for replacing the traditional energy source is highly expected to resolve the fossil fuel exhaustion and related environmental problems. Exploring stable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near&#8208;range coordination environment, long&#8208;range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs. In the current Review, some recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting are well summarized. The catalytic mechanism and the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship are elaborated based on the recent progresses of various operando investigations. Finally, by highlighting the challenges and prospects for the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis, we hope to shed some light on the future research of SACs for the electrocatalytic energy conversion.

         <title>Pristine Hollow Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Design, Synthesis and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow MOFs show outstanding properties in catalysis, separation, storage, sensing and energy applications resulting from their tunable composition/structure versatility and designability, exceeding the molecular scale. In this review, synthetic strategies for engineering hollow MOFs and their applications are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring porous crystalline structures with coordinated metal nodes and organic linkers, have recently found increasing interest in diverse applications. By virtue of their versatile and highly tunable compositions and structures, constructing hollow architectures will further endow MOFs with enhanced properties and designability, exceeding the molecular scale. MOFs could be considered as promising building units to fabricate complex hollow nanocomposites with faster mass transport, multiple active components, more exposed active sites, and better compatibility than bulk MOFs. To construct a promising blueprint for hollow pristine MOFs, this review provides a comprehensive overview for structural design strategies and applications of hollow pristine MOFs. We will highlight the merits, challenges and future potential by structuring and applying MOFs in sensing, separation, storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, photochemical and electrochemical energy conversion. This review might pave a new avenue for future development of novel pristine hollow MOFs.

         <title>Photochemically Activated Dimagnesium(I) Compounds: Reagents for the Reduction and Selective C&#8722;H Bond Activation of Inert Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical activation of dimagnesium(I) compounds, and subsequent high yielding double reductions, and regioselective C&#8722;H bond activations, of a range of normally inert arene substrates are reported (see picture, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free selective C&#8722;H bond activations hold considerable potential for organic synthesis.







Abstract
The photochemical activation of dimagnesium(I) compounds, and subsequent high yielding, regioselective reactions with inert arenes are reported. Irradiating benzene solutions of [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8722;; Ar=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dip) or 2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylphenyl (TCHP)) with blue or UV light, leads to double reduction of benzene and formation of the &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; cyclohexadienediyl bridged compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6)]. Irradiation of [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] in toluene, and each of the three isomers of xylene, promoted completely regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activations, and formation of [(DipNacnac)Mg(Ar&#8242;)] (Ar&#8242;=meta&#8208;tolyl; 2,3&#8208;, 3,5&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl), and [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2]. Fluorobenzene was cleanly defluorinated by photoactivated [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2], leading to biphenyl and [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}2]. Computational studies suggest all reactions proceed via photochemically generated magnesium(I) radicals, which reduce the arene substrate, before C&#8722;H or C&#8722;F bond activation processes occur.

         <title>CeIV70 Oxosulfate Rings, Frameworks, Supramolecular Assembly, and Redox Activity**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce70&#8208;sulfate wheel assembles from water into intricate frameworks with transition metal countercations. Dissolved in organic media, Ce70 exhibits very different supramolecular assembly. These frameworks demonstrate redox activity, owed to mixed CeIII/IV linking monomers.







Abstract
MIV molecular oxo&#8208;clusters (M=Zr, Hf, Ce, Th, U, Np, Pu) are prolific in bottoms&#8208;up material design, catalysis, and elucidating reaction pathways in nature and in synthesis. Here we introduce Ce70, a wheel&#8208;shaped oxo&#8208;cluster, [CeIV70(OH)36(O)64(SO4)60(H2O)10]4&#8722;. Ce70 crystallizes into intricate high pore volume frameworks with divalent transition metals and Ce&#8208;monomer linkers. Eight crystal&#8208;structures feature four framework types in which the Ce70&#8208;rings are linked as propellers, in offset&#8208;stacks, in a tartan pattern, and as isolated rings. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering of Ce70 dissolved in butylamine, with and without added cations (CeIV, alkaline earths, MnII), shows the metals&#8216; differentiating roles in ring linking, leading to supramolecular assemblies. The large acidic pores and abundant terminal sulfates provide ion&#8208;exchange behavior, demonstrated with UIV and NdIII. Frameworks featuring CeIII/IV&#8208;monomer linkers demonstrate both oxidation and reduction. This study opens the door to mixed&#8208;metal, highly porous framework catalysts, and new clusters for metal&#8208;organic framework design

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Desaturation of Cyclic Ketones through Direct Metal&#8211;Enolate Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diene&#8208;platinum complex, (COD)Pt(TFA)2, serves as an efficient and chemoselective catalyst for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;desaturation of cyclic ketones through direct Pt&#8208;enolate formation. Distinct from known ketone dehydrogenation methods, a wide range of sensitive functional groups are tolerated. Mechanistic studies suggest a fast reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;H elimination.







Abstract
The development of a platinum&#8208;catalyzed desaturation of cyclic ketones to their conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated counterparts is reported in this full article. A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation. The reaction operates under mild conditions without using strong bases or acids. Good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds.

     alt="Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Desaturation of Cyclic Ketones through Direct Metal&#8211;Enolate Formation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diene&#8208;platinum complex, (COD)Pt(TFA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, serves as an efficient and chemoselective catalyst for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;desaturation of cyclic ketones through direct Pt&#8208;enolate formation. Distinct from known ketone dehydrogenation methods, a wide range of sensitive functional groups are tolerated. Mechanistic studies suggest a fast reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;H elimination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a platinum&#8208;catalyzed desaturation of cyclic ketones to their conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated counterparts is reported in this full article. A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation. The reaction operates under mild conditions without using strong bases or acids. Good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds. A wide range of functional groups, including those sensitive to acids, bases/nucleophiles, or palladium species, are tolerated, which represents a distinct feature from other known desaturation methods. Mechanistically, this platinum catalysis exhibits a fast and reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by a rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination process, which is different from the prior Pd&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method. Promising preliminary enantioselective desaturation using a chiral&#8208;diene&#8208;platinum complex has also been obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Physical Entangling Strategy for Simultaneous Interior and Exterior Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the conventional approach where polymer brushes were covalently grafted on the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ligand, our approach involves grafting polyimide brushes to the polymer chains physically entangled with the framework through in&#8197;situ polymerization. This allows the decoration of non&#8208;functionalized MOF surfaces with polyimides for improved dispersibility in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.







Abstract
A new strategy uses a common feature of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely porosity rather than functionality, to achieve simultaneous interior and exterior modification of a MOF with polymers. We demonstrate that an anhydride&#8208;terminated polyimide oligomer can be covalently grafted to the amine&#8208;functionalized methacrylate polymer backbone residing underneath the MOF surface and physically entangled within the 3D nanochannels. The MOF particles were evenly coated with a thin layer of polyimide brushes on the surface thereby exhibiting increased dispersibility in solvent media as well as in polymer matrix. The MOF pores were decorated with aliphatic amine groups to endow the MOF with higher CO2 affinity at low pressure. The polyimide&#8208;grafted surface allowed MOF particles to interact favorably with the polyimide matrix, producing defect&#8208;free MMM with drastically improved CO2 permeability and maintaining the inherent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of the neat polymeric membrane.

         <title>A General Approach for Monolayer Adsorption of High Weight Loadings of Uniform Nanocrystals on Oxide Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for monolayer adsorption of hydrophobic surfactant&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on oxides through surface functionalization with amino groups is presented.







Abstract
Monodispersed metal and semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research due to their tunable size, morphology, and well&#8208;defined chemical composition. Utilizing these nanocrystals in a controllable way is highly desirable especially when using them as building blocks for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Their deposition onto oxide materials provide them with wide applicability in many areas, including catalysis. However, so far deposition methods are limited and do not provide control to achieve high particle loadings. This study demonstrates a general approach for the deposition of hydrophobic ligand&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on hydrophilic oxide supports without ligand&#8208;exchange. Surface functionalization of the supports with primary amine groups either using an organosilane ((3&#8208;aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane) or bonding with aminoalcohols (3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol) were found to significantly improve the interaction between nanocrystals and supports achieving high loadings (&gt;10&#8197;wt.&#8201;%). The bonding method with aminoalcohols guarantees the opportunity to remove the binding molecules thus allowing clean metal/oxide materials to be obtained, which is of great importance in the preparation of supported nanocrystals for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Nanostar Sieving (PEPSTAR)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEPSTAR, a &#8220;rising star&#8221; in peptide synthesis, features a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support to grow peptides with organic solvent nanofiltration for isolation. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar enables efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal and nanofiltration, which all performed continuously in a synthesizer to produce high purity peptide crudes through a one&#8208;pot approach.







Abstract
Herein, a one&#8208;pot liquid phase peptide synthesis featuring iterative addition of amino acids to a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support, with organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) for isolation of the growing peptide after each synthesis cycle is reported. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal, then sieving out of the reaction by&#8208;products via nanofiltration in a reactor&#8208;separator, or synthesizer apparatus where no phase or material transfers are required between cycles. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar facilitates both efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring of each process cycle. This enabled the synthesis of peptides more efficiently while retaining the full benefits of liquid phase synthesis. PEPSTAR was validated initially with the synthesis of enkephalin&#8208;like model penta&#8208; and decapeptides, then octreotate amide and finally octreotate. The crude purities compared favorably to vendor produced samples from solid phase synthesis.

         <title>A Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Stabilized Triplet Carbon Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene/anthracene&#8208;fused porphyrins were synthesized by a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and subsequent intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and oxidation. The structures of 3Ni, 6Ni, 9Ni, 11Ni, and 13Ni have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 11Ni is characterized as a surprisingly stable radical (t1/2=28&#8197;days under ambient air and at 80&#8201;&#176;C) that is storable for more than several months, despite its high&#8208;spin triplet ground&#8208;state carbon diradical.







Abstract
The synthesis of robust high&#8208;spin carbon radicals is an important topic in organic chemistry. Toward this end, several porphyrin&#8208;stabilized radicals have been systematically explored. A singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical was synthesized by a reaction sequence consisting of a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of &#946;&#8208;borylated porphyrin with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde, addition of mesityl Grignard reagent, intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and final oxidation with DDQ or tBuOK/O2. This strategy was also used to synthesize doubly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrins and syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;fused&#8208;anthracene&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers. While singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical has been shown to be a stable monoradical, doubly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrins and anti&#8208;fused&#8208;anthracene&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been shown to be closed&#8208;shell molecules. Finally, the syn&#8208;dimer was characterized as a surprisingly stable radical (t1/2=28&#8197;days under ambient air and at 80&#8201;&#176;C) that is storable for more than several months, despite its high&#8208;spin triplet ground&#8208;state carbon diradical.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of&#160;Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme  E. coli  &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphor Embedded in Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle with High Light&#8208;Harvesting Efficiency for Dual Photosystem Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared nanophosphor, ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ (ZGOCS@MSN), with high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency triggers the Emerson effect of the photosynthetic centers (PSI and PSII) to enhance photosynthesis. A suitable ZGOCS@MSN concentration increased the fresh weight and chlorophyll content of Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis and enhanced the electron transfer rate and its distribution in various plant parts.







Abstract
Light&#8208;harvesting and conversion ability is important to promote plant growth, and especially when resources are limited. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nanophosphor embedded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ (ZGOCS), was developed and its optical properties were harnessed to enhance the photosynthetic ability of Brassica rapa spp. chinensis. The broad excitation of ZGOCS from the ultraviolet to the visible region allowed the conversion of extra light into near&#8208;infrared light (650&#8211;800&#8197;nm) and thus promoted the dual photosystem via the Emerson effect. ZGOCS@MSN was spherical with a size of 65&#177;10&#8197;nm and good dispersion. A light conversion ability of up to 75&#8201;% under different wavelengths was achieved. Moreover, the electron transfer rate of photosynthesis increased by 100&#8201;% with a suitable ZGOCS@MSN concentration. Plant and animal models were used to explore the effects of the nanophosphor. ZGOCS@MSN distribution was tracked by monitoring its NIR emission in plant and animal tissues, demonstrating that this nanophosphor can be potentially utilized in plant growth.

         <title>Hexagonal RuSe2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal RuSe2 nanosheets (h&#8208;RuSe2), including 2H and 1T phases, are prepared in a one&#8208;pot colloidal synthesis. This new member of the family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) displays significantly enhanced HER performance. The structural phase change from h&#8208;RuSe2 to cubic RuSe2 takes place upon annealing at 600&#8201;&#176;C. This is a significant step forward in expanding the family of layered TMDs.







Abstract
Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials are promising alternatives to platinum (Pt) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the family of layered TMDs is mainly limited to Group IV&#8211;VII transition metals, while the synthesis of layered TMDs based on metals from other groups still remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate by atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy that hexagonal RuSe2 (h&#8208;RuSe2) nanosheets with a mixture of 2H and 1T phases can be obtained by a facile bottom&#8208;up colloidal synthetic approach. The obtained h&#8208;RuSe2, which can be transformed into the thermodynamically favorable phase of cubic RuSe2 (c&#8208;RuSe2) only after annealing at 600&#8201;&#176;C, exhibits Pt&#8208;like HER performance, with a fivefold turnover frequency enhancement compared to the c&#8208;RuSe2 in alkaline media. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced adsorption free energies of H2O (&#916;G
), optimized adsorption free energies of H (&#916;GH*), and increased conductivity of h&#8208;RuSe2 contribute to its superior HER activity.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Remote Nitrogen Atoms of (Benz)imidazole&#8208;Derived Aldimines for Enantioselective Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of carbene&#8208;catalyzed activation and reaction of nitrogen atom is disclosed. The reaction starts with the addition of the carbene catalyst to imine to form an aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to eventually form NHC&#8208;bound triaza&#8208;diene as the key intermediate. This triaza&#8208;diene intermediate then undergoes highly enantioselective reactions with activated ketones through a concerted asynchronous pathway.







Abstract
A new mode of carbene&#8208;catalyzed heteroatom activation and asymmetric reactions is disclosed. The reaction starts with addition of a carbene catalyst to a (benz)imidazole&#8208;derived aldimine substrate. Subsequent oxidation and proton transfer lead to the formation of a catalyst&#8208;bound triaza&#8208;diene as the key intermediate, in which the nitrogen atom at a site remote to the catalyst&#8208;substrate bond is activated. This unusual triaza&#8208;diene intermediate then undergoes highly enantioselective reactions with activated ketones through a concerted asynchronous pathway, as supported by mechanistic studies and preliminary density function theory calculation.

         <title>Tailoring the Pore Size and Chemistry of Ionic Ultramicroporous Polymers for Trace Sulfur Dioxide Capture with High Capacity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) hosting high&#8208;density of basic Br&#8722; anions in narrowly distributed ultramicroporosity achieve the deep removal of SO2 at ultra&#8208;low pressure with high uptake capacity and record SO2/CO2 selectivity (&gt;5000). The impressive thermal and water stability as well as the remarkable recycling performance make the IUPs as a potential material for practical desulfurization processes.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate the deep removal of SO2 with high uptake capacity (1.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and record SO2/CO2 selectivity (&gt;5000) at ultra&#8208;low pressure of 0.002&#8197;bar, using ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) with high density of basic anions. The successful construction of uniform ultramicropores via polymerizing ionic monomers into IUPs enables the fully exploitation of the selective anionic sites. Notably, the aperture size and surface chemistry of IUPs can be finely tuned by adjusting the branched structure of ionic monomers, which play critical roles in excluding CH4 and N2, as well as reducing the coadsorption of CO2. The swelling property of IUPs with adsorption of SO2 contributed to the high SO2 uptake capacity and high separation selectivity. Systematic investigations including static gas adsorption, dynamic breakthrough experiments, stability tests and modeling studies confirmed the efficient performance of IUPs for trace SO2 capture.

         <title>Selective Triazenation Reaction (STaR) of Secondary Amines for Tagging Monomethyl Lysine Post&#8208;Translational Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel chemoselective selective triazenation reaction, termed &#8220;STaR&#8221;, of secondary amines for the selective enrichment of monomethyl lysine (Kme) post&#8208;translational modifications from a complex protein mixture using diazonium ions under physiological conditions followed by the &#8220;traceless&#8221; release of the Kme peptides under mild acidic conditions.







Abstract
Lysine monomethylation (Kme) is an impactful post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) responsible for regulating biological processes and implicated in diseases, thus there is great interest in identifying these methylation marks globally. However, the progress in this area has been challenging because the addition of a small methyl group on lysine leads to negligible change in the bulk, charge, and hydrophobicity. Herein, we report an empowering chemical technology selective triazenation reaction, which we term &#8220;STaR&#8221;, of secondary amines using arene diazonium salts to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust tagging of Kme peptides from a complex mixture under biocompatible conditions. Although the resulting triazene&#8208;linkage with Kme is stable, we highlight the efficient decoupling of the triazene&#8208;conjugate to afford unmodified starting components under mild conditions when desired. Our work establishes a unique chemoselective, traceless bioconjugation strategy for the selective enrichment of Kme PTMs.

Phosphazenes organocatalysts have been found to promote a highly&#8208;active, controlled, and selective alternating ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and cyclic anhydrides. This one&#8208;pot methodology leads not only to homopolymers but also to poly(ester amide)&#8208;based block copolymers.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic methodology for poly(ester amide)s by anionic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and cyclic anhydrides. Phosphazenes organocatalysts have been found to promote a highly&#8208;active, controlled, and selective alternating copolymerization in the absence of any competitive side reaction (zwitterionic mechanism and exchange transacylations). Mechanistic studies have shown first&#8208;order dependence of the copolymerization rate in N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and phosphazenes, and zero&#8208;order in cyclic anhydrides. This one&#8208;pot methodology leads not only to homopolymers but also to poly(ester amide)&#8208;based block copolymers. Two catalytic cycles involving ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines with cyclic anhydrides and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines have been proposed to explain the one pot synthesis of poly(ester amide)&#8208;based homo&#8208; and block copolymers.

         <title>Heterometallic Actinide&#8208;Containing Photoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Dynamic and Static Tuning of Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merging of heterometallic actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks and photochromic moieties allowed for dynamic tailoring of electronics properties as a function of excitation wavelength. Visualization of material photoswitchable behavior was demonstrated by construction of the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor.







Abstract
Acquiring fundamental knowledge of properties of actinide&#8208;based materials is a necessary step to create new possibilities for addressing the current challenges in the nuclear energy and nuclear waste sectors. In this report, we established a photophysics&#8211;electronics correlation for actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (An&#8208;MOFs) as a function of excitation wavelength, for the first time. A stepwise approach for dynamically modulating electronic properties was applied for the first time towards actinide&#8208;based heterometallic MOFs through integration of photochromic linkers. Optical cycling, modeling of density of states near the Fermi edge, conductivity measurements, and photoisomerization kinetics were employed to shed light on the process of tailoring optoelectronic properties of An&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, in which the field&#8208;effect response could be changed through light exposure, was constructed. As a demonstration, the change in current upon light exposure was sufficient to operate a two&#8208;LED fail&#8208;safe indicator circuit.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Dissolution and Polymerization of Mo in Ni4Mo Alloy for Promoting the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiMo alloys, as one of the most efficient electrocatalysts in the alkaline electrolyzer, are unstable during the alkaline hydrogen evolution. An in situ transformation including oxidative dissolution of Mo in the form of MoO42&#8722;, the re&#8208;adsorption of MoO42&#8722;, the polymerization of MoO42&#8722; to Mo2O72&#8722;, and the activity promotion by the Mo2O72&#8722; is presented.







Abstract
NiMo alloys are efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolyzer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Metals are usually considered to be stable during the cathodic process. However, the actual behaviors of Mo in the NiMo alloys are unexplored. Here, we present the instability of Mo in the Ni4Mo alloy as a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. Mo in Ni4Mo is oxidized and dissolved in the form of MoO42&#8722; first. The dissolved MoO42&#8722; will re&#8208;adsorb on the electrode surface and polymerize. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption of the dimer Mo2O72&#8722; can promote the HER activity of metal Ni. The addition of MoO42&#8722; to the electrolyte can not only repair the durability of Ni4Mo alloy, but also facilitate the HER activity of pure metal of Ni, Fe, and Co. Our findings provide insight into the structural transformation mechanism and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of cathodic materials under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Photoresponsive Molecular Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic self&#8208;assembly of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles at Gibbs monolayers, i.e., air&#8211;water interfaces, and in solutions, ranging from isotropic assembly transformations to anisotropic three&#8208;dimensional structures, provides the amplification of molecular motion to macroscopic functions.







Abstract
Amphiphilic molecules, comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and the intrinsic propensity to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous environment, sustain a fascinating spectrum of structures and functions ranging from biological membranes to ordinary soap. Facing the challenge to design responsive, adaptive, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in water, the incorporation of photoresponsive motifs in amphiphilic molecular structures offers ample opportunity to design supramolecular systems that enables functional responses in water in a non&#8208;invasive way using light. Here, we discuss the design of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles, their self&#8208;assembled structures in aqueous media and at air&#8211;water interfaces, and various approaches to arrive at adaptive and dynamic functions in isotropic and anisotropic systems, including motion at the air&#8211;water interface, foam formation, reversible nanoscale assembly, and artificial muscle function. Controlling the delicate interplay of structural design, self&#8208;assembling conditions and external stimuli, these responsive amphiphiles open several avenues towards application such as soft adaptive materials, controlled delivery or soft actuators, bridging a gap between artificial and natural dynamic systems.

         <title>Broadening the Horizon of the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi Principle towards Optically Triggered Structure Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi principle was used to probe photoinduced structure planarization of a series of dibenz[b,f]azepine (DBA) derivatives incorporating bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar and rotation motion. A saddle point was calculated for all PDBAs along the structural transition pathway. A relationship was elucidated between kinetics and thermodynamics, providing insight into the ratiometric luminescence properties of excited&#8208;state structural transformations.







Abstract
Finding a relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics may be difficult. However, semi&#8208;empirical rules exist to compensate for this shortcoming, among which the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi (B&#8208;E&#8208;P) principle is an example for reactions involving bond breakage and reformation. We expand the B&#8208;E&#8208;P principle to a new territory by probing photoinduced structure planarization (PISP) of a series of dibenz[b,f]azepine derivatives incorporating bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar and rotation motion. The latter involves twisting of the partial double bond character, thereby inducing a barrier that is substituent dependent at the para N&#8208;phenyl position. The transition&#8208;state structure and frequency data satisfy and broaden the B&#8208;E&#8208;P principle to PISP reactions without bond rearrangement. Together with dual emissions during PISP, this makes possible harnessing of the kinetics/thermodynamics relationship and hence ratiometric luminescence properties for excited&#8208;state structural transformations.

         <title>Crystal Structures and Catalytic Mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Diaminohexanoate Dehydrogenase and Rational Engineering for Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) have shown considerable potential as biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids. However, compared to the widely studied &#945;&#8208;AADHs, limited knowledge is available about &#946;&#8208;AADHs that enable the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Herein we report the crystal structures of a  l  &#8208;  erythro  &#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of &#946;&#8208;AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from &#945;&#8208;AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity by 110&#8208;800 times toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt; 99%  ee  ) and high isolated yields (86%&#8208;87%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A single pot template reaction towards a manganese based T1 contrast agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA,  MnL  Me  , and studied the most important physicochemical properties  in vitro  .  MnL  Me  displays optimized,  r  1  relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64 MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400MHz) and an enhanced  r  1  b  = 21.1 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  (20 MHz, 298 K, pH 7.4) upon binding to BSA (K  a  = 4.2 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8208;1  ).  In vivo  studies show that  MnL  Me  is cleared intact into the bladder through hepatobiliary excretion and a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist.  MnL  Me  shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;Peroxo Species Formed in the Bulk of Silicate Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen redox in Li&#8208;rich oxides may boost the energy&#8208;density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by incorporating oxygen chemistry in solid cathodes. However, oxygen redox in the bulk usually entangles with voltage hysteresis and oxygen release, resulting in a prolonged controversy in literature on oxygen transformation. Here, we report spectroscopic evidence of peroxo species formed and confined in silicate cathodes amid oxygen redox at high&#8208;voltage, accompanied with Co  2+  /Co  3+  redox dominant at low&#8208;voltage. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that localized electrons on dangling oxygen drive the O&#8208;O dimerization. The covalence between the binding cation and the O&#8208;O dimer determines the degree of electron transfer in oxygen transformation. Dimerization induces irreversible structural distortion and slow kinetics. But peroxo formation can minimize the voltage drop and volume expansion in cumulative cationic and anionic redox. These findings offer insights into oxygen redox in the bulk for rational designs of high energy&#8208;density cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Size&#8208;Controlled m&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Urea Oligomers and Their Biomimetic Chloride Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The m&#8208;pyridine urea (mPU) oligomer was constructed by using the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed by the pyridine nitrogen atom and the NH of urea and the intermolecular hydrogen bond of the terminal carbonyl group and the NH of urea. Due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonds, mPU oligomer folds and exhibits strong self&#8208;assembly behavior. Affected by folding, mPU oligomer generates a twisted plane, and one of its important features is that the carbonyl group of the urea group orientates outwards from the twisted plane, while the NHs tend to direct inward.   This feature is beneficial to NH attraction for electron&#8208;rich species. Among them, trimer  1a  self&#8208;assembles into helical nanotubes, and can efficiently transport chloride ions. This study provides a novel and efficient strategy for constructing self&#8208;assembled biomimetic materials for electron&#8208;rich species transmission.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>DON (6&#8208;Diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine), a diazo&#8208;containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60 years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic&#160;pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala&#8211;DON&#8211;DON which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr&#8208;93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90a isoform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N&#8208;terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the  pan  &#8208;inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90a&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt; 50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.</dc:description>

         <title>ITQ&#8208;69: A new Ge&#8208;containing zeolite and its synthesis, structure determination and adsorption properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a new zeolite named as ITQ&#8208;69, has been synthesized, characterized and its application as selective adsorbent for industrially relevant light olefins/paraffins separations has been assessed. This material has been obtained as pure germania as well as silica&#8208;germania zeolites with different Si/Ge ratios using a diquaternary ammonium cation as organic structure directing agent. Its structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction showing a triclinic unit cell forming a tridirectional small pore channel system (8 &#215; 8 &#215; 8R). Also, it has been found that Si preferentially occupies some special T sites of the structure as deduced from Rietveld analysis of the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. In addition, the new zeolite ITQ&#8208;69 has been found to be stable upon calcination and thus, its adsorption properties were evaluated, showing a promising kinetic selectivity for light olefin separations in the C3 fraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar and Visible Light Assisted Peptide Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste&#8208;generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi&#8208;step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on Sun light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent  in situ  . The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide couplings. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets in order to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB&#8242;X6 (A = monocation, X = halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites. But the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Delayed linker addition (DLA) synthesis for hybrid SOD ZIFs with unsubstituted imidazolate linkers for propylene/propane and n&#8208;butane/i&#8208;butane separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel synthesis strategy termed delayed linker addition (DLA) to synthesize hybrid zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks containing unsubstituted imidazolate linkers (Im) with SOD topology (hereafter termed Im/ZIF&#8208;8). Im linker incorporation can create larger voids and apertures, which are important properties for gas storage and separation. To date, there have been only a handful of reports of Im linkers incorporated into ZIF&#8208;8 frameworks, typically requiring arduous and complicated post synthesis approaches. DLA, as reported here, is a simple one&#8208;step synthesis strategy allowing high incorporation of Im linker into the ZIF&#8208;8 framework while still retaining its SOD topology. We fabricated mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) with 6FDA&#8208;DAM polymer and Im/ZIF&#8208;8 obtained via DLA as a filler. The Im/ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;containing MMMs showed excellent performance for both propylene/propane and n&#8208;butane/i&#8208;butane separation, displaying permeability and ideal selectivity well above the polymer upper bound. Moreover, highly detailed molecular simulations shed light to the aperture size and flexibility response of Im/ZIF&#8208;8 and its improved diffusivity as compared to ZIF&#8208;8.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Hindrance in Metal Coordination Drives the Separation of Pyridine Regioisomers Using Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The physicochemical similarity of isomers makes their chemical separation through conventional techniques energy intensive. Herein, we report that, instead of using traditional encapsulation&#8208;driven processes, steric hindrance in metal coordination on the outer surface of Rh(II)&#8208;Based Metal Organic Polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) can be used to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers via liquid&#8208;liquid extraction. Through molecular dynamics simulations and wet experiments, we discovered that the capacity of pyridines to coordinatively bind to Rh&#8208;MOPs is determined by the positions of the pyridine substituents relative to the pyridine nitrogen and is influenced by steric hindrance. Thus, we exploited the differential solubility of bound and non&#8208;bound pyridine regioisomers to engineer liquid&#8208;liquid self&#8208;sorting systems. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we separated four different equimolecular mixtures of regioisomers, including a mixture of the industrially&#8208;relevant compounds 2&#8208;chloropyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine, isolating highly pure compounds in all cases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin A  was isolated from the aerial parts of  Isodon scoparius  . Chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis established its structure as an unsymmetrical meroditerpenoid bearing a sterically congested 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from commercially available (+)&#8208;sclareolide. A cobalt catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;based olefin isomerization was used to prepare a trisubstituted alkene, which underwent stereoselective [2 + 2] cycloaddition with a substituted keteniminium ion generated in situ from the corresponding amide. The cyclobutanone product was further elaborated into the fully substituted cyclobutane core through face&#8208;selective homologation, and the two side chains were installed by using nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and carbodiimide&#8208;mediated esterification, respectively.

         <title>Cage&#8208;like Porous Materials with Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Excellent C2H2/CO2 Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based separation is an important technology for C  2  H  2  purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  , the high uptake of C  2  H  2  also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage&#8208;like porous materials named FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R = Me, Et,  n  Pr and  i  Pr) which all have high C  2  H  2  uptakes at 1.01 bar and 298 K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation performance. Particularly, FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90 min g  &#8208;1  . Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate&#8208;Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free&#8208;radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenes with Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first cationic titanium catalyst system for the intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes with various tertiary alkylamines is presented. Corresponding reactions which involve the addition of the alpha&#8208;C&#8208;H bond of a tertiary amine across the C&#8208;C double bond of an alkene take place at temperatures close to room temperature with excellent regioselectivity to deliver the branched products exclusively. Interestingly, for selected amines, alpha&#8208;C&#8208;H bond activation occurs not only at  N  &#8208;methyl but also at  N  &#8208;methylene groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in GeSe Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orthorhombic GeSe is a promising thermoelectric material. However, large band gap and strong covalent bonding result in low thermoelectric figure of merit, zT ~0.2. Here, we demonstrate a maximum zT ~1.35 at 627 K in p&#8208;type polycrystalline rhombohedral (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1, which is the highest value reported among GeSe based materials. The rhombohedral phase is stable in ambient conditions for x = 0.8&#8208;29 in (GeSe)1&#8208;x(AgBiTe2)x. The structural transformation accompanies change from covalent bonding in orthorhombic GeSe to metavalent bonding in rhombohedral (GeSe)1&#8208;x(AgBiTe2)x. (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1 has closely lying primary and secondary valence bands (within 0.25 &#8211; 0.30 eV), which results in high power factor 12.8 &#181;Wcm&#8208;1K&#8208;2 at 627 K. It also exhibits intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (0.38 Wm&#8208;1K&#8208;1 at 578 K). Theoretical phonon dispersion calculations reveal vicinity of a ferroelectric instability, with large anomalous Born effective charges and high optical dielectric constant, which, in concurrence with high effective coordination number, low band gap and moderate electrical conductivity, corroborate metavalent bonding in (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1. We confirmed the presence of low energy phonon modes and local ferroelectric domains using heat capacity measurement (3&#8208;30 K) and switching spectroscopy in piezoresponse force microscopy, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>An affinity&#8208;based, cysteine&#8208;specific ATP analog for kinase&#8208;catalyzed crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinases mediate cell signaling pathways by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Irregularities in kinase activity is directly associated with disease conditions. Therefore, methods to identify substrates of a particular kinase are needed to understand signaling cascades in normal and diseased states. Photocrosslinking ATP analogs provide powerful tools to study kinases by covalently linking kinases with substrates. However, the involvement of UV light and nonspecific reactivity of current ATP&#8208;photocrosslinkers challenge kinase&#8208;substrate identification. We report here an affinity&#8208;based crosslinking ATP analog, ATP&#8208;methylacrylamide (ATP&#8208;MAc), that contains a cysteine&#8208;reactive acrylamide crosslinking group, which avoids the UV irradiation and non&#8208;specific reactivity of prior analogs. Using&#160;  in vitro  &#160;kinase assays, ATP&#8208;MAc acts as a kinase cosubstrate and covalently crosslinks only kinases containing cysteines in the active site. ATP&#8208;MAc was also able to crosslink cellular proteins in lysates, documenting compatibility with cell&#8208;based studies. Phosphorylation&#8208;dependent affinity&#8208;based crosslinking with ATP&#8208;MAc will have applications in kinase substrate identification to understand kinase&#8208;mediated cell signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective encapsulation of C60 by metal&#8208;organic frameworks with polyamide macrocyclic linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)&#8208; and zinc(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non&#8208;interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46%. Unlike metal&#8208;organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C  60  inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98% of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes  was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C  60  and C  70  .</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Reduction of Nanosized [6]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a naphthylene macrocycle, [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP,  1  ), with alkali metals, Li and K, revealed the accessibility of the doubly&#8208;reduced state of  1  . The macrocyclic  1  2&#8722;  anion was isolated in different coordination environments and crystallographically characterized.

         <title>Multinuclear Ag Clusters Sandwiched by Pt Complex Units: Fluxional Behavior and Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cluster Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinuclear Ag clusters sandwiched by Pt complex units were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR studies. The sandwich&#8208;shaped multinuclear Ag complexes showed two different types of fluxional behavior in solution: rapid slippage of Pt complex units on the Ag3 core and a reversible demetalation&#8211;metalation reaction by the treatment with Cl anion and Ag ion, respectively. The Ag2 complex obtained by demetalation reaction from the Ag3 complex displayed U to Z isomerization. These multinuclear Ag complexes showed strong photoluminescence whose properties depended on the existence of Pt&#8594;Ag dative bonds. The Ag3 complex, identified to be &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cluster&#8221;, was optically resolved by the formation of a diastereomeric salt with a chiral anion. The enantiomers show circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties which is unprecedented for compounds based on a chiral sandwich structure. Theoretical calculations allow to understand their structural features and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of sequence and base composition on the CD and TDS profiles of i&#8208;DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The i&#8208;motif DNA, also known as i&#8208;DNA, is a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure formed by cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, consisting of two intercalated parallel&#8208;stranded duplexes held together by hemi&#8208;protonated cytosine&#8208;cytosine  +  (C:C  +  ) base pairs. The growing interest for the i&#8208;DNA structure as a target in anticancer therapy increases the need for tools allowing a rapid and meaningful interpretation of the spectroscopic data of i&#8208;DNA samples. Herein, we analyzed the circular dichroism (CD) and thermal difference UV&#8208;absorbance spectra (TDS) of 255 DNA sequences by means of multivariate data analysis, aiming at unveiling peculiar spectral regions that could be used as diagnostic features during the analysis of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;forming sequences.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of axially chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyls with trialkylsiloxy (OSiR  3  ) groups were synthesized. Among them,  1a  &#8211;  c  possessing OSiR  3  groups at the 7,7&#8217;&#8208;positions and methyl groups at the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;positions were liquids at room temperature, and the neat liquids showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (R = Bu; &#934;  fl,liquid  = 0.21, |  g  lum,liquid  | = 1.6 &#215;&#160;10  &#8211;3  ). The |  g  lum,liquid  | value is the highest of pure liquids. These compounds remained liquid over a broad range of temperature, down to &#8211;50 &#176;C. TD DFT calculations indicated that in the excited state, the binaphthyls adopt a  transoid  conformation with a small angle between the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments (  &#952;  &#956;  ,  m  = 77&#176;), which is a key factor in their CPL&#8208;activity.

         <title>Ligand Strain and Its Conformational Complexity Is a Major Factor Determining Binding of Cyclic Dinucleotides to STING Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a key regulator of innate immunity that has recently been recognized as a promising drug target. STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) which eventually leads to expression of type I interferons and other cytokines. Factors underlying the affinity of various CDN analogues are poorly understood. Herein, we correlate structural biology, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and computational modeling to elucidate factors contributing to binding of six CDNs &#8211; three pairs of natural (ribo) and fluorinated (2'&#8208;fluororibo) 3,3&#8217;&#8208;CDN&#8217;s. X&#8208;ray structural analyses of six {STING:CDN} complexes &#8208; did not offer any explanation for different affinities of the studied ligands. ITC showed entropy/enthalpy compensation up to 25 kcal.mol  &#8208;1  for this set of similar ligands. The higher affinities of fluorinated analogues are explained with help of computational methods by smaller loss of entropy upon binding and by smaller strain (free) energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Wrapping of Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>

Taking advantage of the useful emitting features of two platinum complexes, we show how the media regulates the assembly pathways from self&#8208;sorting to an unprecedented reversible, dynamic molecular wrapping of a complex on another assembled structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly relies on the ability of smaller and discrete entities to spontaneously arrange into more organized systems by means of the structure&#8208;encoded information. Herein, we show that the design of the media can play a role even more important than the chemical design. The media not only determines the self&#8208;assembly pathway at a single&#8208;component level, but in a very narrow solvent composition, a supramolecular homo&#8208;aggregate can be non&#8208;covalently wrapped by a second component that possesses a different crystal lattice. Such a process has been followed in real time by confocal microscopy thanks to the different emission colors of the aggregates formed by two isolated PtII complexes. This coating is reversible and controlled by the media composition. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular simulations based on coarse&#8208;grained (CG) models allowed the understanding of the properties displayed by the different aggregates. Such findings could result in a new method to construct hierarchical supramolecular structures.

         <title>DNA Triplex and Quadruplex Assembled Nanosensors for Correlating K+ and pH in Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5453-5458, March 1, 2021. </description>

DNA quadruplex and triplex nanosensors are designed for simultaneously monitoring of K+ and pH by assembling upconversion nanoparticle luminophores and gold nanoparticle quenchers. Co&#8208;delivery of the two sensors with ATP stimulation indicates lysosomal acidification is accompanied with the efflux of K+.







Abstract
It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K+ and H+ in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can, respectively monitor K+ and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K+ and H+, respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200&#8197;mM&#8201;K+ and pH&#8197;5.0 to 8.2. Co&#8208;imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the influx of H+ was accompanied with the efflux of K+, solving this long&#8208;standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.

&lt;p&gt;It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can, respectively monitor K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200&#8197;mM&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and pH&#8197;5.0 to 8.2. Co&#8208;imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the influx of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was accompanied with the efflux of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, solving this long&#8208;standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Prebiotic Peptide Synthesis and Spontaneous Amyloid Formation Inside a Proto&#8208;Cellular Compartment</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organization in a system of fatty acids and activated amino acids leads to vesicle&#8208;encapsulated amyloids. The fatty&#8208;acid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. Hence, a simple mixture of prebiotically plausible starting materials leads to organizationally complex structures.







Abstract
Cellular life requires a high degree of molecular complexity and self&#8208;organization, some of which must have originated in a prebiotic context. Here, we demonstrate how both of these features can emerge in a plausibly prebiotic system. We found that chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids can lead to the formation of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibrils that are localized inside of a proto&#8208;cellular compartment. In this process, the fatty acid or lipid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanostructures: Surface Defects for Morphology&#8208;Driven Enhanced Semiconductor SERS</title>

The down&#8208;sizing of metal oxide semiconductors to ultrathin nanosheets creates intrinsic crystalline defects which alters the electronic structure of the semiconductor and activates SERS performance as a result of promoted charge&#8208;transfer efficiency and charge&#8208;transfer pathways.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors have recently become attractive candidate substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, exhibiting good semiconductor&#8208;based SERS sensing for a wider variety of application scenarios. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we propose that surface defects play a vital role in the magnification of the SERS performances of 2D semiconductors. As a prototype material, ultrathin WO3 nanosheets is used to demonstrate that surface defect sites and the resulting increased charge&#8208;carrier density can induce strong charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the substrate&#8208;molecule interface, thereby improving the sensitivity of the SERS substrate by 100 times with high reproducibility. Further work with other metal oxides suggests the reduced dimension of 2D materials can be advantageous in promoting SERS sensing for multiple probe molecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Intramolecular [4+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Arenes for the Synthesis of Diene Ligands</title>

A highly efficient strategy for the rapid assembly of bicyclooctadienes starting from simple diazo esters and EBX reagents through a one&#8208;pot sequential oxyalkynylation/ [4+2] allene&#8208;arene cycloaddition reaction at low temperature (23&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C) is reported. The obtained products are good chiral ligands for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition.







Abstract
The intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition between arenes and allenes first reported by Himbert gives rapid access to rigid polycyclic scaffolds. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot oxyalkynylation/cycloaddition reaction proceeding under mild conditions (23&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C) and providing complex polycyclic architectures with high efficiency, and atom and step economy. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene products were obtained with a wide variety of useful functional groups and were successfully applied as chiral ligands for metal catalysis. Computational studies gave a first rationalization of the low activation energy for the cycloaddition based on counter&#8208;intuitive favorable dispersive interactions in the transition state.

         <title>Highly Active Cooperative Lewis Acid&#8212;Ammonium Salt Catalyst for the Enantioselective Hydroboration of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5544-5553, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept for asymmetric hydroboration of ketones is shown, in which an ammonium halide initiates a hydride transfer to a Lewis acid activated ketone. Advantages of the bifunctional catalyst include remarkable turnover numbers (up to 15&#8201;400, 50&#8197;ppm catalyst) and high enantioselectivity. The catalyst was recycled 10 times still providing high efficiency. Mechanistic and DFT studies confirm the cooperative mechanism.







Abstract
Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high&#8208;value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type that allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15&#8201;400), which were increased by around 1.5&#8211;3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported. In our concept an aprotic ammonium halide moiety cooperates with an oxophilic Lewis acid within the same catalyst molecule. Control experiments reveal that both catalytic centers are essential for the observed activity. Kinetic, spectroscopic and computational studies show that the hydride transfer is rate limiting and proceeds via a concerted mechanism, in which hydride at Boron is continuously displaced by iodide, reminiscent to an SN2 reaction. The catalyst, which is accessible in high yields in few steps, was found to be stable during catalysis, readily recyclable and could be reused 10 times still efficiently working.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Biocatalytic MOF Microreactor as a Versatile Platform towards Enhanced Multienzyme and Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5421-5428, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous biocatalytic MOFs provide sufficient space for accommodation of enzymes to reorientate and spread in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion of reactants and intermediates. The promoted intermolecular correlation of enzymes and MOFs, and polyphenol coating, safeguards the enzymes from inactivation, showcasing their promise for diverse biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as excellent hosting matrices for enzyme immobilization, offering superior physical and chemical protection for biocatalytic reactions. However, for multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent biocatalysis, the subtle orchestration of enzymes and cofactors is largely disrupted upon immobilizing in the rigid crystalline MOF network, which leads to a much reduced biocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we constructed hierarchically porous MOFs by controlled structural etching to enhance multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme biocatalysis. The expanded size of the pores can provide sufficient space for accommodated enzymes to reorientate and spread within MOFs in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion rate of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability.

         <title>Simultaneous Dual&#8208;Gene Diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Based on CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Mediated Lateral Flow Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5307-5315, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay was developed and combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for simultaneous dual&#8208;gene diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. With this platform, the cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards, and nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples could be sensitively and specifically detected.







Abstract
Few methods for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 currently have the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Developed here is a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (Orf1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards, showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25&#8197;&#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab samples showed 100&#8201;% negative predictive agreement and 97.14&#8201;% positive predictive agreement. This platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.

         <title>Towards the Circular Economy: Converting Aromatic Plastic Waste Back to Arenes over a Ru/Nb2O5 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5527-5535, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
While plastic waste upcycling has attracted increasing worldwide concern, catalytic routes capable to convert a mixture of plastics selectively and effectively into useful chemicals remain exceedingly rare. Here, we report a salient example of the catalytic upgrading of various aromatic plastic waste to simple arenes in high yield via the selective cleavage of interunit C&#8722;O and C&#8722;C linkages.







Abstract
The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21st century owing to its disruptive impact on the environment. Here, we show the first example of the upgrading of various aromatic plastic wastes with C&#8722;O and/or C&#8722;C linkages to arenes (75&#8211;85&#8201;% yield) via catalytic hydrogenolysis over a Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single&#8208;component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to unique features including: (1)&#8197;the small sized Ru clusters on Nb2O5, which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2)&#8197;the strong oxygen affinity of NbOx species for C&#8722;O bond activation and Br&#248;nsted acid sites for C&#8722;C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.

         <title>Oxidation Under Reductive Conditions: From Benzylic Ethers to Acetals with Perfect Atom&#8208;Economy by Titanocene(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5482-5488, March 1, 2021. </description>

Oxidations with reducing agents? Fact and not fiction in a reaction featuring titanocene(III) catalysis, H&#8208;atom transfer, and an organometallic oxygen rebound. Acetals and hemiaminals can be readily prepared from benzylic ethers and amines, respectively, under mild reaction conditions and in high yields. The structures of the radical intermediates were elucidated by the CREST program.







Abstract
Described here is a titanocene&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of acetals and hemiaminals from benzylic ethers and benzylic amines, respectively, with pendant epoxides. The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single&#8208;electron steps. The oxidative addition comprises an epoxide opening. An H&#8208;atom transfer, to generate a benzylic radical, serves as a radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as a reductive elimination. The reaction mechanism was studied by high&#8208;level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low&#8208;energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity was deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures and their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and steric interactions between the titanocene catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. An interesting mechanistic aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.

         <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5363-5369, March 1, 2021. </description>

A strategy was developed for selective growth of isomeric covalent organic frameworks by designing monomer isomers and tuning reaction conditions. Three A2B2 type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p&#8208;, m&#8208;, and o&#8208;TetPB) afford five different 2D TetPB&#8208;COF isomers that exhibit selective adsorption of vitamin B12 owing to a great difference in their pore shape and size.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized A2B2 type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p&#8208;, m&#8208;, and o&#8208;TetPB) which have the para&#8208;, meta, and ortho&#8208;substituted isomeric structures, for the direct construction of isomeric frameworks. Interestingly, both kagome (kgm) and monoclinic square (sql) framework isomers are produced from either p&#8208;TetPB (C2h symmetry) or m&#8208;TetPB (C2v symmetry) by changing reaction solvents, while their isomeric structures are characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational simulation, microscopy, and sorption isotherm measurements. Only sql frameworks was formed for o&#8208;TetPB (C2v symmetry), irrespective of reaction solvents. These results disclose a unique feature in the framework structural formation, that is, the geometry of monomers directs and dominates the lattice growth process while the solvent plays a role in the perturbation of chain growth pattern. The isomeric frameworks exhibit highly selective adsorption of vitamin B12 owing to pore shape and size differences.

         <title>Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5467-5474, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced C(sp3)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation reaction of alkanes was developed by employing bpyCu(CF3)3 as a multifunctional reagent: photoinduced&#8208;reaction initiator, precursor of the hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reagent, and trifluoromethyl anion source (see scheme). The operatively simple reaction enables the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of complex molecules under mild reaction conditions.

A mild and operationally simple C(sp3)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation method was developed for unactivated alkanes by utilizing a bench&#8208;stable CuIII complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as the initiator of the visible&#8208;light photoinduced reaction, the source of a trifluoromethyl radical as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and the source of a trifluoromethyl anion for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by the generation of reactive electrophilic carbon&#8208;centered CF3 radical through photoinduced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, followed by hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C&#8722;CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical&#8211;polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The methylene&#8208;selective reaction can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.

&lt;p&gt;A photoinduced C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation reaction of alkanes was developed by employing bpyCu(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a multifunctional reagent: photoinduced&#8208;reaction initiator, precursor of the hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reagent, and trifluoromethyl anion source (see scheme). The operatively simple reaction enables the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of complex molecules under mild reaction conditions.

Abstract
A non&#8208;catalytic, mild, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle protecting group switched 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (1,3&#8208;DC) between bi&#8208; or mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected Dha and C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, which afford various quaternary amino acids with diverse scaffolds, is disclosed. Specifically, normal&#8208;electron&#8208;demand 1,3&#8208;DC reaction occurs between bi&#8208;N&#8208;protected Dha and C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, while inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand 1,3&#8208;DC reaction occurs between mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected Dha and C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines. Above all, the reactions can be carried out between peptides with Dha residues at the position of interest and C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, both in homogeneous phase and on resins in SPPS. It provides a new toolkit for late&#8208;stage peptide modification, labeling, and peptide&#8211;drug conjugation. To shed light on the high regioselectivity of the reaction, DFT calculations were carried out, which were qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.

A first crystal structure for a novel GCase activator is obtained and a novel non&#8208;inhibitory binding mode at a dimer interface, rationalizing the observed structure&#8211;activity relationship, is identified. Mechanistic insights and key information for future drug discovery efforts towards GCase activation are provided.







Abstract
Genetic, preclinical and clinical data link Parkinson's disease and Gaucher's disease and provide a rational entry point to disease modification therapy via enhancement of &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. We discovered a new class of pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine activators effecting both Vmax and Km. They bind to human GCase and increase substrate metabolism in the lysosome in a cellular assay. We obtained the first crystal structure for an activator and identified a novel non&#8208;inhibitory binding mode at the interface of a dimer, rationalizing the observed structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR). The compound binds GCase inducing formation of a dimeric state at both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal pHs, as confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, the pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines have central nervous system (CNS) drug&#8208;like properties. Our findings are important for future drug discovery efforts in the field of GCase activation and provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the requirements for enzymatic activation, pointing to the relevance of dimerization.

         <title>Unlocking the Water Trimer Loop: Isotopic Study of Benzophenone&#8208;(H2O)1&#8211;3 Clusters with Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5323-5330, March 1, 2021. </description>

The subtle discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical structures of the Ph2CO&#8208;(H2O)3 complex has been unveiled. An open&#8208;looped structure, instead of the cyclic structure, of the water trimer moiety above one of the &#960; clouds was determined by rotational spectroscopy.







Abstract
Examined here are the structures of complexes of benzophenone microsolvated with up to three water molecules by using broadband rotational spectroscopy and the cold conditions of a molecular jet. The analysis shows that the water molecules dock sideways on benzophenone for the water monomer and dimer moieties, and they move above one of the aromatic rings when the water cluster grows to the trimer. The rotational spectra shows that the water trimer moiety in the complex adopts an open&#8208;loop arrangement. Ab initio calculations face a dilemma of identifying the global minimum between the open loop and the closed loop, which is only solved when zero&#8208;point vibrational energy correction is applied. An OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond and a B&#252;rgi&#8208;Dunitz interaction between benzophenone and the water trimer are present in the cluster. This work shows the subtle balance between water&#8211;water and water&#8211;solute interactions when the solute molecule offers several different anchor sites for water molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclic &#960;&#8208;Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5400-5406, March 1, 2021. </description>

Anthracene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;congested cyclic dimer and tetramer were obtained using Ni(cod)2. These cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters exhibit narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, reflecting the face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance between the anthracene units. This &#960;&#8208;congestion endows the cyclic anthracene dimer with multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness such as photoisomerization and thermal reversion, accompanied by chromism, mechanochromism, and the photosalient effect.







Abstract
Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters which possess two and four anthracene units are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded a cyclic anthracene dimer as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. The cyclic anthracene dimer exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on the anthracene dimer affords its photoisomer having C&#8722;C bonds that are longer than 1.65&#8197;&#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of the photoisomer (colorless) to the original anthracene dimer (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.

The cyclic anthracene dimer exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on the anthracene dimer affords its photoisomer having C&#8722;C bonds that are longer than 1.65&#8197;&#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of the photoisomer (colorless) to the original anthracene dimer (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Acceptor Engineering for Optimized ROS Generation Facilitates Reprogramming Macrophages to M1 Phenotype in Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>

The ROS of type I mechanism generated from AIEgen photosensitizers can reeducate the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, leading to a complete ablation of the tumor without recurrence through single PDT treatment.







Abstract
Reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted immunotherapy. However, it remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms, relate to the macrophage polarization efficacy. Herein, we design and synthesize three donor&#8211;acceptor structured photosensitizers with varied ROS&#8208;generating efficiencies. Surprisingly, we discovered that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro&#8208;tumor type (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumor state (M1). In&#8197;vivo experiments prove that the photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth, while the therapeutic outcome is abolished with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the designing guideline of macrophage&#8208;activatable photosensitizers.

         <title>A Dual Role Reductase from Phytosterols Catabolism Enables the Efficient Production of Valuable Steroid Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5414-5420, March 1, 2021. </description>

An unusual reductase (mnOpccR) in phytosterol catabolism is found to catalyze the formation of 4&#8208;HBC through two different routes. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR leads to exclusive production of 4&#8208;androstenedione (4&#8208;AD) and 4&#8208;HBC from phytosterols. By a two&#8208;step synthesis, 4&#8208;HBC can be further efficiently converted into progesterone (PG). This work provides two green and economical methods for 4&#8208;AD and PG manufacturing.







Abstract
4&#8208;Androstenedione (4&#8208;AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues. In this study, we decipher a dual&#8208;role reductase (mnOpccR) in the phytosterols catabolism, which engages in two different metabolic branches to produce the key intermediate 20&#8208;hydroxymethyl pregn&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3&#8208;one (4&#8208;HBC) through a 4&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (3&#8208;OPC&#8208;CoA) and 2&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl aldehyde (3&#8208;OPA), respectively. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR in the Mycobacterium neoaurum can achieve exclusive production of either 4&#8208;AD or 4&#8208;HBC from phytosterols. By utilizing a two&#8208;step synthesis, 4&#8208;HBC can be efficiently converted into PG in a scalable manner (100 gram scale). This study deciphers a pivotal biosynthetic mechanism of phytosterol catabolism and provides very efficient production routes of 4&#8208;AD and PG.

         <title>Energy Efficient Ultrahigh Flux Separation of Oily Pollutants from Water with Superhydrophilic Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Architectures</title>

In this work we introduce the synthesis of a pillar&#8208;like Co&#8208;CAT&#8208;1 MOF nanoarchitecture on gold&#8208;coated woven stainless steel meshes. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature extreme superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity&#8208;driven, highly efficient oil&#8211;water separation with ultra&#8208;high flux of up to nearly one million L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The rising demand for clean water for a growing and increasingly urban global population is one of the most urgent issues of our time. Here, we introduce the synthesis of a unique nanoscale architecture of pillar&#8208;like Co&#8208;CAT&#8208;1 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystallites on gold&#8208;coated woven stainless steel meshes with large, 50&#8197;&#956;m apertures. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity&#8208;driven, highly efficient oil&#8211;water separation featuring water fluxes of up to nearly one million L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Water physisorption experiments reveal the hydrophilic nature of Co&#8208;CAT&#8208;1 with a total water vapor uptake at room temperature of 470&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations shed light on water affinity of the inner and outer pore surfaces. The MOF&#8208;based membranes enable high separation efficiencies for a number of liquids tested, including the notorious water pollutant, crude oil, affording chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations below 25&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of the effluent. Our results demonstrate the great impact of suitable nanoscale surface architectures as a means of encoding on&#8208;surface extreme wetting properties, yielding energy&#8208;efficient water&#8208;selective large&#8208;aperture membranes.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printing of Photoswitchable Actuators</title>

Shape&#8208;switching liquid crystal elastomers are formulated where light is used to trigger a shape change which is then stable indefinitely. The original shape can be recovered on heating. These materials can be 4D printed into reconfigurable Braille&#8208;like actuators capable of displaying letters &#8220;L&#8221;, &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221; by switching the shape&#8208;morphing of the Archimedean chord patterns with UV light and heating.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Herein, we 4D&#8208;print shape&#8208;switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks, and azobenzene. The salient property of shape&#8208;switching LCEs is that light induces long&#8208;lived, deformation that can be recovered on&#8208;demand by heating. UV&#8208;light isomerizes azobenzene from trans to cis, and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape&#8208;switching LCEs fix more than 90&#8201;% of the deformation over 3&#8197;days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape&#8208;switching properties, we print Braille&#8208;like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.

         <title>Engineered Enzymes Enable Selective N&#8208;Alkylation of Pyrazoles With Simple Haloalkanes</title>

Biological alkylation is highly selective, yet it depends on complex leaving groups. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes achieve selective enzymatic alkylation using simple haloalkanes. 







Abstract
Selective alkylation of pyrazoles could solve a challenge in chemistry and streamline synthesis of important molecules. Here we report catalyst&#8208;controlled pyrazole alkylation by a cyclic two&#8208;enzyme cascade. In this enzymatic system, a promiscuous enzyme uses haloalkanes as precursors to generate non&#8208;natural analogs of the common cosubstrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine. A second engineered enzyme transfers the alkyl group in highly selective C&#8722;N bond formations to the pyrazole substrate. The cosubstrate is recycled and only used in catalytic amounts. Key is a computational enzyme&#8208;library design tool that converted a promiscuous methyltransferase into a small enzyme family of pyrazole&#8208;alkylating enzymes in one round of mutagenesis and screening. With this enzymatic system, pyrazole alkylation (methylation, ethylation, propylation) was achieved with unprecedented regioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%), regiodivergence, and in a first example on preparative scale.

         <title>Biomimetic Amino Acid Functionalized Phenazine Flow Batteries with Long Lifetime at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>

A series of amino acid functionalized phenazines for AORFB negolytes have been synthesized and studied. The 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(phenazine&#8208;1,6&#8208;diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6&#8208;DPAP) full cell against a ferrocyanide posolyte with 1.0&#8197;M electron concentration has an OCV of 1.15&#8197;V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5&#8201;% per year.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising electrochemical technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. We report a biomimetic, ultra&#8208;stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6&#8208;AFPs display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6&#8208;AFPs possess ultra&#8208;high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(phenazine&#8208;1,6&#8208;diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6&#8208;DPAP) with ferrocyanide at pH&#8197;8 with 1.0&#8197;M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15&#8197;V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5&#8201;% per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox&#8208;active organics for robust redox&#8208;flow batteries.

         <title>Dimer Organization of Membrane&#8208;Associated NS5A of Hepatitis&#8197;C Virus as Determined by Highly Sensitive 1H&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5339-5347, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The membrane orientation of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein was assessed by combining a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis approach with highly sensitive 1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Insertion of lipids chelated with a paramagnetic Gd3+ ion allowed to orient the protein with respect to its membrane anchor using PRE. This information allowed to propose a model for the interaction of NS5A with a direct acting antiviral.







Abstract
The Hepatitis&#8197;C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane&#8208;associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct&#8208;acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane&#8208;bound NS5A structure. Herein, we present the structural model of an NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated through synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self&#8208;interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the first characterization of NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier&#8208;Hosting Potential Compensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5443-5452, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy magnesium hybrid full batteries were built by coupling a Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3 cathode with an FeVO4 anode in an aqueous/organic Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolyte. Benefiting from enhanced electrochemistry and carrier&#8208;hosting potential compensation, the batteries delivered a high voltage plateau and a capacity that is &#8805;1.75&#8208;fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from the electrochemistry and the low carrier&#8208;hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry through carrier&#8208;hosting potential compensation, high&#8208;energy Mg2+/Na+ hybrid batteries are achieved. A Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3 (MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4 (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, giving reliable high&#8208;voltage operation. This operation enables more sufficient (de)intercalation of hybrid carriers (Mg2+/Na+), thereby enhancing the reversible capacity remarkably (233.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1, 92.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1electrode, that is, &#8805;1.75&#8208;fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes). The relatively high Na+&#8208;hosting potential of the electrodes compensates for the low Mg2+&#8208;hosting potential and widens/elevates the discharge plateau of the full battery up to 1.50&#8197;V. Mechanism study further reveals an unusual phase transformation of FVO to Fe2V3 and the low&#8208;lattice&#8208;strain pseudocapacitive (de)intercalation chemistry of MVCP.

Phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel&#8208;conjugated lithocholic acid can form stable sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm nanomicelles (DTX&#8208;PC NMs). DTX&#8208;PC NMs exhibit superior tolerance and pharmacokinetics over FDA&#8208;approved formulation. DTX&#8208;PC NMs can retard tumor progression in murine models and induce upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. Superior pharmacokinetic profiling in non&#8208;human primates makes them an ideal platform for clinical applications.







Abstract
In this study, we describe the engineering of sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm nanomicelles (DTX&#8208;PC NMs) derived from phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel (DTX)&#8208;conjugated lithocholic acid (DTX&#8208;PC) and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;tethered lithocholic acid. Administration of DTX&#8208;PC NMs decelerate tumor progression and increase the mice survivability compared to Taxotere (DTX&#8208;TS), the FDA&#8208;approved formulation of DTX. Unlike DTX&#8208;TS, DTX&#8208;PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non&#8208;rodent species including non&#8208;human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX&#8208;PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression. Therefore, this unique system has the potential to improve the quality of life in cancer patients and can be translated as a next&#8208;generation chemotherapeutic.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Casbane Diterpenes: One Strategy, Multiple Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5316-5322, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cornucopia: Sessile soft corals as well as certain higher plants produce a multitude of casbane diterpenes with different oxygenation patterns. A new synthetic approach to this family of natural products (see structural framework) was designed that allows a large subset to be encompassed, yet is short, efficient, and selective. Key to success was a combination of catalytic cyclopropanation, alkyne metathesis, and trans&#8208;hydrometalation chemistry.







Abstract
Of the more than 100 casbane diterpenes known to date, only the eponymous parent hydrocarbon casbene itself has ever been targeted by chemical synthesis. Outlined herein is a conceptually new approach that brings not a single but a variety of casbane derivatives into reach, especially the more highly oxygenated and arguably more relevant members of this family. The key design elements are a catalyst&#8208;controlled intramolecular cyclopropanation with or without subsequent equilibration, chain extension of the resulting stereoisomeric cyclopropane building blocks by chemoselective hydroboration/cross&#8208;coupling, and the efficient closure of the strained macrobicyclic framework by ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis. A hydroxy&#8208;directed catalytic trans&#8208;hydrostannation allows for late&#8208;stage diversity. These virtues are manifested in the concise total syntheses of depressin, yuexiandajisu&#8197;A, and ent&#8208;pekinenin&#8197;C. The last compound turned out to be identical to euphorhylonal&#8197;A, the structure of which had clearly been misassigned.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5348-5356, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors is described through the hybridization of natural sulfopeptides produced by blood feeding organisms. The hybrid sulfopeptides were rapidly assembled using peptide ligation chemistry and shown to exhibit femtomolar inhibition constants against thrombin. A lead inhibitor also showed potent inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro, as well as antithrombotic effects in a murine model.







Abstract
Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one&#8208;pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against &#945;&#8208;thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein&#8211;protein interactions, in addition to an active site.

         <title>Opening Magnetic Hysteresis by Axial Ferromagnetic Coupling: From Mono&#8208;Decker to Double&#8208;Decker Metallacrown</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5299-5306, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic hysteresis of a metallacrown magnet opens after introducing axial ferromagnetic by linking two mono&#8208;decker Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] units with a single hydroxide bridge to give the double&#8208;decker {Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5]}2 single&#8208;molecule magnet in which the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are nearly collinear and the magnetic relaxation times are approximately 200&#8201;000 times slower than for the mono&#8208;decker unit.







Abstract
Combining Ising&#8208;type magnetic anisotropy with collinear magnetic interactions in single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is a significant synthetic challenge. Herein we report a Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] (1&#8208;Dy) SMM, where a DyIII ion is held in a central pseudo&#8208;D5h pocket of a rigid and planar Cu5 metallacrown (MC). Linking two Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] units with a single hydroxide bridge yields the double&#8208;decker {Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5]}2 (2&#8208;Dy) SMM where the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are nearly collinear, resulting in magnetic relaxation times for 2&#8208;Dy that are approximately 200&#8201;000 times slower at 2&#8197;K than for 1&#8208;Dy in zero external field. Whereas 1&#8208;Dy and the YIII&#8208;diluted Dy@2&#8208;Y analogue do not show remanence in magnetic hysteresis experiments, the hysteresis data for 2&#8208;Dy remain open up to 6&#8197;K without a sudden drop at zero field. In conjunction with theoretical calculations, these results demonstrate that the axial ferromagnetic Dy&#8211;Dy coupling suppresses fast quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM). The relaxation profiles of both complexes curiously exhibit three distinct exponential regimes, and hold the largest effective energy barriers for any reported d&#8211;f SMMs up to 625&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5357-5362, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals is reported. The system imparts consistently high stereoselectivity for the interception of a wide variety of radicals, including highly reactive primary radicals. The protocol also serves to develop radical cascade processes leading to stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general iminium ion&#8208;based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non&#8208;stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade reactions that combine an iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;based radical trap with an enamine&#8208;mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.

&lt;p&gt;An organocatalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals is reported. The system imparts consistently high stereoselectivity for the interception of a wide variety of radicals, including highly reactive primary radicals. The protocol also serves to develop radical cascade processes leading to stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.

         <title>1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level</title>

A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged furazans was prepared. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 shows great potential as a high&#8208;performance insensitive explosive. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.







Abstract
Many energetic materials synthesized to date have limited applications because of low thermal and/or mechanical stability. This limitation can be overcome by introducing structural modifications such as a bridging group. In this study, a series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged furazans was prepared. Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, infrared, elemental, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 has an excellent detonation performance (D=9101&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=37.9&#8197;GPa) and insensitive properties (IS=17.4&#8197;J, FS=330&#8197;N), which show its great potential as a high&#8208;performance insensitive explosive. Using quantum computation and crystal structure analysis, the effect of the introduction of the 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole moiety on molecular reactivity and the difference between the sensitivities and thermal stabilities of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole bridges are considered. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Dankasterones&#8197;A and B and Periconiastone&#8197;A Through Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5512-5518, March 1, 2021. </description>

A radical cyclization initiated by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) was used to construct the cis&#8208;decalin framework, further leading to the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones&#8197;A and B and periconiastone. Interconversion of dankasterone&#8197;B and periconiastone&#8197;A was observed.







Abstract
We describe herein the assembly of the cis&#8208;decalin framework through radical cyclization initiated by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT), further applied it in the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones&#8197;A and B and periconiastone&#8197;A. Position&#8208;selective C&#8722;H oxygenation allowed for installation of the necessary functionality. A radical rearrangement was adopted to create 13(14&#8594;8)abeo&#8208;8&#8208;ergostane skeleton. Interconversion of dankasterone&#8197;B and periconiastone&#8197;A was realized through biomimetic intramolecular aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions. The MHAT&#8208;based approach, serves as a new dissection means, is complementary to the conventional ways to establish cis&#8208;decalin framework.

Self&#8208;assembly of Ada&#8208;MOC and host&#8211;guest interaction with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) affords supramolecular nanoparticles. Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of Ada&#8208;MOC and PEI&#8208;&#946;CD maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling protein encapsulation into nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly (HAS) is a powerful approach to create supramolecular nanostructures for biomedical applications. This potency, however, is generally challenged by the difficulty of controlling the HAS of biomacromolecules and the functionality of resulted HAS nanostructures. Herein, we report a modular approach for controlling the HAS of discrete metal&#8211;organic cages (MOC) into supramolecular nanoparticles, and its potential for intracellular protein delivery and cell&#8208;fate specification. The hierarchical coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of adamantane&#8208;functionalized M12L24 MOC (Ada&#8208;MOC) and the host&#8211;guest interaction of Ada&#8208;MOC with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Ring Expansion of Cyclic Ketones to Macrolactones by Cerium and Cyanoanthracene Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Challenging macrolactones can now be modularly assembled through a photocatalytic aerobic oxidative ring expansion of cyclic ketones. With the assistance of an organophotocatalyst, &#945;&#8208;alkoxyketones can be transformed into macrolactones with 20&#8197;min of blue LED irradiation, ultimately enabling the rapid assembly of a large collection of structurally diverse lactones.







Abstract
We describe a cerium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative ring expansion for the expedient construction of synthetically challenging macrolactones under visible&#8208;light conditions. Cyanoanthracene has been employed as co&#8208;catalyst to accelerate the turnover of the cerium cycle leading to a fast conversion within 20&#8197;min of irradiation. Taking advantage of the high efficiency and operationally simple conditions, a collection of over 100 macrolactones equipped with ring systems ranging from 9&#8208; to 19&#8208;membered macrocycles have been prepared from simple building blocks. Moreover, the enabling potential of this strategy to simplify the generation of molecular complexity has been demonstrated through the concise synthesis of sonnerlactone.

A genetically encoded all&#8208;DNA nanomedicine with targeted gene regulation property was produced from E. coli after a range of bioprocessing. This study provides a new approach for production of DNA nanomedicines, which will greatly promote their clinical applications in the future.







Abstract
All&#8208;DNA nanomedicines have emerged as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. DNA nanotechnology provides all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines with unlimited possibilities in controlling the diversification of size, shape, and loads of the therapeutic motifs. As DNA is a biological polymer, it is possible to genetically encode and produce the all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines in living bacteria. Herein, DNA&#8208;dendrimer&#8208;based nanomedicines are designed to adapt to the biological production, which is constructed by the flexible 3&#8208;arm building blocks to enable a highly efficient one&#8208;pot DNA assembly. For the first time, a DNA nanomedicine, D4&#8208;3&#8208;As&#8208;DzSur, is successfully genetically encoded, biotechnologically produced, and directly self&#8208;assembled. The performance of the biologically produced D4&#8208;3&#8208;As&#8208;DzSur in targeted gene regulation has been confirmed by in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies. The biological production capability will fulfill the low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale production of all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines and promote clinical applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5459-5466, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of poor solvents are always not poor. Water and amphiphilic organic solvents (poor solvents), that individually promote the supramolecular polymerization of cationic &#960;&#8208;systems, readily depolymerize them into monomers in their mixtures (good solvent). Segregation of water and organic solvents around the molecular surface of the &#960;&#8208;system is the key for this surprising phenomenon.







Abstract
Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well&#8208;known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50&#8211;70&#8197;vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the &#960;&#8208;surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;Strong Acetylene Nano&#8208;trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5283-5288, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 nano&#8208;trap featuring the synergistic effect of multiple open metal sites has been proposed for separating C2H2/CO2 mixture gas. The unique C2H2 nano&#8208;trap shows the strongest binding interaction with C2H2 and a benchmark for C2H2/CO2 separation. The binding mechanism for C2H2 was studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and molecular simulation studies.







Abstract
Porous materials with open metal sites have been investigated to separate various gas mixtures. However, open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C2H2/CO2. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C2H2 molecules and separate C2H2/CO2 mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark Qst of 79.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for C2H2, a record high pure C2H2 uptake of 2.54&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;bar, and the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C2H2 and the separation of C2H2/CO2. The locations of C2H2 molecules within the MOF&#8208;based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C2H2.

Porphyrinic zirconium MOFs act as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain&#8208;end fidelity







Abstract
In this study, porphyrinic zirconium (Zr) MOFs were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Screening of various porphyrinic Zr&#8208;MOFs (Zn) containing Zn&#8208;metalled porphyrinic ligands demonstrated that MOF&#8208;525 (Zn) with the smallest size had the best photocatalytic activity in PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization, due to enhanced dispersion and light penetration. Oxygen tolerance and temporal control were also demonstrated during MOF catalysed PET&#8208;RAFT. Results suggested that the polymerization rates were significantly affected by changing the size and surface area of MOFs, and the heterogeneous MOF photocatalysts could be easily separated and recycled for up to five independent PET&#8208;RAFT polymerizations without an obvious decrease in efficiency. Finally, the MOF photocatalysts were utilized to create three&#8208;dimensional polymeric objects with high resolution via visible light mediated stereolithography in an open&#8208;air environment.

A multi&#8208;omics approach including proteomics, transcriptomics, and imaging was applied to comprehensively investigate the mode of action of the anticancer ruthenium(III) drug candidate BOLD&#8208;100. In their Communication on page&#8197;5063, Samuel&#8197;M. Meier&#8208;Menches, Christopher Gerner, and co&#8208;workers found the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as probable protein targets. They are functionally connected to endoplasmic reticulum stress, a key drug effect of BOLD&#8208;100.

All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. In their Communication on page&#8197;5193, Takaaki Sato, Noritaka Chida, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis, transformation, and biological tests of ANS derivatives. The key to success was a seven&#8208;step synthesis of ANSs by a sequential Overman rearrangement enabling formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups.

A novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitor is reported by Pedro&#8197;Jos&#233; Barbosa Pereira, Richard&#8197;J. Payne, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;5348. These inhibitors were rationally designed by hybridizing native sulfopeptide thrombin inhibitors from three different invertebrates: variegin from a bont tick, anophelin from the Anopheles mosquito, and TTI from the tsetse fly. When fused using bidirectional peptide synthesis and peptide ligation technologies the resulting hybrid inhibitors exhibited exquisite potency both in&#8197;vitro, with femtomolar inhibition constants, and in an in&#8197;vivo model of thrombosis.

Binary light&#8208;up aptameric sensors (BLAS) consist of two RNA or DNA strands and a fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associated, the two strands form a dye&#8208;binding site, followed by an increase in fluorescence of the aptamer&#8208;bound dye. This Minireview summarizes the state of the art in BLAS development and outlines perspectives and applications.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses the design and applications of binary (also known as split) light&#8208;up aptameric sensors (BLAS). BLAS consist of two RNA or DNA strands and a fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associated, the two strands form a dye&#8208;binding site, followed by an increase in fluorescence of the aptamer&#8208;bound dye. The design is cost&#8208;efficient because it uses short oligonucleotides and does not require conjugation of organic dyes with nucleic acids. In some applications, BLAS design is preferable over monolithic sensors because of simpler assay optimization and improved selectivity. RNA&#8208;based BLAS can be expressed in cells and used for the intracellular monitoring of biological molecules. BLAS have been used as reporters of nucleic acid association events in RNA nanotechnology and nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular computation. Other applications of BLAS include the detection of nucleic acids, proteins, and cancer cells, and potentially they can be tailored to report a broad range of biological analytes.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Enhancing Approaches for PEDOT:PSS&#8208;Si Hybrid Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5036-5055, March 1, 2021. </description>

This Review describes approaches to improve the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells. The main strategies include modifying PEDOT:PSS, optimizing the light&#8208;trapping effect, passivating the silicon surface, inserting an interface layer, and improving the back contact and the transparent conductive electrode.







Abstract
The emerging energy crisis has focused significant worldwide attention on solar cells. Although crystalline silicon solar cells are currently widely used, their high cost limits the development of solar power generation. Consequently, hybrid solar cells are becoming increasingly important, especially organic&#8208;Si hybrid solar cells (HSCs). Organic&#8208;Si HSCs combine a mature technology and high efficiency with the low&#8208;temperature manufacturing process and tunable optoelectronic properties of organic solar cells. The organic material can be P3HT, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and PEDOT:PSS. Here we review the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si HSCs and methods for improving their efficiency, such as PEDOT:PSS modification, optimization of the trapping effect, passivation of the silicon surface, addition of an interface layer, improvement of a back contact, and optimization of the metal top electrode. This Review should help fill the gap in this area and provide perspectives for the future development of the PEDOT:PSS/Si HSCs.

         <title>Advances in Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Probes for Isoform&#8208;Selective Imaging of Enzymatic Activity</title>

The development of isoform&#8208;selective activity&#8208;based probes enables the identification of enzyme activity within living systems. In this Minireview, key examples are highlighted and the relevance of isoform differentiation, design strategies, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Until recently, there were no generalizable methods for assessing the effects of post&#8208;translational regulation on enzymatic activity. Activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) has emerged as a powerful approach for monitoring small&#8208;molecule and enzyme activities within living systems. Initial examples of ABS were applied for measuring general enzymatic activity; however, a recent focus has been placed on increasing the selectivity to monitor a single enzyme or isoform. The highest degree of selectivity is required for differentiating between isoforms, where the targets display significant structural similarities as a result of a gene duplication or alternative splicing. This Minireview highlights key examples of small&#8208;molecule isoform&#8208;selective probes with a focus on the relevance of isoform differentiation, design strategies to achieve selectivity, and applications in basic biology or in the clinic.

Porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be designed and constructed for powerful biomedical applications. Recent progress and future expectations are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives have been widely explored for various applications owing to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties. However, inherent shortcomings, such as instability and self&#8208;quenching under physiological conditions, limit their biomedical applications. In recent years, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing attention. The construction of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs by introducing porphyrin molecules into MOFs or using porphyrins as organic linkers to form MOFs can combine the unique features of porphyrins and MOFs as well as overcome the limitations of porphyrins. This Review summarizes important synthesis strategies for porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs including porphyrin@MOFs, porphyrinic MOFs, and composite porphyrinic MOFs, and highlights recent achievements and progress in the development of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs for biomedical applications in tumor therapy and biosensing. Finally, the challenges and prospects presented by this class of emerging materials for biomedical applications are discussed.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Quinolines Enabled by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction**

The non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;heteroaromatics, quinolines, has been realized by using a well&#8208;defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 97&#8201;% ee and 3840 TON.







Abstract
The non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;heteroaromatics, quinolines, is reported. A new chiral pincer manganese catalyst showed outstanding catalytic activity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines, affording high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee). A turnover number of 3840 was reached at a low catalyst loading (S/C=4000), which is competitive with the activity of most effective noble metal catalysts for this reaction. The precise regulation of the enantioselectivity were ensured by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction.

A turnover number of 3840 was reached at a low catalyst loading (S/C=4000), which is competitive with the activity of most effective noble metal catalysts for this reaction. The precise regulation of the enantioselectivity were ensured by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Arylation for the Synthesis of Chiral Warped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5136-5140, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective Pd0&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation allows the synthesis of warped molecules possessing congested stereocenters. The polycyclic compounds were obtained in high yields and with good to excellent enantioselectivities using chiral bifunctional ligands and could serve to the bottom&#8208;up construction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
C&#8722;H activation&#8208;based ring&#8208;forming methods are a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter. Therefore, this strategy seems perfectly suited to address the synthesis of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, which are important target molecules in the field of organic electronic materials. Herein, we describe an enantioselective Pd0&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation protocol for the synthesis of chiral fluoradenes and other warped molecules, which could serve to the bottom&#8208;up construction of chiral PAHs. The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8211;carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity. The chiroptical properties of the obtained products were investigated, and some of them were found to have a strong ellipticity and an emission band located in the visible region.

The ability of the chloride anion to simultaneously bind a thiourea catalyst and a hydrazone nucleophile results in a highly ordered termolecular transition structure stabilized by a cooperative set of noncovalent interactions, ultimately resulting in an exquisite stereocontrol in the dearomatization of isoquinolines.







Abstract
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective thiourea&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization of isoquinolines employing N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydrazones as neutral &#945;&#8208;azo carbanions and masked acyl anion equivalents has been developed. Experimental and computational data supports the generation of highly ordered complexes wherein the chloride behaves as a template for the catalyst, the hydrazone reagent, and the isoquinolinium cation, providing excellent stereocontrol in the formation of two contiguous stereogenic centers. The ensuing selective and high&#8208;yielding transformations provide appealing dihydroisoquinoline derivatives.

         <title>A Photoregulated Racemase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5220-5224, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis isomer of an azobenzene&#8208;based artificial pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) racemase effectively deprotonates and racemizes L&#8208;alanine. A histidinyl unit bearing an imidazole group in close proximity to the racemizable C&#945;&#8208;H of the L&#8208;alanine aldimine residue is responsible for racemization using light as the stimulus. The trans isomer is less effective in terms of deprotonation and racemization.







Abstract
The racemase enzymes convert L&#8208;amino acids to their D&#8208;isomer. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise deprotonation&#8211;reprotonation mechanism that is assisted by a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) coenzyme. This work reports a PLP&#8211;photoswitch&#8211;imidazole triad where the racemization reaction can be controlled by light by tweaking the distance between the basic residue and the reaction centre.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Responsive Phytic Acid Nickel Biomimetic Complex Anchored on Carbon Nitride for Highly Efficient Solar Hydrogen Production</title>

An artificial photocatalysis system consisting of a carbon nitride polymer and phytic acid nickel biomimetic complex has been successfully constructed. It was adopted as an active and stable NIR harvesting photosystem toward scalable solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 production.







Abstract
A challenge in photocatalysis consists in improving the efficiency by harnessing a large portion of the solar spectrum. We report the design and realization of a robust molecular&#8208;semiconductor photocatalytic system (MSPS) consisting of an earth&#8208;abundant phytic acid nickel (PA&#8208;Ni) biomimetic complex and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The MSPS exhibits an outstanding activity at &#955;=940&#8197;nm with high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8&#8201;%, particularly &#955;&gt;900&#8197;nm, as it outperforms all reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art near&#8208;infrared (NIR) hybrid photocatalysts without adding any noble metals. The optimum hydrogen (H2) production activity was about 52 and 64 times higher with respect to its pristine counterpart under the AM&#8197;1.5&#8201;G and visible irradiation, respectively, being equivalent to the platinum&#8208;assisted PCN. This work sheds light on feasible avenues to prepare highly active, stable, cheap NIR&#8208;harvesting photosystems toward sustainable and scalable solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 production.

         <title>Cyclic Heterometallic Interactions formed from a Flexible Tripeptide Complex Showing Effective Antiferromagnetic Spin Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5179-5183, March 1, 2021. </description>

A cyclic CuII&#8208;NiII arrangement was efficiently formed using a flexible tripeptide and it exhibits effective antiferromagnetic spin coupling through the tripeptide amide groups.







Abstract
Developing tunable motifs for heterometallic interactions should be beneficial for fabricating functional materials based on cooperative electronic communications between metal centers. Reported here is the efficient formation of cyclic heterometallic interactions from a complex containing an artificial tripeptide with metal binding sites on its main chain and side chains. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the cyclic metal&#8211;metal arrangements arise from the amide groups connecting four square&#8208;planar CuII centers and four octahedral NiII centers in a cyclic manner. UV/Vis spectral studies suggested that this efficient formation was achieved by the selective formation of the square&#8208;planar CuII centers and a crystallization process. Magnetic measurements using SQUID clarified that the cyclic complex represented the S=2 spin state at low temperatures due to effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the NiII and CuII centers.

         <title>To Every Rule There is an Exception: A Rational Extension of Loewenstein's Rule</title>

According to Loewenstein's rule Al&#8722;O&#8722;Al motifs are energetically unstable in zeolites; here, using atomic scale simulations, the limitations of this rule are demonstrated and a rational extension is shown.







Abstract
Loewenstein's rule, which states that Al&#8722;O&#8722;Al motifs are energetically unstable, is fundamental to the understanding and design of zeolites. Here, using a combination of electronic structure calculations and lattice models, we show under which circumstances this rule becomes invalid and how it can be rationally extended using the chabasite framework for demonstration.

         <title>Behavior of Smart Surfactants in Stabilizing pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5235-5239, March 1, 2021. </description>

Newly structured smart surfactants, N+&#8208;(n)&#8208;N, were synthesized with a tertiary amine group at the end of the hydrophobic chain. At neutral and alkaline pH they behave as a cationic surfactant and can stabilize oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions alone or, together with charged nanoparticles, conventional Pickering, or oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions. In acidic media they turn to the Bola form, resulting in demulsification, returning into the aqueous phase which is then recycled when triggered by pH change.







Abstract
Newly structured pH&#8208;responsive smart surfactants (N+&#8208;(n)&#8208;N, n=14, 16) from alkyl trimethylammonium bromides are reported. In neutral and alkaline media N+&#8208;(n)&#8208;N behaves as a normal cationic surfactant and stabilizes conventional emulsions alone, as well as Pickering emulsions and oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions together with oppositely and similarly charged nanoparticles, respectively. In acidic media N+&#8208;(n)&#8208;N becomes a hydrophilic Bola&#8208;type surfactant, N+&#8208;(n)&#8208;NH+, and is an inferior emulsifier either when used alone or together with charged nanoparticles, resulting in demulsification. N+&#8208;(n)&#8208;NH+ returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the aqueous phase can be recycled when triggered by pH change. This protocol is a green process and leads to preparation of various temporarily stable emulsions which are often used in emulsion polymerization, heterogeneous catalysis, and oil transportation.

         <title>High&#8208;Preservation Single&#8208;Cell Operation through a Photo&#8208;responsive Hydrogel&#8208;Nanopipette System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5157-5161, March 1, 2021. </description>

The fabrication of photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette system ensures both precision single&#8208;cell operation and high cell preservation. Upon light&#8208;controlled, non&#8208;invasive operation, a high cell viability over 90&#8201;% as well as precise quantification of injection are obtained. Hence, a single&#8208;cell precise&#8208;dosing is achieved with a minimum lethal dose of 163&#8211;217&#8197;fg&#8201;cell&#8722;1.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell and in&#8197;situ cell&#8208;based operation with nanopipette approach offers a possibility to elucidate the intracellular processes and may aid the improvement of therapy efficiency and precision. We present here a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette hybrid system that can achieve single&#8208;cell operation with high spatial/temporal resolution and negligible cell damage. This strategy overcomes long&#8208;time obstacles in nanopipette single&#8208;cell studies as high electric potential (ca. 1000&#8197;mV) or organic solvent is always used during operations, which would inevitably impose disturbance and damage to targeted cells. The light&#8208;triggered system promotes a potential&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive single&#8208;cell injection, resulting in a well&#8208;retained cell viability (90&#8201;% survival rate). Moreover, the photo&#8208;driven injection enables a precisely dose&#8208;controllable single&#8208;cell drug delivery. Significantly reduced lethal doses of doxorubicin (163&#8211;217&#8197;fg&#8201;cell&#8722;1) are demonstrated in corresponding cell lines.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen at the Twisted Surface in a Mesoporous CeO2 Single Crystal for Efficient and Durable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5240-5244, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined active sites are created at the surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystals at the 2&#8197;cm scale. Complete CO oxidation with air at 67&#8201;&#176;C is demonstrated with no degradation observed after operation of 300&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well&#8208;defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2&#8197;cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at a continuously twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67&#8201;&#176;C without degradation being observed after operation of 300&#8197;hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well&#8208;defined active structures confined at the surfaces.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Promoted Self&#8208;Metalation of Porphyrins on an Oxide Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5078-5082, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of MgO is believed to be feasible only at defect sites. It is shown that this reaction is promoted by charge transfer and does not necessarily require the presence of defects. Using ultrathin MgO films as substrate and tuning its work function allows the charge and metalation state of the adsorbed molecules to be controlled.







Abstract
Metalation and self&#8208;metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self&#8208;metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.

Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Domino Effect: Gold Electrocatalyzing Lithium Reduction to Accelerate Nitrogen Fixation</title>

The key step of Li&#8208;mediated non&#8208;aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction. Gold greatly improved Li adsorption energy and thus highly accelerated the domino&#8208;like nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Green production of NH3, especially the Li&#8208;mediated electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in non&#8208;aqueous solutions, is attracting research interest. Controversies regarding the NRR mechanism greatly impede its optimization and wide applications. To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst. In&#8197;situ XRD confirmed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated spontaneous NRR. The Faradaic efficiency of NRR on Au/CP reached 34.0&#8201;%, and NH3 yield was as high as 50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our research shows that the key step of Li&#8208;mediated non&#8208;aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction and offers a novel electrocatalyst design method for Li reduction.

         <title>Multimodal Imaging of Autofluorescent Sites Reveals Varied Chemical Speciation in SSZ&#8208;13 Crystals</title>

A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to analyse emissive deposits. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits. Comparison of the distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume and XRF mapping is demonstrating that a fluorescence&#8208;based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.







Abstract
A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to show the distribution of and discriminate between different emissive deposits arising as a result of the detemplation process. Confocal imaging, 3D fluorescence lifetime imaging, 3D multispectral fluorescence imaging, and Raman mapping are used to show three different types of emissive behaviours each characterised by different spatial distributions, trends in lifetime, spectral signals, and Raman signatures. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits, which experience lifetime augmentation due to spatial confinement. The distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume is comparable to XRF mapping that shows Si enrichment on the outer edges and higher Al content through the centre, demonstrating that a fluorescence&#8208;based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.

         <title>Kinetic Barriers and Microscopic Mechanisms of Noble Gas Adsorption by Nanoporous &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2 Obtained by Means of Sub&#8208;Second X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>

The sub&#8208;second crystal structure analysis of noble gas uptake by nanoporous &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2 sheds light on its diffusion mechanisms and activation barriers. It resolves two kinetic barriers for noble gas adsorption: one with diffusion along the 1D channels and the other by diffusion between the channels via a smaller aperture.







Abstract
Gas adsorption by porous frameworks sometimes results in structure &#8220;breathing&#8221;, &#8220;pores opening/closing&#8221;, &#8220;negative gas adsorption&#8221;, and other phenomena. Time&#8208;dependent diffraction can address both kinetics of the guest uptake and structural response of the host framework. Using sub&#8208;second in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, three intracrystalline diffusion scenarios have been evaluated from the isothermal kinetics of Ar, Kr, and Xe adsorption by nanoporous &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2. These scenarios are dictated by two possible simultaneous transport mechanisms: diffusion through the intra&#8208; (i) and interchannel apertures (ii) of &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2 crystal structure. The contribution of (i) and (ii) changes depending on the kinetic diameter of the noble gas molecule and temperature regime. The lowest single activation barrier for the smallest Ar suggests equal diffusion of the atoms trough both pathways. Contrary, for the medium sized Kr we resolve the contributions of two parallel transport mechanisms, which tentatively can be attributed to the smaller barrier of the migration paths via the channel like pores and the higher barrier for the diffusion via narrow aperture between these channels. The largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier.

         <title>A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water Solubility and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5168-5172, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated carbanionic substituent enhanced both water solubility and lipophilicity of organic fluorescence dyes, including BODIPYs, fluorescein, and aminocoumarin, without impairing the photophysical properties of the parent fluorophores. Considering that incorporation of conventional ionic substituents reduces the lipophilicity, the present carbanion structure is a new and promising candidate to tune such macroscopic properties.







Abstract
Installation of a carbanionic substituent, that is strongly stabilized by two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (Tf=SO2CF3) groups, into several fluorescence dyes including boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), fluoresceins, and aminocoumarins has been achieved by the 2,2&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylation reaction of the dye frameworks with highly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, followed by neutralization with NaHCO3. Despite the contradiction between water solubility and lipophilicity, the carbanion&#8208;decorated dyes thus obtained showed significant enhancement of not only water solubility but also lipophilicity. This work clearly demonstrates that the fluorinated, highly stabilized carbanionic substituent is a new option for controlling the macroscopic property of chemical materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II pH Sensor with a FRET Adjustable Transition Point for In Situ Dynamic Tumor Microenvironment Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5091-5095, March 1, 2021. </description>

An adjustable pH transition point sensor is reported. It functions by regulating the FRET donor&#8208;acceptor ratio for dynamic pH visualization of a tumor through NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Monitoring the pH in tumor lesions provides abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity within a wider response region, reported here are serial pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) that simply regulate the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8211;7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38&#8211;6.94). With an adjustable pHt, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease processes could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging within the NIR&#8208;II window, with a coefficient of variation under 1&#8201;% compared to the standard pH meter.

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the pH in tumor lesions provides abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pH&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity within a wider response region, reported here are serial pH&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; adjustable sensors (pTAS) that simply regulate the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8211;7.22) is obtained compared to the pH&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; settled sensor (6.38&#8211;6.94). With an adjustable pH&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease processes could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging within the NIR&#8208;II window, with a coefficient of variation under 1&#8201;% compared to the standard pH meter.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5152-5156, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic properties of boron formazanate dyes are usually tuned by varying the substituents of the formazan moiety. We show that the wavelength and type of the lowest&#8208;energy electronic excitation of these compounds can also be modulated through variation of the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom.







Abstract
Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density&#8208;functional (DFT) calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the boron formazanate ring. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing optoelectronic materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles containing boron and other main&#8208;group elements.

         <title>Interaction with Ribosomal Proteins Accompanies Stress Induction of the Anticancer Metallodrug BOLD&#8208;100/KP1339 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5063-5068, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;omics analysis, including affinity proteomics, revealed that the anticancer drug candidate BOLD&#8208;100/KP1339 may target the ribosomal proteins RPL10/RPL24 and GTF2I. Swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the observation of polyribosomes using imaging techniques indicate that BOLD&#8208;100 treatment may not only inhibit proliferation, but also lead to a functional disturbance of the ER.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;based anticancer agent BOLD&#8208;100/KP1339 has shown promising results in several in vitro and in vivo tumour models as well as in early clinical trials. However, its mode of action remains to be fully elucidated. Recent evidence identified stress induction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concomitant down&#8208;modulation of HSPA5 (GRP78) as key drug effects. By exploiting the naturally formed adduct between BOLD&#8208;100 and human serum albumin as an immobilization strategy, we were able to perform target&#8208;profiling experiments that revealed the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as potential interactors of this ruthenium(III) anticancer agent. Integrating these findings with proteomic profiling and transcriptomic experiments supported ribosomal disturbance and concomitant induction of ER stress. The formation of polyribosomes and ER swelling of treated cancer cells revealed by TEM validated this finding. Thus, the direct interaction of BOLD&#8208;100 with ribosomal proteins seems to accompany ER stress&#8208;induction and modulation of GRP78 in cancer cells.

A concise total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkelic acid in eight linear steps was developed. This synthesis features a Catellani reaction/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade for the construction of the isochroman scaffold, a one&#8208;pot deprotection/spiroacetalization operation for the formation of tetracyclic core structure, and a late&#8208;stage Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling for the introduction of the lateral chain.

Reported here is a concise total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkelic acid in eight linear steps. This synthesis features a Catellani reaction/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade for the construction of the isochroman scaffold, a one&#8208;pot deprotection/spiroacetalization operation for the formation of the tetracyclic core structure, and a late&#8208;stage Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling for the introduction of the lateral chain. Notably, four stereocenters are established from a single existing chiral center with excellent stereocontrol during the deprotection/spiroacetalization process. Stereocontrol of the intriguing deprotection/spiroacetalization process is supported by DFT calculations.

Yaku'amide&#8197;A, an anticancer peptide, was synthesized by a route featuring a one&#8208;pot anti dehydration&#8211;azide reduction&#8211;O&#8594;N acyl transfer process for stereospecific construction of the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;&#916;Ile residues. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amino acids were produced by aminohydroxylation catalyzed by OsO4.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the anticancer peptide natural product yaku'amide&#8197;A is reported. Its &#946;&#8208;tert&#8208;hydroxy amino acids were prepared by regioselective aminohydroxylation involving a chiral mesyloxycarbamate reagent. Stereospecific construction of the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;&#916;Ile residues was accomplished through a one&#8208;pot reaction featuring anti dehydration, azide reduction, and O&#8594;N acyl transfer. Alkene isomerization was negligible during this process. These methods enabled a highly convergent and efficient synthetic route to the natural product.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Synthesis of Sulfonamides Directly from (Hetero)arenes, SO2, and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5056-5062, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent single&#8208;step synthesis of sulfonamides directly from (hetero)arenes, SO2, and amines by electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is presented. No prefunctionalization of the aromatic compound is required and halogen substituents are tolerated. The in situ formation of the amidosulfinate species serves a dual role as nucleophile and supporting electrolyte.







Abstract
Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non&#8208;prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO2 and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP&#8211;MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36&#8197;examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non&#8208;prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP&#8211;MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36&#8197;examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bidentate Iodine(III)&#8208;Based Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor as a Powerful Organocatalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5069-5073, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of a bidentate iodine(III)&#8208;based halogen bond donor as organocatalyst is presented. In three benchmark reactions, it markedly outperforms &#8220;classical&#8221; iodine(I)&#8208;based noncovalent organocatalysts. The bidentate mode of activation as well as the crucial relevance of halogen bonding are confirmed by comparison experiments.







Abstract
In contrast to iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bond donors, iodine(III)&#8208;derived ones have only been used as Lewis acidic organocatalysts in a handful of examples, and in all cases they acted in a monodentate fashion. Herein, we report the first application of a bidentate bis(iodolium) salt as organocatalyst in a Michael and a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction as well as in a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that had not been activated by noncovalent organocatalysts before. In all cases, the performance of this bidentate XB donor distinctly surpassed the one of arguably the currently strongest iodine(I)&#8208;based organocatalyst. Bidentate coordination to the substrate was corroborated by a structural analysis and by DFT calculations of the transition states. Overall, the catalytic activity of the bis(iodolium) system approaches that of strong Lewis acids like BF3.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed domino reductive cyclization of alkynes and o&#8208;bromoaryl aldehydes provided straightforward access to biologically significant indanones and spiroindanone pyrrolidine derivatives (see scheme). The reaction was found to be tolerant of a variety of functional groups and proceeded in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed domino reductive cyclization of alkynes and o&#8208;bromoaryl aldehydes is described. The reaction features broad substrate scope and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups, providing straightforward access to biologically significant indanones and spiroindanone pyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies have shown that indanones are formed by the cyclization of o&#8208;bromoaryl aldehydes and alkynes to form indenol intermediates, followed by hydrogen autotransfer.

         <title>Combining Incompatible Processes for Deracemization of a Praziquantel Derivative under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5279-5282, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (R) enantiomer of Praziquantel is more active against schistosomiasis (bilharzia, snail fever). The cheaper, commonly used, racemate can be deracemized via a conglomerate derivative to this enantiomer, which is obtained in 98&#8201;% ee using a flow system in which Pd&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;temperature racemization is coupled to low&#8208;temperature cycled crystallization.







Abstract
An efficient deracemization method for conversion of the racemate to the desirable (R)&#8208;enantiomer of Praziquantel has been developed by coupling incompatible racemization and crystallization processes. By a library approach, a derivative that crystallizes as a conglomerate has been identified. Racemization occurs via reversible hydrogenation over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) packed column at 130&#8201;&#176;C, whereas deracemization is achieved by alternating crystal growth/dissolution steps with temperature cycling between 5&#8211;15&#8201;&#176;C. These incompatible processes are combined by means of a flow system resulting in complete deracemization of the solid phase to the desired (R)&#8208;enantiomer (98&#8201;% ee). Such an unprecedented deracemization by a decoupled crystallization/racemization approach can readily be turned into a practical process and opens new opportunities for the development of essential enantiomerically pure building blocks that require harsh methods for racemization.

         <title>Hydrogen Purification through a Highly Stable Dual&#8208;Phase Oxygen&#8208;Permeable Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5204-5208, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantages of the high chemical stability and moderate reduction of Ti and Ce ions under reducing atmosphere, a novel Ti&#8208;based dual&#8208;phase oxygen&#8208;permeable membrane was developed for H2 purification. The Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;/Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3&#8722;&#948; (CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti) membrane has excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres.







Abstract
Using oxygen permeable membranes (OPMs) to upgrade low&#8208;purity hydrogen is a promising concept for high&#8208;purity H2 production. At high temperatures, water dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen permeates through OPM and oxidizes hydrogen in a waste stream on the other side of the membrane. Pure hydrogen can be obtained on the water&#8208;splitting side after condensation. However, the existing Co&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based OPMs are chemically instable as a result of the over&#8208;reduction of Co and Fe ions under reducing atmospheres. Herein, a dual&#8208;phase membrane Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;&#8208;Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3&#8722;&#948; (CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti) with excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres was developed for H2 purification. An acceptable H2 production rate of 0.52&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 940&#8201;&#176;C. No obvious degradation during 180&#8197;h of operation indicates the robust stability of CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti membrane. The proven mixed conductivity and excellent stability of CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti give prospective advantages over existing OPMs for upgrading low&#8208;purity hydrogen.

The palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective [3+2] annulation of amides with maleimides via the activation of ortho benzylic C&#8722;H and meta C&#8722;H bonds is reported. The presence of a 2&#8208;methylthiophenyl directing group is a key for the success of the reaction.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with maleimides via the activation of ortho benzylic C&#8722;H and meta C&#8722;H bonds is reported. Carboxamide and anilide type substrates that contain a 2&#8208;methylthiophenyl group both participate in this [3+2] annulation, indicating that the presence of a 2&#8208;methylthiophenyl directing group is a key for the success of the reaction. The first C&#8722;H bond activation at the benzylic C&#8722;H bond is followed by a second C&#8722;H bond activation at the meta C&#8722;H bond to give five&#8208;membered cyclic products. The cleavage of these C&#8722;H bonds is irreversible.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Hydroquinolines with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstitution through Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5268-5272, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution was realized through organocatalyzed asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates, which represents a powerful protocol for asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles with &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. Mechanistic studies elucidate the reaction mechanisms and highlighted the role of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst.







Abstract
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution has been achieved through asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest a monomeric catalyst pathway proceeding through rate&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining electrophilic attack promoted by a network of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst. Facile subsequent removal and transformations of the newly introduced hydrazine moiety enable these protocols to serve as powerful tools for asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution.

         <title>Atomically Precise Preorganization of Open Metal Sites on Gold Nanoclusters with High Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5225-5229, March 1, 2021. </description>

A stable Au23 nanocluster with preorganized open sites has been conducted through surface geometric mismatch strategy. The 35&#8201;% accessibility of Au23 was confirmed by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. The preorganized open sites make intact Au23 a high&#8208;performance catalyst for aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters with surface open sites are crucial for practical applications in catalysis. We have developed a surface geometric mismatch strategy by using mixed ligands of different type of hindrance. When bulky phosphine Ph3P and planar dipyridyl amine (Hdpa) are simultaneously used, steric repulsion between the ligands will reduce the ligand coverage of gold clusters. A well&#8208;defined access granted gold nanocluster [Au23(Ph3P)10(dpa)2Cl](SO3CF3)2 (Au23, dpa=dipyridylamido) has been successfully synthesized. Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au23 has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. This cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and demonstrates excellent stability due to the protection of negatively charged multidentate ligand dpa.

         <title>Photoresponsive Prion&#8208;Mimic Foldamer to Induce Controlled Protein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5173-5178, March 1, 2021. </description>

A photo&#8208;responsive prion&#8208;like foldamer is designed to act as spatio&#8208;temporal molecular template, which can be activated by selective photo&#8208;irradiation without changing other experimental conditions. It is able to induce a fast transition to the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation for aS monomers that undergo fibrillar polymerization. This method allows the study of protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases.







Abstract
Proteins reconfigure their 3D&#8208;structure, and consequently their function, under the control of specific molecular interactions that sense, process and transmit information from the surrounding environment. When this fundamental process is hampered, many pathologies occur as in the case of protein misfolding diseases. In this work, we follow the early steps of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (aS) aggregation, a process associated with Parkinson's disease etiopathogenesis, that is promptly promoted by a light&#8208;mediated binding between the protein and a photoactive foldamer. The latter can switch between two conformations, one of which generates supramolecular fibrillar seeds that act as molecular templates able to induce a fast &#946;&#8208;sheet transition for aS monomers that successively undergo fibrillar polymerization. The proposed method represents a powerful tool to study protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases in a controlled and inducible system.

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8211;N Coupling of Aryl Halides with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5230-5234, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8211;N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation and mild basic conditions, with no need for any external photosensitizers, offering a nitro version for the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#8211;N coupling reaction.







Abstract
A photochemical C&#8211;N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is demonstrated for the first time. Catalyzed by a NiII complex in the absence of any external photosensitizer, readily available nitroarenes undergo coupling with a variety of aryl halides, providing a step&#8208;economic extension to the widely used Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#8211;N coupling reaction. The method tolerates coupling partners with steric&#8208;congestion and functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via the addition of an aryl radical, generated from a NiI/NiIII cycle, to a nitrosoarene intermediate.

         <title>Triazenyl Alkynes as Versatile Building Blocks in Multicomponent Reactions: Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5147-5151, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazenyl alkynes serve as versatile building blocks in multicomponent reactions for diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino amides. The alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and the triazene group serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus to achieve both chemical reactivity and diastereoselectivity.

Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tool for the construction of polyfunctional molecules in an operationally simple and atom&#8208;economic manner, and the discovery of novel MCRs requests various building blocks. Herein, triazenyl alkynes were disclosed as versatile building blocks in a multicomponent reaction with carboxylic acids, aldehydes and anilines to furnish &#946;&#8208;amino amides with the achievement of high diastereoselectivity and structural diversity. In this process, triazenyl alkynes were bifunctional so that the alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and triazene serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus achieving high diastereoselectivity, in consistence with DFT calculations. Furthermore, the triazenyl group also enables diverse late&#8208;stage transformation. This protocol opens a new vision for the discovery of building block and rational design of MCRs.

&lt;p&gt;Triazenyl alkynes serve as versatile building blocks in multicomponent reactions for diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino amides. The alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and the triazene group serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus to achieve both chemical reactivity and diastereoselectivity. The triazene group also enables late&#8208;stage transformation. Diverse &#946;&#8208;amino amides were rapidly assembled in an operationally simple and atom&#8208;economic process.

The cluster compound [Mo3S13]2&#8722; is an interesting model system for hydrogen evolution catalysis. Herein, we probe the protonation site of the cluster by coupling mass spectrometry with infrared action spectroscopy. One distinct band at 2450&#8197;cm&#8722;1 together with DFT calculations and IRMPD kinetics reveals the nature of this S&#8722;H stretching vibration.







Abstract
Materials based on molybdenum sulfide are known as efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. As the binding site for H atoms on molybdenum sulfides for the catalytic process is under debate, [HMo3S13]&#8722; is an interesting molecular model system to address this question. Herein, we probe the [HMo3S13]&#8722; cluster in the gas phase by coupling Fourier&#8208;transform ion&#8208;cyclotron&#8208;resonance mass spectrometry (FT&#8208;ICR MS) with infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Our investigations show one distinct S&#8722;H stretching vibration at 2450&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Thermochemical arguments based on DFT calculations strongly suggest a terminal disulfide unit as the H adsorption site.

         <title>Role of Pyridinic Nitrogen in the Mechanism of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Carbon Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5121-5124, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) provides active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The roles of pyri&#8208;N in the ORR mechanism were investigated using pyri&#8208;N&#8208;containing molecules as model catalysts. In acidic media, pyri&#8208;N species were protonated to pyri&#8208;NH+ and then reduced upon the simultaneous thermal adsorption of O2. The reduction was accelerated by hydrophobic environments.







Abstract
The introduction of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) into carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is considered to create new active sites. Herein, the role of pyri&#8208;N in such catalysts was investigated from a mechanistic viewpoint using carbon black (CB)&#8208;supported pyri&#8208;N&#8208;containing molecules as model catalysts; the highest activity was observed for 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline/CB. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that in acidic electrolytes, both pyri&#8208;N atoms of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline could be protonated to form pyridinium ions (pyri&#8208;NH+). In O2&#8208;saturated electrolytes, one of the pyri&#8208;NH+ species was reduced to pyri&#8208;NH upon the application of a potential; no such reduction was observed in N2&#8208;saturated electrolytes. This behavior was ascribed to electrochemical reduction of pyri&#8208;NH+ occurring simultaneously with the thermal adsorption of O2, as supported by DFT calculations. According to these calculations, the coupled reduction was promoted by hydrophobic environments.

Multi&#8208;Layer &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules are designed to realize efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Spatially confined molecules with stereochemical structures are constructed in donor/acceptor/donor architectures with different conformations. Their organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices exhibit high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0&#8201;%/26.6&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacked emitters based on spatially confined donor/acceptor/donor (D/A/D) patterns have been developed to achieve high&#8208;efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this case, dual donor moieties and a single acceptor moiety are introduced to form two three&#8208;dimensional (3D) emitters, DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which rely on spatial charge transfer (CT). Owing to the enforced face&#8208;to&#8208;face D/A/D pattern, effective CT interactions are realized, which lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 94.2&#8201;% and 92.8&#8201;% for the two molecules, respectively. The resulting emitters exhibit small singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#916;EST) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) processes. Maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0&#8201;% and 26.6&#8201;% were realized for devices based on DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, respectively, which are higher than those of their D/A&#8208;type analogues.

         <title>N,N&#8208;Dialkylhydrazones as Versatile Umpolung Reagents in Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5102-5107, March 1, 2021. </description>

Networking for success: N,N&#8208;Dialkylhydrazones have been identified as versatile nucleophiles with multiple&#8208;networking ability to enable self&#8208;assembled chiral contact ion pair complexation for enantioselective anion&#8208;binding catalysis. The resulting network of highly ordered noncovalent interactions with the anion as a central template motif led to high enantiomeric induction in a model Reissert&#8208;type reaction with quinolines (see scheme).







Abstract
An enantioselective anion&#8208;binding organocatalytic approach with versatile N,N&#8208;dialkylhydrazones (DAHs) as polarity&#8208;reversed (umpolung) nucleophiles is presented. For the application of this concept, a highly ordered hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network between a carefully selected CF3&#8208;substituted triazole&#8208;based multidentate HB&#8208;donor catalyst, the ionic substrate and the hydrazone in a supramolecular chiral ion&#8208;pair complex was envisioned. The formation of such a network was further supported by both experimental and computational studies, which showed the crucial role of the anion as a template unit. The asymmetric Reissert&#8208;type reaction of quinolines as a model test reaction chemoselectively delivered highly enantiomerically enriched hydrazones (up 95:5 e.r.) that could be further derivatized to value&#8208;added compounds with up to three stereocenters.

         <title>Chemical Control of Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling and Charge Transfer in Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Ruthenium(IV) Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5184-5188, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites, A2RuCl6 and A2RuBr6, were studied. The synthesis, crystal structures, and optical and magnetic properties of the materials were determined. Differences in the halide and the A cation size influence the charge&#8208;transfer spectra. On the basis of temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic moments, accurate values were estimated for the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants of the RuIV d4 ion.







Abstract
Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites are attracting significant attention due to their chemical diversity and interesting optoelectronic properties. With a view to understanding both the optical and magnetic properties of these compounds, two series of RuIV halides are presented; A2RuCl6 and A2RuBr6, where A is K, NH4, Rb or Cs. We show that the optical properties and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) behavior can be tuned through changing the A cation and the halide. Within a series, the energy of the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer increases as the unit cell expands with the larger A cation, and the band gaps are higher for the respective chlorides than for the bromides. The magnetic moments of the systems are temperature dependent due to a non&#8208;magnetic ground state with Jeff=0 caused by SOC. Ru&#8208;X covalency, and consequently, the delocalization of metal d&#8208;electrons, result in systematic trends of the SOC constants due to variations in the A cation and the halide anion.

         <title>MgO&#8208;Template Synthesis of Extremely High Capacity Hard Carbon for Na&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5114-5120, March 1, 2021. </description>

Mg&#8208;templated hard carbon as an extremely high capacity negative electrode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze&#8208;dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose. The hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88&#8201;% at the first cycle. Owing to the low potential operation, estimated energy density of the full cell is very high.







Abstract
Extremely high capacity hard carbon for Na&#8208;ion battery, delivering 478&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze&#8208;dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose by a MgO&#8208;template technique. Influences of synthetic conditions and nano&#8208;structures on electrochemical Na storage properties in the hard carbon are systematically studied to maximize the reversible capacity. Nano&#8208;sized MgO particles are formed in a carbon matrix prepared by pre&#8208;treatment of the mixture at 600&#8201;&#176;C. Through acid leaching of MgO and carbonization at 1500&#8201;&#176;C, resultant hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88&#8201;% at the first cycle.

         <title>Ultrasound Controlled Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Polarization of Platelet Decorated Microglia for Targeted Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5083-5090, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize on&#8208;demand microglia polarization for controllable ischemic stroke therapy, a sono&#8208;sensitive hybrid microglia machine was prepared. Platelet membrane fused microglia have strong accumulation in cerebral vascular injury and can specifically polarize to anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotypes, upon external control by ultrasound irradiation, for angiogenesis and nerve regeneration, leading to survival and behavioral improvement of the stroke mice.







Abstract
Stroke is a lethal cerebral disease with severe sequelae and high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in the cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for strokes as its specific anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of microglia at the stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to the anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and realize on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization with ultrasound&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;4 liposome decoration. The intravenously injected microglia platform showed anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization at the stroke site with insonation, and accelerated the M2&#8208;type polarization of endogenous microglia for long&#8208;term stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis, and functional recovery, indicating the implications of the microglia platform for stroke therapy.

         <title>Seven&#8208;Step Synthesis of All&#8208;Nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5193-5198, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concise synthesis of all&#8208;nitrogenated sugar derivatives was achieved in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The sequential Overman rearrangement enabled formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in the monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs were available by the same synthetic route starting from different carbohydrates. Transformation and biological activities of ANS derivatives were also reported.







Abstract
All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.

         <title>Fast Enantio&#8208; and Chemoselective Arylation of Ketones with Organoboronic Esters Enabled by Nickel/N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5262-5267, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for general asymmetric addition of arylborons to simple ketones is reported, which is enabled by nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. Chiral tertiary alcohols are furnished with high efficiency and excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and chemocontrol, and the method offers a broad substrate scope.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A method for general asymmetric addition of arylborons to simple ketones is reported, which is enabled by nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. Chiral tertiary alcohols are furnished with high efficiency and excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and chemocontrol, and the method offers a broad substrate scope.

         <title>In Vitro Production of Ergothioneine Isotopologues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5209-5212, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an enzyme&#8208;based approach involving commercial isotope reagents, ergothioneine isotopologues with programmable 2H, 15N, 13C, 34S, and 33S isotope patterns were synthesized (see scheme). Such isotope&#8208;labeled ergothioneine derivatives are expected to be useful for deciphering the distribution, function, and metabolism of this compound in vivo. The labeling method is directly applicable to the synthesis of radio&#8208;isotopologues.







Abstract
Ergothioneine is an emerging component of the redox homeostasis system in human cells and in microbial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The synthesis of stable isotope&#8208;labeled ergothioneine derivatives may provide important tools for deciphering the distribution, function, and metabolism of this compound in vivo. We describe a general protocol for the production of ergothioneine isotopologues with programmable 2H, 15N, 13C, 34S, and 33S isotope labeling patterns. This enzyme&#8208;based approach makes efficient use of commercial isotope reagents and is also directly applicable to the synthesis of radio&#8208;isotopologues.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of O&#8208;Heteroacenes by Ladderization of Fluorinated Oligophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5199-5203, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;heteroacenes are now available by a one&#8208;step LOOP reaction by SET&#8208;induced SNAr&#8208;radical de&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation&#8208;SNAr. tBuOK serves as a reliable oxygen atom source and O2&#8722; synthon, enabling synthesis of dibenzofuran, benzoxanthenes, and benzooxepines, and a range of longer ladder&#8208;type O&#8208;heteroacenes from fluorinated oligophenylenes.







Abstract
A novel catalyst&#8208;free approach to benzoannulated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles from fluorinated oligophenylenes is reported. Unlike existing methods, the presented reaction does not require an oxygen&#8208;containing precursor and relies on an external oxygen source, potassium tert&#8208;butoxide, which serves as an O2&#8722; synthon. The radical nature of the reaction facilitates nucleophilic substitution even in the presence of strong electron&#8208;donating groups and enables de&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation required for the complete annulation. Also demonstrated is the applicability of the method to introduce five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered rings containing oxygen, whereas multiple annulations also open up a short synthetic path to ladder&#8208;type O&#8208;heteroacenes and oligodibenzofurans.

         <title>Enhanced Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins Assisted by Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Fused to DABCYL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intracellular delivery of synthetic native proteins is a challenge due to endosomal entrapment and subsequent degradation. We report the enhanced cellular uptake of fluorescently labelled synthetic proteins by attaching a newly developed cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) composed of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine linked to DABCYL.







Abstract
Live&#8208;cell delivery of a fully synthetic protein having selectivity towards a particular target is a promising approach with potential applications for basic research and therapeutics. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) allow the cellular delivery of proteins but mostly result in endosomal entrapment, leading to lack of bioavailability. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a CPP fused to 4&#8208;((4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) to enhance cellular uptake of fluorescently labelled synthetic protein analogues in low micromolar concentration. The attachment of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) modified with a single lysine linked to DABCYL to synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) and small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifier&#8208;2 (SUMO&#8208;2) scaffolds resulted in a threefold higher uptake efficacy in live cells compared to the unmodified cR10. We could also achieve cR10DABCYL&#8208;assisted delivery of Ub and a Ub variant (Ubv) based activity&#8208;based probes for functional studies of deubiquitinases in live cells.

         <title>The Development of a Fluorescence&#8208;Based Competitive Assay Enabled the Discovery of Dimeric Cyclic Peptide Modulators of Ubiquitin Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence&#8208;based competitive assay was developed, which enabled the high&#8208;throughput screening of various cyclic peptides targeting the Lys48&#8208;linked tetraubiquitin chain. This assay combined with chemical tools enabled the design of potent a dimeric cyclic peptide, which induced cell death with higher efficiency compared to its monocyclic analogue.







Abstract
Development of modulators targeting specific interactions of ubiquitin&#8208;based conjugates with their partners is a formidable task since it requires a suitable screening assay and homogeneous ubiquitin conjugates. We developed a novel high&#8208;throughput strategy for screening ligands for Lys48&#8208;linked tetraubiquitin chain in a relatively simple, fast, and affordable manner. This approach combined with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toolbox of chemical protein synthesis and a specially optimized Cys deprotection protocol enabled us to design highly potent, Lys48&#8208;linked tetraubiquitin chain selective &#8220;next generation&#8221; dimeric peptide modulators. The dimeric peptide exhibited cancer cell permeability and induced cell death with higher efficiency compared to its monocyclic analogue. These features make our dimeric peptide a promising candidate for further studies using in vivo models. Our assay can be adopted for other various ubiquitin chains in their free or anchored forms as well as conjugates for Ub&#8208;like modifiers.

We describe a challenging and straightforward asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;naphthylamine and 2&#8208;naphthol by using a CuI/SPDO/air system. Optically pure 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted NOBINs were achieved that could be readily derived to divergent chiral ligands/catalysts. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations give a comprehensive understanding of the high enantioselectivity and good chemoselectivity.







Abstract
A challenging direct asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;naphthylamine and 2&#8208;naphthol, using a novel CuI/SPDO system, has been successfully developed for the first time. Enantioenriched 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted NOBINs were achieved and could be readily derived to divergent chiral ligands and catalysts. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% ee) and good yields (up to 80&#8201;%). The DFT calculations suggest that the F&#8211;H interactions between CF3 of L17 and H&#8208;1,8 of 2&#8208;naphthol, and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the two coupling partners could play vital roles in the enantiocontrol of this cross&#8208;coupling reaction.

&lt;p&gt;We describe a challenging and straightforward asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;naphthylamine and 2&#8208;naphthol by using a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/SPDO/air system.

Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations give a comprehensive understanding of the high enantioselectivity and good chemoselectivity.

         <title>Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein**

Vitamin&#8197;K2 docked at the fatty acid site in the closed SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. Simulations indicate that ligands binding at this site stabilize the closed spike conformation.







Abstract
We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor&#8208;binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA&#8208;approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitamin&#8197;D); retinoids (some known to be active in vitro, and vitamin&#8197;A); and vitamin&#8197;K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Protected Metal Halide Perovskite Nanosheets with an Enhanced Set of Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate ligand synthetic strategy based on a linear amphiphilic PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PAA diblock copolymer prepared from RAFT polymerization enables the synthesis of PMMA&#8208;tethered CsPbBr3/TiO2 core/shell nanosheets (NSs). These NSs have markedly enhanced stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.), and thus potential applications in optoelectronic materials and devices.







Abstract
Approaches to achieve stable perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) of interest, in particular those with large structural anisotropy, through protective coating of the inorganic shell at a single&#8208;nanocrystal (NC) level are comparatively few and limited in scope. Reported here is a robust amphiphilic&#8208;diblock&#8208;copolymer&#8208;enabled strategy for crafting highly&#8208;stable anisotropic CsPbBr3 nanosheets (NSs) by in situ formation of a uniform inorganic shell (1st shielding) that is intimately ligated with hydrophobic polymers (2nd shielding). The dual&#8208;protected NSs display an array of remarkable stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.) and find application in white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes. In principle, by anchoring other multidentate amphiphilic polymer ligands on the surface of PNCs, followed by templated&#8208;growth of shell materials of interest, a rich variety of dual&#8208;shelled, multifunctional PNCs with markedly improved stabilities can be created for use in optics, optoelectronics, and sensory devices.

         <title>Operando Investigation of Ag&#8208;Decorated Cu2O Nanocube Catalysts with Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction toward Liquid Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2O nanocubes showed a remarkable increase (30&#8201;%) in the Faradaic efficiency for C2+ liquid products after the decoration with Ag nanoparticles. Operando spectroscopy revealed a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on CuOx as well as a certain Cu&#8211;Ag miscibility. These changes were coupled with significant variations in the binding of CO to Cu that favored the enhancement of the liquid product yields.







Abstract
Direct conversion of carbon dioxide into multicarbon liquid fuels by the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) can contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Here, well&#8208;defined Cu2O nanocubes (NCs, 35&#8197;nm) uniformly covered with Ag nanoparticles (5&#8197;nm) were synthesized. When compared to bare Cu2O&#8197;NCs, the catalyst with 5&#8197;at&#8201;%&#8197;Ag on Cu2O&#8197;NCs displayed a two&#8208;fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency for C2+ liquid products (30&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE), including ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, and acetaldehyde, while formate and hydrogen were suppressed. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu2O during CO2RR, accompanied by a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on the CuOx&#8197;NCs. Data from operando surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag&#8722;Cu sites formed during CO2RR that appear crucial for the C&#8722;C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.

         <title>Auxetic Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanostructures from DNA**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the first 2D auxetic nanoscale architectures using DNA origami. The structures show auxetic deformation behaviors with negative Poisson's ratios, which emerge from the periodic cellular configurations. A set of design guidelines are developed as the foundation for biomechanical metamaterials.







Abstract
Architectured materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with regular materials. Their auxetic behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the materials used. The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by top&#8208;down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we demonstrate two&#8208;dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations are performed by two&#8208;step DNA reactions and complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic DNA metamaterials.

         <title>Chemical Conversion and Locking of the Imine Linkage: Enhancing the Functionality of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The implementation of the reversible imine connection has been instrumental for the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, to ensure the generation of more robust, functional, and conjugated materials, alternative linkages based on the chemical locking and conversion of the imine bond have been devised. This Minireview focuses on examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards COFs beyond the imine linkage.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation. This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrooxidation of Urea: Intramolecular Coupling of the N&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During urea electrooxidation over a Ni(OH)2 electrode the dehydrogenation reaction from &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)O can lead to spontaneous urea dehydrogenation. Spontaneous intramolecular coupling of the N&#8722;N bond and hydration of urea dehydrogenation intermediates play important roles in the oxidation path from urea to N2 and CO2.







Abstract
The nitrogenous nucleophile electrooxidation reaction (NOR) plays a vital role in the degradation and transformation of available nitrogen. Focusing on the NOR mediated by the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, we decipher the transformation mechanism of the nitrogenous nucleophile. For the two&#8208;step NOR, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the bridge between electrocatalytic dehydrogenation from &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)O, and the spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenative oxidation reaction. This theory can give a good explanation for hydrazine and primary amine oxidation reactions, but is insufficient for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Through operando tracing of bond rupture and formation processes during the UOR, as well as theoretical calculations, we propose a possible UOR mechanism whereby intramolecular coupling of the N&#8722;N bond, accompanied by PCET, hydration and rearrangement processes, results in high performance and ca. 100&#8201;% N2 selectivity. These discoveries clarify the evolution of nitrogenous molecules during the NOR, and they elucidate fundamental aspects of electrocatalysis involving nitrogen&#8208;containing species.

         <title>Fatty Acids and their Derivatives as Renewable Platform Molecules for the Chemical Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin remain an important renewable feedstock for the chemical industry. Their industrial use has increased during the last 10 years from 31 to 51 million tonnes. Remarkable achievements made in the field of oleochemistry in this timeframe are summarized herein, including the reduction of fatty esters to ethers, the selective oxidation and oxidative cleavage of double bonds, the synthesis of alkyl branched fatty compounds, the isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarboxylation, and olefin metathesis. The use of oleochemicals for the synthesis of a great variety of polymeric materials has increased tremendously, too. In addition to lipases or phospholipases, other enzymes found their way into biocatalytic oleochemistry. Important achievements also generated new oil qualities in existing crop plants or by using microorganisms optimized by metabolic engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulation of Redox&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer by Interligand Hydrogen Bonding in a Cobalt Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octahedrally&#8208;coordinated cobalt(II) complexes with a redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and acac co&#8208;ligands were synthesized and their redox chemistry analysed in detail. Three different bisguanidines were used, exhibiting either fully or partially alkylated guanidino groups. The N&#8208;H functions in the ligand with partially alkylated guanidino groups form N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds with the acac co&#8208;ligands, thereby massively influencing the redox chemistry. For all complexes, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered, leading to Co  III  complexes with neutral bisguanidine ligand units. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation is ligand&#8208;centered in the case of Co&#8208;bisguanidine complexes with fully&#8208;alkylated guanidino groups, giving Co  III  complexes with radical monocationic bisguanidine ligands. On the other hand, the hydrogen&#8208;bond strengthening upon oxidation of the Co&#8208;bisguanidine complex with partially&#8208;alkylated guanidino groups initiates metal reduction (Co  III  &#8594; Co  II  ) and two&#8208;electron oxidation of the guanidine ligand, providing the first example for the stimulation of redox&#8208;induced electron transfer (RIET) by interligand hydrogen bonding. The results of this study demonstrate the huge impact of interligand hydrogen bonding on the outcome of redox reactions, providing the key for understanding the role of weak interactions in biological (enzymatic) redox processes and for a sophisticated control of redox&#8208;activity.</dc:description>

         <title>New Aldehyde&#8208;Functional Methacrylic Water&#8208;Soluble Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldehyde groups enable facile conjugation to proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides or fluorescent dyes, yet there are no literature examples of water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional vinyl monomers. Herein we report the synthesis of a new hydrophilic  cis  &#8208;diol&#8208;based methacrylic monomer (GEO5MA) by transesterification of isopropylideneglycerol penta(ethylene glycol) using methyl methacrylate followed by acetone deprotection via acid hydrolysis. The corresponding water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer, AGEO5MA, is prepared by aqueous periodate oxidation of GEO5MA at 22 &#176;C. RAFT polymerization of GEO5MA yields the water&#8208;soluble homopolymer, PGEO5MA. Aqueous periodate oxidation of the terminal  cis  &#8208;diol units on PGEO5MA at 22 &#176;C affords a water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional homopolymer (PAGEO5MA). Moreover, a library of hydrophilic statistical copolymers bearing  cis  &#8208;diol and aldehyde groups is prepared using  sub&#8208;stoichiometric  periodate/  cis  &#8208;diol molar ratios. The aldehyde groups on PAGEO5MA homopolymer are reacted in turn with three amino acids to exemplify synthetic utility, which is expected to offer new applications in the fields of cell biology and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new methodologies enabling a facile access to valuable heterocyclic frameworks still is an important subject of research. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle merging C&#8208;H alkynylation of phenols and oxy&#8208;alkynylation of the newly introduced triple bond by using a unique redox property and the carbophilic &#960; acidity of gold. Mechanistic studies support the participation of a bimetallic gold&#8208;silver species. The one pot protocol offers a direct, simple and regio&#8208;specific approach to 3&#8208;alkynyl benzofurans from readily available phenols. A broad range of substrates, including heterocycles, is transferred with excellent functional group tolerance. Thus this methodology can be used for the late stage incorporation of benzofurans.</dc:description>

Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>According to a first orientating view on the geometrical and electronic structure of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide, this anion appears as a&#160;Lewis&#160;base. Quantum chemical calculations on perfluoroalkylated silanides show significantly lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels in comparison to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, which implies reduced&#160;Lewisbasicity and increased&#160;Lewis&#160;acidity of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;&#160;ion. With these findings and a HOMO LUMO gap of&#160;4.80&#160;eV&#160;similar to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes (NHSi&#8217;s), perfluoroalkyl silanides are predestinated to exhibit&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric character similar to silylenes. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3H with sterically demanding phosphazene bases afforded thermally stable phosphazenium salts of the&#160;[Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;&#160;anion, which add to benzaldehyde, benzophenone, CS2&#160;and CO2in various manners. This behavior also mirrors the reactivity of silylenes towards ketones as well as heterocumulenes and is rationalized by&#160;Lewis&#160;amphotericity being inherent in these silanides.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Na&#239;ve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing Ru(II)(&#951;  6  &#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes  via  ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and  19  F NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Waxy Salts in Water: Synthetic Control of Hydrophobicity for Anion&#8208;Induced and Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that multipodal polycationic receptors function as anion&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitters in water. Prevailing paradigms utilize rigid holes and cavities for ion recognition. We instead built open amphiphilic scaffolds that trigger polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar environment transitions around cationic fluorophores upon anion complexation. This ion&#8208;pairing and aggregation event produces a dramatic enhancement in the emission intensity, as demonstrated by perchlorate as a non&#8208;spherical hydrophobic anion model. A synergetic interplay of C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion hydrogen bonding and tight anion&#8211;&#960;  +  contacts underpins this supramolecular phenomenon. By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level. With appropriate molecular design, inherently weak, ill&#8208;defined, and non&#8208;directional van der Waals interaction enables selective, sensitive, and tunable recognition in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Dinitrogen into Nitrile: Cross Metathesis of N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitride with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct synthesis of nitrile from N2  under mild conditions is of great importance and has attracted much interest. Herein, we report a direct conversion of N2  into nitrile via nitrile alkyne cross metathesis (NACM) process involving a N2&#8208;derived Mo nitride. Treatment of the Mo nitride with alkyne in the presence of KOTf afforded an alkyne coordinated nitride, which was then transformed into Mo(V)  carbyne and corresponding nitrile upon 1e&#8208;  oxidation. Both aryl and alkyl substituted alkyne underwent this process smoothly. Experiments and DFT calculations have proved that the oxidation state of Mo center played a crucial role. This method does not rely on the nucleophilicity of the N2&#8208;derived metal nitride, offering a novel strategy to the N2  fixation chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Design of a Polypseudorotaxane&#8208;based Sea Cucumber Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of integrated systems that mimic the multi&#8208;stage stiffness change of marine animals such as sea cucumber requires a synergistic design of molecularly tailored structures with considerations for efficient fabrication. In this work, we exercised an integrated biomimicry design and fabricated sea cucumber mimic using sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with tunable nano&#8208;to&#8208;macroscale properties. A series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;based sidechain copolymers were synthesized to form sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs). By tailoring the copolymers molecular weights and their PEG grafting densities, we rationally tuned the formed polypseudorotaxanes crystalline domain sizes and the physical crosslinking density of the hydrogels, which facilitated 3D printability and mechanical adaptability to these hydrogels. After 3D printing and photo&#8208;crosslinking, the obtained crosslinked hydrogels exhibited large tensile strain and broad elastic&#8208;to&#8208;plastic variations upon &#945;&#8208;CD (de)threading. These discoveries enabled a successful fabrication of a sea cucumber mimic demonstrating multi&#8208;stage stiffness changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Boration of Alkyl Halides with Borane without Hydrodehalogenation Enabled by Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented and general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8211;X, X = I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail  using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated carbon aerogel for fast and complete removing pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported selective electrochemical reduction of oxygen (O  2  ) to hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated by carbon aerogel (FeCoC). The graphite shell with exposed &#8211;COOH is conducive to the 2&#8208;electron reduction pathway for H  2  O  2  generation stepped by 1&#8208;electron reduction toward to &#183;OH. The electrocatalytic activity can be regulated by tuning the local electronic environment of carbon shell with the electrons coming from the inner FeCo alloy. The new strategy of &#183;OH generation from electrocatalytic reduction O  2  overcomes the rate&#8208;limiting step over electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle in Fenton process. Fast and complete removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5 min in this proposed system, the apparent rate constant (  k  obs  ) was up to 1.44 &#177; 0.04 min  &#8208;1  , which is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advanced oxidation processes. The degradation rate was almost remained the same after 50 successive runs, suggesting the satisfactory stability for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Refinery for Sustainable Production of Fuels and Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to modern fossil fuel&#8208;based industrial refineries, the emerging electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is a more sustainable and environmentally benign strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources to transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. E&#8208;refinery will promisingly lead to defossilization, decarbonization, and decentralization of chemical industry. A crucial step in conducting e&#8208;refinery processes is the selection and development of appropriate reactions and optimal electrocatalysts for efficient cleavage and formation of chemical bonds between H, O, C, and N. However, compared to well&#8208;studied primary reactions (e.g., O  2  reduction, water splitting), the mechanistic aspects and materials design for emerging complex reactions are yet to be settled. To address this challenge, herein, we first present concise and comprehensive fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these foundations to establish the framework of e&#8208;refinery with greater complexity by electrocatalytic coupling  in situ  generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We will also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways, and conclude with a perspective section to accelerate the development of feasible electrochemical industrial processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions between organozinc compounds and (hetero)aryl bromides have been reported when using bulk water as the reaction medium in the presence of NaCl or the biodegradable choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture. Both C(sp  3  )&#8211;C(sp  2  ) and C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  2  ) couplings have been found to proceed smoothly, with high chemoselectivity, under mild conditions (room temperature or 60&#176;C) in air, and in competition with protonolysis. Additional benefits include very short reaction times (20 s), good to excellent yields (up to 98%), wide substrate scope, and the tolerance of a variety of functional groups. The proposed novel protocol is scalable, and the practicability of the method is further highlighted by an easy recycling of both the catalyst and the eutectic mixture or water.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Electrocyclization of Poly(phenylacetylene)s: Unwinding Helices to Elucidate their 3D Structure in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s in solution was utilized to obtain important structural information that allows determine their helical structures (cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt;90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal (&#969;1&gt;90&#176;)) while it also provides an estimated value of &#969;1. When applied to mixtures, it allows the identification of the different helical scaffolds that coexist in solution.







Abstract
Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is used for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone. This method not only allows classification of PPAs in cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt;90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal structures (&#969;1&gt;90&#176;), but also approximating &#969;1. A PPA solution is illuminated with visible light and monitoring the photochemical electrocyclization of the PPA helix by measuring the ECD spectra at different times. PPAs with a cis&#8208;cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50&#8201;% before 30&#8197;min of irradiation, while cis&#8208;transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized. The different cis&#8208;cisoidal and cis&#8208;transoidal helices require different times to decrease their ECD signal by 50&#8201;% (t1/2), depending on the degree of compression or stretching of the helix, establishing a relationship between the secondary structure adopted by PPA (&#969;1) and the time required to lose the ECD vinylic signal by light irradiation.

         <title>Photogenerated Holes Mediated Nitric Oxide Production for Hypoxic Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated holes mediated oxidation was used to generate nitric oxide (NO) for hypoxic tumor treatment, which was achieved by poly&#8208;L&#8208;arginine modified carbon&#8208;dots&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (ArgCCN). The holes with oxidizability were generated by laser irradiation of ArgCCN, which oxidized H2O to generate H2O2, and the H2O2 further oxidized the arginine residues to accomplish the NO production that is independent of tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signal molecule with multiple physiological functions, and it also plays a key role in cancer therapy. However, the production of NO which depends on O2 or H2O2 is limited within the tumor microenvironment, leading to unsatisfactory anticancer effect. Herein, we report a NO&#8208;based phototherapeutic strategy mediated by photogenerated holes for hypoxic tumors, which is achieved by irradiation of the poly&#8208;L&#8208;arginine modified carbon&#8208;dots&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterial (ArgCCN). Upon red light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on ArgCCN oxidized water into H2O2 which subsequently oxidized the arginine residues to produce NO. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the high concentration of NO produced by ArgCCN could induce cancer cell apoptosis. The presented phototherapeutic strategy is based on microenvironment&#8208;independent photogenerated holes mediated oxidation reaction, paving the way for the development of NO therapeutic strategy.

         <title>Potential&#8208;induced spin changes in Fe/N/C electrocatalysts assessed by in situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercial success of the electrochemical energy conversion technologies required for the decarbonization of the energy sector requires the replacement of the noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts currently used in (co&#8208;)electrolyzers and fuel cells with inexpensive, platinum&#8208;group metal&#8208;free analogs. Among these, Fe/N/C&#8208;type catalysts display promising performances for the reduction of O  2  or CO  2  , but their insufficient activity and stability jeopardize their implementation in such devices. To circumvent these issues, a better understanding of the local geometric and electronic structure of their catalytic active sites under reaction conditions is needed. Herein we shed light on the electronic structure of the molecular sites in two Fe/N/C&#8208;catalysts by probing their average spin state with X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Chiefly, our  in situ  XES measurements reveal for the first time the existence of reversible, potential&#8208;induced spin state changes in these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming gels over a wide pH range using multicomponent systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent hydrogels offer a tremendous opportunity to prepare useful and exciting materials that cannot be accessed using a single component. Here, we describe an unusual multi&#8208;component low molecular weight gelling system that exhibits pH&#8208;responsive behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Unlike traditional acid&#8208;triggered gels, our system undergoes a change in the underlying molecular packing and maintains the &#946;&#8208;sheet structure both at acidic and basic pH. We further establish that autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows us to prepare gels with improved mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Slippage between&#160;&#951;2&#160;and&#160;&#951;1 Coordination in Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of linear late transition metal (M = Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]  &#8211;  containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The [B=C]  &#8211;  moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid&#8208;state, deviation between the &#951;  2  and &#951;  1  coordination mode occurs. The degree of slippage is greatest for Au &gt; Ag &gt; Cu. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]  &#8211;  ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the &#951;  1  coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar&#8208;Chatt&#8208;Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d  10  complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the p &#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the degree of slippage and hence substrate activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Photoswitchable Contrast Agents for Absolute 3D Temperature MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature can be used as clinical marker for tissue metabolism and the detection of inflammations or tumors. The use of magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for monitoring physiological parameters like the temperature noninvasively is steadily increasing. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study of MRI contrast agents (CA) for absolute and concentration independent temperature imaging. These CAs are based on azoimidazole substituted Ni(II) porphyrins, which can undergo Light&#8208;Driven Coordination&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching (LD&#8208;CISSS) in solution. Monitoring the fast first order kinetic of back isomerisation (  cis  to  trans  ) with standard clinical MR imaging sequences allows the determination of half&#8208;lives, that can be directly translated into absolute temperatures. Different temperature responsive CAs were successfully tested as prototypes in methanol&#8208;based gels and created temperature maps of gradient phantoms with high spatial resolution (0.13 x 0.13 x 1.1 mm) and low temperature errors (&lt;&#160;0.22 &#176;C). The method is sufficiently fast to record the temperature flow from a heat source as a film.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Amplification of Phosphoramidates of Amines and Amino Acids in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The origin of biomolecular homochirality continues to be one of the most fascinating aspects of prebiotic chemistry. Various amplification strategies for chiral compounds to enhance a small chiral preference have been reported, but none of these involves phosphorylation, one of nature&#8217;s essential chemical reactions. Here we present a simple and robust concept of phosphorylation&#8208;based chiral amplification of amines and amino acids in water. By exploiting the difference in solubility of a racemic phosphoramidate and its enantiopure form, we achieved enantioenrichment in solution. Starting with near racemic, phenylethylamine&#8208;based phosphoramidates, ee&#8217;s of up to 95% are reached in a single amplification step. Particularly noteworthy is the enantioenrichment of phosphorylated amino acids and their derivatives, which might point to a potential role of phosphorus en&#8208;route to prebiotic homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Excimer Formation and Solvent Controlled Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in the Excitonically Coupled Subphthalocyanine Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of the factors controlling excited state dynamics in excitonically coupled dimers and higher aggregates is critical for understanding natural and artificial solar energy conversion. In this work we report ultrafast solvent polarity dependent excited state dynamics of the structurally well&#8208;defined subphthalocyanine dimer, &#956;&#8208;OSubPc  2  . Stationary electronic spectra demonstrate strong exciton coupling in &#956;&#8208;OSubPc  2  . Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal ultrafast excimer formation from the initially excited exciton, mediated by intramolecular structural evolution. In polar solvents the excimer state decays directly through symmetry breaking charge transfer to form a charge separated state. Charge separation occurs under control of solvent orientational relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Field Stimulated Efficient Photocatalytic N2 Fixation over Defective BaTiO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient coupling solar energy conversion and N2  fixation by photocatalysis has been shown promising potentials. However, the unsatisfied yield rate of NH3  curbs its forward application. Herein, defective typical perovskite, BaTiO3  , shows remarkable activity under an applied magnetic field for photocatalytic N2  fixation with the NH3  yield rate exceeding 1.90mg/L/h. Through steered surface spin states and oxygen vacancies, the electromagnetic synergistic effect between the internal electric field and an external magnetic field is stimulated. X&#8208;ray absorption structure (XAS) spectrum and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the regulation of electronic and magnetic properties through manipulations of oxygen vacancies and inducements of Lorentz force and spin selectivity effect. The electromagnetic synergistic effect suppresses the recombination of photoexcited carriers in semiconducting nanomaterials, which acts synergistically to promote N2  adsorption and activation while facilitating fast charge separation under UV&#8211;vis irradiation. Therefore, this work offers a promising alternative route for exploring high&#8208;photocatalytic&#8208;property N2  fixation materials and shed light on stimulating the development of synergistic effect in photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal and pH stabilities of i&#8208;DNA: confronting in vitro experiments with models and in&#8208;cell NMR data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies indicate that i&#8208;DNA, a four&#8208;stranded cytosine&#8208;rich DNA also known as the i&#8208;motif, is actually formed  in vivo  ; however, a systematic study on sequence effects on stability has been missing. Herein, an unprecedented number of different sequences (271) bearing four runs of 3&#8208;6 cytosines with different spacer lengths has been tested. While i&#8208;DNA stability is nearly independent on total spacer length, the central spacer plays a special role on stability. Stability also depends on the length of the C&#8208;tracts at both acidic and neutral pHs. This study provides a global picture on i&#8208;DNA stability thanks to the large size of the introduced data set; it reveals unexpected features and allows to conclude that determinants of i&#8208;DNA stability do not mirror those of G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our results illustrate the structural roles of loops and C&#8208;tracts on i&#8208;DNA stability, confirm its formation in cells, and allow establishing rules to predict its stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrogenation of tetra&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Cobalt(II) Catalysis: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of  &#945;  ,  &#946;  &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of  di  &#8208; and  tri  &#8208;substituted unsaturated acids with noble metals has been well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging  tetra  &#8208;substituted  &#945;  ,  &#946;  &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. Herein, we demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of both cyclic and acyclic  tetra  &#8208;substituted  &#945;  ,  &#946;  &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids  via  cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98% yield and 99% ee). The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies collectively support a Co(II) catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and sigma&#8208;bond metathesis processes. In addition, our DFT calculations revealed that the enantioselectivity may origin from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides: Ultrafast and Selective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerizations Towards Well&#8208;defined Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polythioesters are popular polymers in virtue of their appealing performance such as metal coordination ability, high refractive indices, and biodegradability. One of the most powerful approaches for generating these polymers is the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers. However, the synthesis of precisely controlled polythioesters  via  ROP of thiolactones still faces formidable challenges, including the minimal functional diversity of available thiolactone monomers, as well as inevitable transthioesterification side reactions. Here we introduce a hyperactive class of S&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids that are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ROP.   Inclusion of the initiator PPNOBz ([PPN]=bis(triphenylphosphine)&#8208;iminium) with chain transfer agent benzoic acid, the polymerizations that can be operated in open vessels reach complete conversion within minutes (1&#8208;2 min) at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, &#160;retained stereoregularity  ,&#160;  and chemical recyclability. Most fascinating are the functionalized SCAs that allow the incorporating of functional groups along the polythioester chain and thus finely tune their physicochemical performance. Computational studies were carried out to explore the origins of the distinctive rapidity and exquisite selectivity of the polymerizations, offering mechanistic insight and explaining why high polymerizability of SCA monomer is able to facilitate exquisitely selective ring&#8208;opening for enchainment over competing transthioesterification and backbiting reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Competitive Aggregation Pathway of an Asymmetric Chiral Oligo(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene) Towards the Formation of Individual P and M Supramolecular Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complex aggregation pathway towards two diastereomeric  P  and  M  supramolecular helices arises from the aggregation of a short, chiral, and rigid oligo(phenyleneethynylene) [OPE, (  S  )&#8208;  1  ]. Thus, while  Agg  I  aggregate is obtained when a DCM solution of (  S  )&#8208;  1  is diluted with MCH at room temperature,  Agg  II  aggregate is generated only after a slow heating (353 K)/cooling (273 K) process. Interestingly, during  Agg  I  formation (mechanism 1), short  P  chain oligomers are produced, which have a great tendency to aggregate in plane, yielding brick&#8208;like nanostructures that halt the aggregation process. On the other hand, after a heating/cooling cycle, long  M  type columnar helical aggregates (  Agg  II  ) are obtained, formed by individual supramolecular polymer chains (mechanism 2) &#8212;easily visualized by AFM&#8212;. The two different  P  /  M  orientations obtained for  Agg  I  and  Agg  II  reveal the dynamic character of the system and its ability to create diastereomeric helical structures under the right conditions. Different experimental protocols were explored to prepare long  M  type columnar helical aggregates, which are not obtained by using the previous MCH/DCM 99/1 (v/v) solvent mixture. The generation of the desired  M  oriented supramolecular polymer is achieved when toluene is added to the solvent mixture in a 97/2/1 MCH/Tol/DCM (v/v/v) ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Phthalocyanine as Bioinspired Model for Chlorophyll f Containing Photosystem II Pushing Photosynthesis in the Far&#8208;Red</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Textbook explanation that P680 pigments are the red limit to drive oxygenic photosynthesis must be reconsidered by the recent discovery that chlorophyll f (Chlf) containing Photosystem II (PSII) absorbing in the far&#8208;red limit (FRL) at 727 nm can drive the four&#8208;electron water oxidation. The almost 110 meV energy drop from 680 to 727 nm is argued as the spare energy that is used to buffer the pulses in delta psi (the charge across the membrane) under variable light intensities. Two different families of unsymmetrically substituted Zn phthalocyanines (Pc) absorbing in the 700&#8208;800 nm spectral window and containing a fused imidazole&#8208;phenyl substituent (ZnPc I and ZnPc II) or a fused imidazole&#8208;hydroxyphenyl group (ZnPc I&#8208;OH and ZnPc II&#8208;OH) have been synthetized and characterized as bioinspired model of the Chlf /TyrosineZ/Histidine190 cofactors of PSII. Laser flash photolysis studies in presence of an electron acceptor and irradiating in the far&#8208;red region evidenced an intramolecular electron transfer process at an isoenergetic landscape scenario. Transient absorption and FT&#8208;IR signatures indicate the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded phenoxyl radical in ZnPc II&#8208;OH. This study sets the basis for the utilization of a broader spectral window for multielectronic catalytic processes with one of the most robust and efficient commercial dyes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus nanocages with distinctive platinum&#8208;group metals on the outer and inner surfaces can naturally catalyze at least two different reactions. Here we report a general method based on successive deposition and then selective etching for the facile synthesis of such nanocages. We have fabricated 11 different types of Janus nanocages characterized by a uniform size and well&#8208;defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6 nm thick. When tested as dual&#8208;electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and relative position of the metal layer. Density functional theory studies suggest that the alloy composition and surface structure of the nanocages both play important roles in enhancing the electrocatalytic activities by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>A self&#8208;catabolic multifunctional DNAzyme nanosponge for programmable drug delivery and efficient gene silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzyme&#8208;based genetherapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Zigzag Carbon Nanobelts through Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zigzag carbon nanobelts are a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after target for organic synthesis. Herein we report new strategies for designing and synthesizing unprecedented zigzag carbon nanobelts, which present a wave&#8208;like arrangement of hexagons in the unrolled lattice of (n,0) single wall carbon nanotubes (n = 16 or 24). The precursors of these zigzag carbon nanobelts are hybrid cyclic arylene oligomers consisting of  meta  &#8208;phenylene and 2,6&#8208;naphthalenylene as well as  para  &#8208;phenylene units. The Scholl reactions of these cyclic arylene oligomers form multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds selectively at the &#945;&#8208;positions of naphthalene units resulting in the corresponding zigzag carbon nanobelts. As monitored with fluorescence spectroscopy, one of these nanobelts binds C  60  with an association constant as high as (6.6&#177;1.1) &#215; 10  6&#160;  M  &#8722;1  in the solution in toluene. Computational studies combining linear regression analysis and hypothetical homodesmotic reactions reveal that these zigzag nanobelts have strain in the range of 67.5 to 69.6 kcal/mol, and the ladderization step through Scholl reactions is accompanied by increase of strain as large as 69.6 kcal/mol. The successful synthesis of these nanobelts demonstrates the powerfulness and efficiency of Scholl reactions in synthesizing strained polycyclic aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Crown Ether Struts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crown ethers are a class of macrocyclic molecules with unique flexible structures but they are rarely integrated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). To date, employing flexible organic units such as crown ethers to construct COFs with high crystallinity and surface area are still a challenge. In this work, two new COFs with different flexible crown ethers as backbone rather than side chains are synthesized and further employed for alkali metal ions separation. Both of COFs possess high surface areas, good crystallinity, and excellent chemical stability. Interestingly, these two new COFs with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 or 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 units showed remarkable binding ability of K  +  or Cs  +  owing to the size&#8208;fit effect. This work demonstrated that the unique structural features of crown ethers will lead to increase interest in fabricating COFs with crown ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>Isotopic labelling of confined carbyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne is by excellence the one&#8208;dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms bonded to each other with exceptional strength. Its outstanding mechanical, optical, and electronic properties have been theoretically predicted, but its stability has only been achieved when grown encapsulated in the hollow core of doublewalled carbon nanotubes. One of the advantages of this confinement is that its properties can be controlled by the chain's length and surrounding environment. We investigated an alternative way of gaining control of its properties is using isotope labelling as tuning mechanism. This approach has been proven successfully in the other allotropes of carbon (diamond, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene). However, no report on isotopic labelling of 1D sp  1  &#8208;hybridized carbon systems is available. A very long basic carbyne structure in pristine form, whose properties can be followed by the Raman spectral response, is the key ingredient to gain real tunability of carbyne. Here, the optimized liquid precursor was first chosen among several options, which can greatly enhance the yield of the long confined carbyne, then isotopic labelled liquid precursors were encapsulated inside carbon nanotubes as carbon source for further synthesis. This allowed us to obtain pioneering results on isotope engineered carbyne with around 11.9% of  13  C&#8208;labelling using  13  C&#8208;methanol as precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even duplicate the shell numbers with a narrow cavity between shells. Benefiting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP hollow multishell structures (HOMSs) with bubble&#8208;like shells and close duplicated shells can both form an effectively unique channel of water and gas, which can efficiently accelerate the entry of liquid and gas release.







Abstract
In the study of structure&#8211;property relationships for rational materials design, hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shell structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for enhanced capillary force. It can provide effective channels for water and gas and thus exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Catalysis in a MoS2 Monolayer Activated by Long&#8208;Range Ferromagnetism for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: Beyond Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possible way to trigger hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the basal&#8208;plane sites and make a MoS2 monolayer a single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalyst, is through long&#8208;range ferromagnetism order induced by magnetic cobalt ion doping. The effect of the doping promotes the hydrogen adsorption ability of basal S sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysts with fully activated basal&#8208;atoms will provide a solution to the low loading&#8208;density bottleneck of single&#8208;atom catalysts. Herein, we activate the majority of the basal sites of monolayer MoS2, by doping Co ions to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. This strategy, as revealed by in&#8197;situ synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50&#8201;% of the originally inert basal&#8208;plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS2 measured by on&#8208;chip micro&#8208;cell, a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved at the overpotential of 137&#8197;mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. Its exchange current density of 75&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 also surpasses most other MoS2&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show the activation of basal plane S atoms arises from an increase of electronic density around the Fermi level, promoting the H adsorption ability of basal&#8208;plane S atoms.

         <title>Strategies and Perspectives to Catch the Missing Pieces in Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.







Abstract
Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8208;OH) and their heterostructures (X|M&#8208;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.

         <title>Amine&#8208;to&#8208;Azide Conversion on Native RNA via Metal&#8208;Free Diazotransfer Opens New Avenues for RNA Manipulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA using the reagent FSO2N3 selectively provides azide&#8208;modified RNA in quantitative yields. The stereochemically controlled reaction opens new avenues for the synthesis of RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates and for the isolation of cellular RNA containing post&#8208;transcriptional nucleotide modifications with an aliphatic primary amino group, such as acp3U.







Abstract
A major challenge in the field of RNA chemistry is the identification of selective and quantitative conversion reactions on RNA that can be used for tagging and any other RNA tool development. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA containing an aliphatic primary amino group using the diazotizing reagent fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3). The reaction provides the corresponding azide&#8208;modified RNA in nearly quantitatively yields without affecting the nucleobase amino groups. The obtained azido&#8208;RNA can then be further processed utilizing well&#8208;established bioortho&#8208;gonal reactions, such as azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (Click) or Staudinger ligations. We exemplify the robustness of this approach for the synthesis of peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics and for the pull&#8208;down of 3&#8208;(3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U)&#8208; and lysidine (k2C)&#8208;containing tRNAs of an Escherichia coli tRNA pool isolated from cellular extracts. Our approach therefore adds a new dimension to the targeted chemical manipulation of diverse RNA species.

         <title>On the Redox Mechanism of Low&#8208;Temperature NH3&#8208;SCR over Cu&#8208;CHA: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Reduction Half Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of transient response, kinetic, and computational methods reveals the crucial role of dinuclear Cu complexes also in the Reduction Half&#8208;Cycle (RHC) of the LT&#8208;SCR redox chemistry over Cu&#8208;CHA, and it explains the observed quadratic dependence of the RHC rates on CuII.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;CHA is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of the nature of active Cu&#8208;ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Herein we address the redox mechanism underlying Low&#8208;Temperature (LT) SCR on Cu&#8208;CHA by an integration of chemical&#8208;trapping techniques, transient&#8208;response methods, operando UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the Reduction Half&#8208;Cycle (RHC) of LT&#8208;SCR display a quadratic dependence on CuII, thus questioning mechanisms based on isolated CuII&#8208;ions. We propose, instead, a CuII&#8208;pair mediated LT&#8208;RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite&#8208;precursor intermediates accounts for CuII reduction. These results highlight the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT&#8208;SCR, but also in the RHC reaction cascade.

         <title>The Reduced Nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] with Ge&#8722;Ge Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridogermanates(III), Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6], contain the hitherto unknown molecular anion [Ge2N6]12&#8722; featuring a Ge&#8722;Ge&#8208;bond and thus represent the first members of a novel class of compounds virtually unknown in the nitride chemistry of tetrel elements.







Abstract
The first nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] were synthesized from sodium flux and structurally characterized by powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. They crystallize isostructurally to each other and homeotypic to Ca6[Cr2N6]H in space group R
. They feature unprecedented, mutually isolated, ethane&#8208;like [GeIII2N6]12&#8722; anions in a staggered conformation. The compounds are semiconductors according to resistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations, yielding band gaps of 1.1&#8197;eV for Ca6[Ge2N6] and 0.2&#8197;eV for Sr6[Ge2N6].

         <title>Anodic Oxidation Enabled Cation Leaching for Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoCr2O4 activated at 1.7&#8197;V for 1.5&#8197;h (Act&#8208;CoCr2O4) exhibits better OER activity compared to IrO2 in alkaline solutions. Pristine CoCr2O4 is originally inactive; activation (&gt;1.56&#8197;V) promotes Cr leaching and lattice oxygen losses in CoCr2O4, leaving the highly defective surface for Co species to reconstruct into octahedrally coordinated Co3+&#8211;4+ oxyhydroxide.







Abstract
A rational design for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Much work has been devoted to understanding cation leaching and surface reconstruction of very active electrocatalysts, but little on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion. We now report controllable anodic leaching of Cr in CoCr2O4 by activating the pristine material at high potential, which enables the transformation of inactive spinel CoCr2O4 into a highly active catalyst. The depletion of Cr and consumption of lattice oxygen facilitate surface defects and oxygen vacancies, exposing Co species to reconstruct into active Co oxyhydroxides differ from CoOOH. A novel mechanism with the evolution of tetrahedrally coordinated surface cation into octahedral configuration via non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer is proposed. This work shows the importance of controlled anodic potential in modifying the surface chemistry of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Crystal Flexibility Design through Local and Global Motility Cooperation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible framework and its mobile aromatic substituents are connected via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. The flexibility integration endows the PCP with distinct guest&#8208;free structures depending on the activation approach. The flexible PCP discriminates C6 alkane isomers by different gate&#8208;open behaviors, suggesting its application potential on petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating.







Abstract
Incorporating local mobility into a flexible framework promises to create cooperative properties unattainable in a conventional soft porous crystal. In this study, we propose a design strategy that integrates substituent moieties and a flexible porous crystal framework via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This integration not only facilitates framework structural transitions but also gives the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) different guest&#8208;free structures that depend on the activation conditions. The incorporated flexibility gives the material the ability to discriminate C6 alkane isomers based on different gate&#8208;opening behaviors. Thus, the PCP has potential applications in C6 isomer separation, a critical step in the petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating. This strategy, based on ligand designability, offers a new approach to flexible PCP structural and functional design.

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss Achieved by a Pyridine&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine&#8208;based polymer semiconductor (PPY2) was introduced as the dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting material in inverted perovskite solar cells. It exhibits suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, effective passivation effects, and the capability of promoting the formation of a high&#8208;quality polycrystalline perovskite film. The devices based on PPY2 delivered an encouraging power&#8208;conversion efficiency up to 22.41&#8201;% with a high VOC of 1.16&#8197;V.







Abstract
Currently, the performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (VOC) loss caused by detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein, we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes inside perovskites and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), PPY2, which exhibits suitable energy levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of high&#8208;quality polycrystalline perovskite films. In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using PPY2 as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41&#8201;% with a small VOC loss (0.40&#8197;V), among the best device performances for inverted PVSCs reported so far. Furthermore, PPY2&#8208;based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long&#8208;term photostability, and over 97&#8201;% of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun constant illumination for 500&#8197;h.

         <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for &#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) obtained by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy could serve as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT). In addition, SnNSs could serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy (PTT) and &#946;&#8208;elemene delivery. This study not only presents a robust strategy for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri&#8208;modal combination cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non&#8208;invasiveness and high tissue&#8208;penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano&#8208;sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US&#8208;triggered separation of electron (e&#8722;)&#8208;hole (h+) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT&#8208;enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>Independent Luminescent Lifetime and Intensity Tuning of Upconversion Nanoparticles by Gradient Doping for Multiplexed Encoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lanthanide sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was studied. With gradient doping, independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning is realized.







Abstract
Luminescent materials with engineered optical properties have been developed for multiplexed labeling detection, where encoding capacity plays a pivotal role in the efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;The lanthanide sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was studied. With gradient doping, independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning is realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luminescent materials with engineered optical properties have been developed for multiplexed labeling detection, where encoding capacity plays a pivotal role in the efficiency. However, multi&#8208;dimensional optical identities are usually not independent which essentially hinder the practical encoding numbers to access theoretical capacity. In this work, we carefully studied the sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and managed to achieve independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning. With the orthogonally tunability, it breaks the constraint of intensity (k) and lifetime (n) correlation and expands the practical encoding number to theoretical value as (k+1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;1 in binary encoding. This method can also be combined with previous lifetime engineering as well to realize high level multiplexing.&lt;/p&gt;
