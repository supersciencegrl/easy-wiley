         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to the silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, low catalyst loading (0.1 mol% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Al&#8208;Al Dual&#8208;Atomic Site for Efficient Artificial Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of ammonia by electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is commonly obstructed by the high activation energy. Here, we report the design and synthesis of an Al&#8208;Al bonded dual atomic catalyst stabilized within an amorphous nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix (Al2NC) with high NRR performance. The dual atomic Al2&#8208;sites act synergistically to catalyze the complex multiple steps of NRR through adsorption and activation, enhancing the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This Al2NC catalyst exhibits a high Faradic efficiency of 16.56&#177;0.3% with a yield rate of 29.22&#177;1.2 &#181;g.h&#8208;1.mgcat&#8208;1. The dual atomic Al2NC catalyst shows long&#8208;term repeatable, and stable NRR performance. This work presents an insight into the identification of synergistic dual atomic catalytic site and mechanistic pathway for the electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective methodology to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion; while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of ensemble of all structural changes. As kobs &gt;&gt; kc, it allows us to decouple the overall molecular motions into a slow configurational transformation and rapid conformational interconversions, the latter further dissected into two independent conformational interchanges, namely (P)&#8208;C3 &#8644; (M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1 &#8644; (M)&#8208;C1. This work therefore sheds light on comprehensive kinetic study of complex molecular dynamics, offering valuable insights for the rational design of smart dynamic materials for applications of sensing, separation, catalysis, molecular machinery, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;selective Deoxygenative Coupling of Aliphatic Alcohols: Installation of Methyl Groups including Isotopic Labels by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions of two aliphatic alcohol derivatives remain a challenge. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive methylation reaction of aliphatic mesylates with methyl tosylate. This reaction provides straightforward access to compounds bearing aliphatic methyl groups from alkyl alcohol derivatives. Isotopically labelled substrates and reagents can be employed in the reaction to provide perdeuterated and 13C&#8208;labelled products. This transformation can be achieved by employing stoichiometric Mn reductant or electrochemically. Additionally, mechanistic experiments show that alkyl iodides are key intermediates in the transformation which undergo a stereoablative reaction via radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Commercializable Naphthalene Diimide Anolytes for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) hold the potential to facilitate the transition of renewable energy sources from auxiliary to primary energy, the commercial production of anolyte materials still suffers from insufficient performance of high&#8208;concentration and the high cost of the preparation problem. To overcome these challenges, this study provides a hydrothermal synthesis methodology and introduces the charged functional groups into hydrophobic naphthalene diimide cores, and prepares a series of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide anolytes. Under the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, the naphthalene diimide exhibits excellent structural stability and the highest water solubility (1.85 M for dex&#8208;NDI) reported to date. By employing the hydrothermal method, low&#8208;cost naphthalene diimides are successfully synthesized on a hundred&#8208;gram scale&#160;of $0.16 g&#8208;1 ($2.43 Ah&#8208;1), which is also the lowest price reported to date. The constructed full battery achieves a high electron concentration of 2.4 M, a high capacity of 54.4 Ah L&#8208;1, and a power density of 318 mW cm&#8208;2 with no significant capacity decay observed during long&#8208;duration cycling. These findings provide crucial support for the commercialization of AORFBs and pave the way for revolutionary developments in neutral AORFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy&#8208;Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi&#8208;Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy&#8208;transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly&#8208;borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy&#8208;transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of poly&#8208;borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly&#8208;borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1&#8208;di&#8208;, 1,1,2&#8208;tri&#8208;, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. Mechanistic deuterium&#8208;labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;&#8208;lactones.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/alkylmetal interception reaction in which products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. This method offers a convenient route to access 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles, 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;arylalkanols with the formation of C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds at primary and secondary alkyl carbon centers. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8208;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes. A silicon motif in the cyclic C(sp3)&#8208;Si&#8208;O construct in 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles can also be selectively deleted by Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrodesilylation affording Si&#8208;ablated linear alcohol products reminiscent of vicinal ethylene dicarbofunctionalization with C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Ice Microstructures and Hydration States of Acridinium Iodide Studied by Phosphorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ice has been suggested to have played a significant role in the origin of life partly owing to its ability to concentrate organic molecules and promote reaction efficiency. However, the techniques for studying organic molecules in ice are absorption&#8208;based, which limits the sensitivity of measurements. Here we introduce an emission&#8208;based method to study organic molecules in water ice: the phosphorescence displays high sensitivity depending on the hydration state of an organic salt probe, acridinium iodide (ADI). The designed ADI aqueous system exhibits phosphorescence that can be severely perturbed when the temperature is higher than 110 K at a concentration of the order of 10&#8208;5M, indicating changes in hydration for ADI. Using the ADI phosphorescent probe, it is found that the microstructures of water ice, i.e., crystalline vs. glassy, can be strongly dictated by a trace amount (as low as 10&#8208;5M) of water&#8208;soluble organic molecules. Consistent with cryoSEM images and temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectral data, the ADI is dehydrated in more crystalline ice and hydrated in more glassy ice. The current investigation serves as a starting point for using more sensitive spectroscopic techniques for studying water&#8208;organics interactions at a much lower concentration and wider temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution in Neutral Media by Differential Intermediate Binding at Charge&#8208;Modulated Sites of a Bimetallic Alloy Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential binding of H* and OH* on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of amorphous Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 50&#177;9&#8197;mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential intermediate binding on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam (NF), where the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1&#8197;M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is only 50&#177;9&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It has a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1, mass activity of 13.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;200&#8197;mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and produces 16&#8197;ml H2 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;300&#8197;mV vs. RHE, more than double that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C. The Mo&#948;+ and Co&#948;&#8722; sites adsorb OH*, and H*, respectively, and the electron injection from Co to H&#8722;O&#8722;H cleaves the O&#8722;H bond to form the Mo&#8722;OH* intermediate. Operando spectral analyses indicate a weak H&#8208;bonded network for facilitating the H2O*/OH* transport, and a potential&#8208;induced reversal of the charge density from Co to the more electronegative Mo, because of the electron withdrawing Co&#8722;H* and Mo&#8722;OH* species. Co85Mo15/NF can also drive the complete electrolysis of neutral water at only 1.73&#8197;V (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In alkaline, and acidic media, it demonstrates a Pt&#8208;like HER activity, accomplishing &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 161&#177;7, and 175&#177;22&#8197;mV, respectively.

         <title>Directed Electron Delivery from a Pb&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite to a Co(II) Molecular Catalyst Boosts CO2 Photoreduction Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal halide photocatalyst immobilized with a molecular catalyst achieves an optimal performance for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, which mainly benefits from the rapid directional electron transfer from the metal halide to the catalyst via its carboxyl anchors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is appealing to address energy and environmental issues, while it is challenging to avoid using toxic metals and organic sacrificial reagents. We here immobilize a family of cobalt phthalocyanine catalysts on Pb&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets with delicate control on the anchors of the cobalt catalysts. Among them, the molecular hybrid photocatalyst assembled by carboxyl anchors achieves the optimal performance with an electron consumption rate of 300&#177;13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, over 8&#8197;times of the unmodified Cs2AgBiBr6 (36&#177;8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), also far surpassing the documented systems (&lt;150&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Besides the improved intrinsic activity, electrochemical, computational, ex&#8208;/in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic results indicate that the electrons photogenerated at the Bi atoms of Cs2AgBiBr6 can be directionally transferred to the cobalt catalyst via the carboxyl anchors which strongly bind to the Bi atoms, substantially facilitating the interfacial electron transfer kinetics and thereby the photocatalysis.

         <title>Bypassing Ammonia: From N2 to Nitrogen Heterocycles without N1 Intermediates or Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterocyclic species are prepared from diboradiazene compounds, thus completing two&#8208;step routes to complex N&#8208;heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.







Abstract
Diboradiazene compounds, derived in one step from the boron&#8208;mediated reduction of dinitrogen (N2), were treated separately with sulfur and acetic anhydride, providing heterocyclic compounds that are BN isosteres of thiophene and 1,3&#8208;oxazole, respectively. These simple reactions represent the final steps in two&#8208;step routes to complex heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.

     alt="Bypassing Ammonia: From N2 to Nitrogen Heterocycles without N1 Intermediates or Transition Metals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new heterocyclic species are prepared from diboradiazene compounds, thus completing two-step routes to complex N-heterocycles from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diboradiazene compounds, derived in one step from the boron-mediated reduction of dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), were treated separately with sulfur and acetic anhydride, providing heterocyclic compounds that are BN isosteres of thiophene and 1,3-oxazole, respectively. These simple reactions represent the final steps in two-step routes to complex heterocycles from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Metabolic Glycosylation Reporters Enable Detection of Protein O&#8722;GlcNAcylation in Living Cells without S&#8208;Glyco Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Norbornene&#8208;modified glycosyl phosphates with suitable protecting groups enable labeling of O&#8722;GlcNAcylated proteins by metabolic glycoengineering without artificial modification of cysteine residues. A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is used to introduce a fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) label at O&#8722;GlcNAc sites allowing the imaging of protein&#8208;specific O&#8722;GlcNAcylation within living cells.







Abstract
Protein O&#8722;GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non&#8208;specific protein labeling termed S&#8208;glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene&#8208;modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O&#8722;GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S&#8208;glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioethyl&#8208;protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein&#8208;specific detection of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein&#8208;specific imaging of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economical and efficient electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrogenation is described. The reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. Notably, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides can be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation of alkene and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection.







Abstract
Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large&#8208;scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a NiII/0 catalytic cycle and the pre&#8208;coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.

         <title>Heterodyne&#8208;Detected Sum&#8208;Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Aqueous Molecular Structure at the Suspended Graphene/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using surface&#8208;specific HD&#8208;SFG vibrational spectroscopy, we examine water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1&#8211;2&#8197;water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O&#8722;H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;H group.







Abstract
Graphene, a transparent two&#8208;dimensional conductive material, has brought extensive new perspectives and prospects to various aqueous technological systems, such as desalination membranes, chemical sensors, energy storage, and energy conversion devices. Yet, the molecular&#8208;level details of graphene in contact with aqueous electrolytes, such as water orientation and hydrogen bond structure, remain elusive or controversial. Here, we employ surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) vibrational spectroscopy to re&#8208;examine the water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface. We compare the response from the air/graphene/water system to that from the air/water interface. Our results indicate that the 
 spectrum recorded from the air/graphene/water system arises from the topmost 1&#8211;2&#8197;water layers in contact with the graphene, with the graphene itself not generating a significant SFG response. Compared to the air/water interface response, the presence of monolayer graphene weakly affects the interfacial water. Graphene weakly affects the dangling O&#8722;H group, lowering its frequency through its interaction with the graphene sheet, and has a very small effect on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;H group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. Our work provides molecular insight into the interfacial structure at a suspended graphene/water interface, relevant to various technological applications of graphene.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Switchable Peroxidase/Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of Carbon Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) are synthesized using polyaniline as a precursor. O/N&#8208;CQDs possess photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity that can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity dynamically. Using such an artificial &#8220;light switch&#8221;, it is feasible to autonomously manipulate the ROS level that is adaptive to the development of diseases, providing an intelligent therapeutic strategy for precise medicine.







Abstract
Nanozymes possess multi&#8208;enzyme activities over the natural enzymes, which produce multi&#8208;pathway synergistic effects for varies of biomedical applications. Unfortunately, their multi&#8208;enzyme activities are in fighting, significantly reducing the synergistic effects. Dynamic regulation of their multi&#8208;enzyme activities is the bottleneck for intelligent therapies. Herein, we construct a novel oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer) activity. Interestingly, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity can be reversibly converted to catalase&#8208;like (ROS scavenger) activity under visible light irradiation. It is found that both the peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity. The mechanism of switchable enzyme activities is attributed to the polarization of quinoid nitrogen in polyaniline (PANI) precursor retained on O/N&#8208;CQDs under visible light, which consumes the ROS to produce O2 and H2O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we are able to non&#8208;intrusively up and down regulate the ROS level in cells successfully by simply switching off and on the light respectively, potentially facilitating the precise medicine based on the development of the disease. Indeed, the photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs opens a non&#8208;invasive strategy for better manipulations of the multi&#8208;activity of nanozymes, promising their wider and more intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) can enhance dipole moment and induce more positive surface electrostatic potential, contributing to the compact and diverse molecular stacking, thus promoting exciton delocalization for efficient charge generation. Besides, AHS suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination loss and enabling PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 to yield the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V.







Abstract
High open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem devices and indoor photovoltaics. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide band gap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.232&#8197;V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02&#8201;%, Voc=1.197&#8197;V). Notably, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and Voc, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Cyclobutenones: Total Synthesis of gem&#8208;Dimethylcyclobutane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential enantioselective reduction/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling reaction of cyclobutenones furnished an array of chiral trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones. The developed strategy was applied in the syntheses of several gem&#8208;dimethylcyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products, including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8722;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8722;C, (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8722;)&#8208;raikovenal.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes with a gem&#8208;dimethyl group are common motifs in natural products. However, strategies for constructing enantioenriched gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutanes are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enantioselective approach to synthesize a broad group of chiral 2,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones through sequential 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling of readily available cyclobutenones. The intermediate 2&#8208;bromocyclobutanone provides a valuable synthetic handle for further coupling transformations. In addition, this strategy was successfully utilized to synthesize gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products, including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8722;)&#8208;raikovenal, (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8722;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8722;C.

         <title>Responsive Anionophores with AND Logic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform for accessing stimuli&#8208;responsive anionophores, triggered by multiple stimuli of biological relevance including light, redox, and an esterase, is reported, and accessed via post&#8208;synthetic modification of a dynamic hydrogen bonding anionophore. By utilizing two different cages, a responsive anionophore with AND logic activation, requiring two different stimuli, was achieved.







Abstract
Artificial ion transport systems have emerged as an important class of compounds that promise applications in chemotherapeutics as anticancer agents or to treat channelopathies. Stimulus&#8208;responsive systems that offer spatiotemporally controlled activity for targeted applications remain rare. Here we utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4,6&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;isophthalamide core to generate a modular platform enabling access to stimuli&#8208;responsive ion transporters that can be activated in response to a wide variety of external stimuli, including light, redox, and enzymes, with excellent OFF&#8208;ON activation profiles. Alkylation of the two free hydroxyl groups with stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties locks the amide bonds through intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hence makes them unavailable for anion binding and transport. Triggering using a particular stimulus to cleave both cages reverses the hydrogen bonding arrangement, to generate a highly preorganized anion binding cavity for efficient transmembrane transport. Integration of two cages that are responsive to orthogonal stimuli enables multi&#8208;stimuli activation, where both stimuli are required to trigger transport in an AND logic process. Importantly, the strategy provides a facile method to post&#8208;functionalize the highly active transporter core with a variety of stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties for targeted activation with multiple triggers.

         <title>Acoustic Levitation Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;Density Spherical Nucleic Acid Architectures for Specific SERS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an acoustic levitation reactor for universal, green, and container&#8208;free synthesis of SNAs with ultra&#8208;high DNA density. In addition to the dehydration effect, we reveal for the first time that ultra&#8208;high density DNA grafting derived from acoustic waves reconfigures the ligands on the colloidal surface. Such architectures enable the in situ untargeted SERS tracking of cell events and targeted biomarker diagnosis, facilitated by the DNA shell's ability to construct a 3D SERS hotspot matrix with tunable and controllable nanogaps.







Abstract
Controllably regulating the electrostatic bilayer of nanogold colloids is a significant premise for synthesizing spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and building ordered plasmonic architectures. We develop a facile acoustic levitation reactor to universally synthesize SNAs with an ultra&#8208;high density of DNA strands, which is even higher than those of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Results reveal a new mechanism of DNA grafting via acoustic wave that can reconfigure the ligands on colloidal surfaces. The acoustic levitation reactor enables substrate&#8208;free three&#8208;dimentional (3D) spatial assembly of SNAs with controllable interparticle nanogaps through regulating DNA lengths. This kind of architecture may overcome the plasmonic enhancement limits by blocking electron tunneling and breaking electrostatic shielding in dried aggregations. Finite element simulations support the architecture with 3D spatial plasmonic hotspot matrix, and its ultrahigh surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) capability is evidenced by in situ untargeted tracking of biomolecular events during photothermal stimulation (PTS)&#8208;induced cell death process. For biomarker diagnosis, the conjugation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer onto SNAs enables in situ targeted tracking of ATP during PTS&#8208;induced cell death process. Particularly, the CD71 receptor and integrin &#945;3&#946;1 protein on PL45&#8197;cell membrance could be well distinguished by label&#8208;free SERS fingerprints when using specific XQ&#8208;2d and DML&#8208;7 aptamers, respectively, to synthesize SNA architectures. Our current acoustic levitation reactor offers a new method for synthesizing SNAs and enables both targeted and untargeted SERS analysis for tracking molecular events in living systems. It promises great potentials in biochemical synthesis and sensing in future.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Vigorous Iodic Species Triggered by Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;nitrate (I2&#8722;LiNO3)&#8208;containing ether&#8208;based electrolyte has been applied to Li&#8722;S battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode. The I&#8722;/HI&#8208;induced polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is inhibited in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate can chemically oxidize I&#8722;/HI to I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722;, which play a crucial role to accelerate cathode conversion reaction and rejuvenate anode dead Li simultaneously. With the modified electrolyte, Li&#8722;S battery demonstrates long calendar life, high energy density and power efficiency.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode is a promising alternative to Li&#8208;ion systems. However, the sluggish charge transfer of cathode and accumulation of inactive Li on anode remain persistent challenges. An advanced electrolyte additive with function towards both cathode and anode holds great promise to address these issues. Herein, we present a new strategy to boost sulfur activity and rejuvenate dead Li simultaneously. In the polar electrolyte containing I2&#8722;LiNO3 additives, I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are triggered significantly by the reaction between NO3&#8722; and I&#8722; ions.

     alt="Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Vigorous Iodic Species Triggered by Nitrate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iodine-nitrate (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-containing ether-based electrolyte has been applied to Li&#8722;S battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode. The I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/HI-induced polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane is inhibited in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate can chemically oxidize I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/HI to I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which play a crucial role to accelerate cathode conversion reaction and rejuvenate anode dead Li simultaneously. With the modified electrolyte, Li&#8722;S battery demonstrates long calendar life, high energy density and power efficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode is a promising alternative to Li-ion systems. However, the sluggish charge transfer of cathode and accumulation of inactive Li on anode remain persistent challenges. An advanced electrolyte additive with function towards both cathode and anode holds great promise to address these issues. Herein, we present a new strategy to boost sulfur activity and rejuvenate dead Li simultaneously. In the polar electrolyte containing I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additives, I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are triggered significantly by the reaction between NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are reactive to insulated Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S product of cathode and inactive Li on anode, thus accelerating the conversion reaction of sulfur and recovering Li sources back to battery cycling.

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Toughening of Interpenetrated Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive networks are synthesized with distinct polymer arrangements of the polymers. The structure of the network impacts the materials properties in both the resting state, and in the presence of carbodiimide fuels which transiently form anhydride crosslinks. Interpenetrated materials in the fueled state have superior fracture and compressive properties.







Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated that temporary crosslinks in polymer networks generated by chemical &#8220;fuels&#8221; afford materials with large, transient changes in their mechanical properties. This can be accomplished in carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polymer hydrogels using carbodiimides, which generate anhydride crosslinks with lifetimes on the order of minutes to hours. Here, the impact of the polymer network architecture on the mechanical properties of transiently crosslinked materials was explored. Single networks (SNs) were compared to interpenetrated networks (IPNs). Notably, semi&#8208;IPN precursors that give IPNs on treatment with carbodiimide give much higher fracture energies (i.e., resistance to fracture) and superior resistance to compressive strain compared to other network architectures. A precursor semi&#8208;IPN material featuring acrylic acid in only the free polymer chains yields, on treatment with carbodiimide, an IPN with a fracture energy of 2400&#8197;J/m2, a fourfold increase compared to an analogous semi&#8208;IPN precursor that yields a SN. This resistance to fracture enables the formation of macroscopic complex cut patterns, even at high strain, underscoring the pivotal role of polymer architecture in mechanical performance.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Oriented Crystal Growth toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Zinc Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar nucleation and oriented growth of (002) crystal plane is visualized by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy on an Ag&#8208;modified surface. The high solubility of Ag in Zn metal enables formation of solid solution buffer layer with greatly decreased nucleation barrier. The preferential orientation of deposition exhibits dendrite&#8208;free morphology with suppressed side reactions, meriting the high Zn utilization and improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Zn deposition with a surface&#8208;preferred (002) crystal plane has attracted extensive attention due to its inhibited dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the nucleation and growth of the Zn(002) crystal plane are closely related to the interfacial properties. Herein, oriented growth of Zn(002) crystal plane is realized on Ag&#8208;modified surface that is directly visualized by in situ atomic force microscopy. A solid solution HCP&#8208;Zn (~1.10&#8197;at.&#8201;% solubility of Ag, 30&#8201;&#176;C) is formed on the Ag coated Zn foil (Zn@Ag) and possesses the same crystal structure as Zn to reduce its nucleation barrier caused by their lattice mismatch. It merits oriented Zn deposition and corrosion&#8208;resistant surface, and presents long cycling stability in symmetric cells and full cells coupled with V2O5 cathode. This work provides insights into interfacial regulation of Zn anodes for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Experimental Evidence for Non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;Contact J Coupling Across Chalcogen Bonds in Ionic Salt Cocrystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental evidence for non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;contact contributions to J couplings across chalcogen bonds is presented for a pair of newly discovered ionic cocrystal polymorphs. Large and anisotropic J(125Te, 79/81Br) coupling and 79/81Br quadrupolar coupling tensor magnitudes measured via 125Te and 79/81Br solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provide new experimental insight into the nature of the chalcogen bond.







Abstract
A pair of novel polymorphic ionic cocrystals of 3,4&#8208;dicyanotelluradiazole and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are synthesized and are characterized by single&#8208;crystal XRD. Strong and directional non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bonds (ChB) between Te and Br are analyzed via solid&#8208;state NMR to reveal large and anisotropic J(125Te,79/81Br) coupling tensors, providing unequivocal evidence for non&#8208;Fermi contact contributions across ChBs. Along with large 79/81Br quadrupolar couplings for the Br&#8722; anions, these data provide new tools to characterize chalcogen bonds and to differentiate between ChB polymorphs.

         <title>Imidazole&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Hydroxide Enabling the Li+ Desolvation/Diffusion Reaction and Flame Retardant Catalytic Dynamics for Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have found extensive applications due to their high energy density and low self&#8208;discharge rates, spanning from compact consumer electronics to large&#8208;scale energy storage facilities. Despite their widespread use, challenges such as inherent capacity degradation and the potential for thermal runaway hinder sustainable development. In this study, we introduce a unique approach to synthesize anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, specifically imidazole&#8208;intercalated cobalt hydroxide. This innovative material significantly enhances the Li+ desolvation/diffusion reaction and flame&#8208;retardant dynamics through complexing and catalytic synergetic effects. The lithium&#8208;ion batteries incorporating these materials demonstrate exceptional performance, boasting an impressive capacity retention of 997.91 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles. This achievement can be attributed to the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interface engineering, effectively mitigating anode degradation and minimizing electrolyte consumption. Experimental and theoretical calculations validate these improvements. Importantly, imidazole intercalated Co(OH)2 (MI&#8208; Co(OH)2) exhibits a remarkable catalytic effect on electrolyte carbonization and the conversion of CO to CO2. This dual action suppresses smoke and reduces toxicity significantly. The presented work introduces a novel approach to realizing high&#8208;performance and safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing key challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Formation of Platinum&#8208;Carbon Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction in the chemical industry. By combining operando transmission electron microscopy with density functional theory analysis, we show that the intercalation and ordering of carbon on Pt interstitials to form Pt&#8208;C solid solutions is relevant for increasing propylene production. More specifically, we found that at the point of enhanced propylene formation, the structure of platinum nanoparticles is transformed into a transient caesium chloride&#8208;type Pt&#8208;C polymorph. At more elevated temperatures, the zincblende and rock salt polymorphs seemingly coexist. When propylene production was highest, multiple crystal structures consisting of Pt and carbon were occasionally found to coexist in one individual nanoparticle, distorting the Pt lattice. Catalyst coking was detected at all stages of the reaction, but did initially not affect all particles. These findings could lead to the development of novel synthesis strategies towards tailoring highly efficient PDH catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ/Operando Synchrotron Analytical Techniques for CO2/CO Reduction Reaction: From Atomic Scales to Mesoscales</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhancing the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro&#8208;environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron analytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fourth&#8208;generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron analytical techniques is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Polymerized Spiro&#8208;Type Interfacial Molecule toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;polymerized spiro&#8208;type interfacial molecule, v&#8208;spiro is designed and exhibit superior intermolecular interactions and intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. The resulting polymeric protective layer successfully mitigated moisture degradation and ion migration in perovskite film. Poly&#8208;v&#8208;spiro&#8208;treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 24.54&#8201;% with voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, accompanied by improved stability.







Abstract
In the pursuit of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, spiro&#8208;OMeTAD has demonstrated recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), however, the stability issue remains one of the bottlenecks constraining its commercial development. In this study, we successfully synthesize a novel self&#8208;polymerized spiro&#8208;type interfacial molecule, termed v&#8208;spiro. The linearly arranged molecule exhibits stronger intermolecular interactions and higher intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Importantly, the vinyl groups in v&#8208;spiro enable in situ polymerization, forming a polymeric protective layer on the perovskite film surface, which proves highly effective in suppressing moisture degradation and ion migration. Utilizing these advantages, poly&#8208;v&#8208;spiro&#8208;based device achieves an outstanding efficiency of 24.54&#8201;%, with an enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and a fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, owing to the reduced defect density, energy level alignment and efficient interfacial hole extraction. Furthermore, the operational stability of unencapsulated devices is significantly enhanced, maintaining initial efficiencies above 90&#8201;% even after 2000&#8197;hours under approximately 60&#8201;% humidity or 1250&#8197;hours under continuous AM&#8197;1.5G sunlight exposure. This work presents a comprehensive approach to achieving both high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in PSCs through innovative interfacial design.

         <title>A Vitrimer Acts as a Compatibilizer for Polyethylene and Polypropylene Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer can compatibilize a polymer blend. By adding a relatively small amount of a vitrimer made of siloxane&#8208;crosslinked high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), we successfully compatibilized unmodified HDPE and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend exhibited enhanced elongation at break (120&#8201;%) and smaller iPP domain sizes (0.4&#8197;&#956;m) compared to the control blend (22&#8201;% elongation at break, 0.9&#8197;&#956;m iPP droplet size).







Abstract
Polymer compatibilization plays a critical role in achieving polymer blends with favorable mechanical properties and enabling efficient recycling of mixed plastic wastes. Nonetheless, traditional compatibilization methods often require tailored designs based on the specific chemical compositions of the blends. In this study, we propose a new approach for compatibilizing polymer blends using a dynamically crosslinked polymer network, known as vitrimers. By adding a relatively small amount (1&#8211;5&#8197;w/w%) of a vitrimer made of siloxane&#8208;crosslinked high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), we successfully compatibilized unmodified HDPE and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend exhibited enhanced elongation at break (120&#8201;%) and smaller iPP domain sizes (0.4&#8197;&#956;m) compared to the control blend (22&#8201;% elongation at break, 0.9&#8197;&#956;m iPP droplet size). Moreover, the vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend showed significantly improved microphase stability during annealing at 180&#8201;&#176;C. This straightforward method shows promise for applications across various polymer blend systems.

Heterogeneous biocatalysis is highly relevant in biotechnology as it offers several benefits and practical uses. To leverage the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysts, the establishment of well&#8208;crafted protocols, and a deeper comprehension of enzyme immobilization on solid substrates are essential. These endeavors seek to optimize immobilized biocatalysts, ensuring maximal enzyme performance within confined spaces. For this aim, multidimensional characterization of heterogeneous biocatalysts is required. In this context, spectroscopic and microscopic methodologies conducted at different space and temporal scales can inform about the intraparticle enzyme kinetics, the enzyme spatial distribution, and the mass transport issues. In this Minireview, we identify enzyme immobilization, enzyme catalysis, and enzyme inactivation as the three main processes for which advanced characterization tools unveil fundamental information. Recent advances in operando characterization of immobilized enzymes at the single&#8208;particle (SP) and single&#8208;molecule (SM) levels inform about their functional properties, unlocking the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysis toward biotechnological applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Multilevel Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique structural and electronic properties of two one&#8208;dimensional (1D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely COF&#8208;MDA and COF&#8208;ODA, were rationally designed to assess their capabilities in multilevel memory devices. This study further explored the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors in realizing energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices, and also showcased their potential for neuromorphic applications for the first time.







Abstract
Memristors are essential components of neuromorphic systems that mimic the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neurons. In this study, a novel approach employing one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF) films was explored to enhance the performance of memristors. The unique structural and electronic properties of two 1D COF films (COF&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA) and COF&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxydianiline (ODA)) offer advantages for multilevel resistive switching, which is a key feature in neuromorphic computing applications. By further introducing a TiO2 layer on the COF&#8208;ODA film, a built&#8208;in electric field between the COF&#8208;TiO2 interfaces could be generated, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing COFs as a platform for constructing memristors with tunable resistive states. The 1D nanochannels of these COF structures contributed to the efficient modulation of electrical conductance, enabling precise control over synaptic weights in neuromorphic circuits. This study also investigated the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors to achieve energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices.

         <title>Chiral Canoe&#8208;Like Pd0 or Pt0 Alloyed Copper Alkynyl Nanoclusters Display Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six racemic copper nanoclusters (NCs) alloyed with Pd0 or Pt0 were synthesized, showing a distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage. Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; can replace one or two alkynyl ligands through ligand exchange. All the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with emission peaks (705&#8211;755&#8197;nm), lifetimes (6.630&#8211;9.662&#8197;&#956;s), and absolute quantum yields (1.75&#8201;%&#8211;2.52&#8201;%) in their crystalline state.







Abstract
Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) has emerged as a widely explored and versatile strategy for tailoring tunable properties, facilitating in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level investigations of structure&#8208;property correlations. In this study, we have successfully synthesized six atomically precise copper NCs alloyed with Group 10 metals (Pd or Pt). Notably, the Pd0 or Pt0 atom situated at the center of the distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage, coordinated with twelve Cu+ and two tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; ligands. Moreover, ligand exchange strategies demonstrated the potential for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; to replace one or two alkynyl ligands positioned at the top or side of the NCs. The chirality exhibited by these racemic NCs is primarily attributed to the involvement of halogens and a chiral (Pd/Pt)@Cu18 skeleton. Furthermore, all the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence, characterized by emission peaks at 705&#8211;755&#8197;nm, lifetimes ranging from 6.630 to 9.662&#8197;&#956;s, and absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 1.75&#8201;%&#8211;2.52&#8201;% in their crystalline state. The experimental optical properties of these NCs are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of theoretical calculations. These alloy NCs not only offer valuable insights into the synthesis of Pd0/Pt0&#8208;Cu alloy NCs, but also bridge the gap in understanding the structure&#8208;luminescence relationships of Pd0/Pt0&#8208;Cu molecules.

         <title>Synthetic Peptides with Genetic&#8208;Codon&#8208;Tailored Affinity for Assembling Tetraspanin CD81 at Cell Interfaces and Inhibiting Cancer Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first peptidyl ligand targeting the intrinsically disordered region of tetraspanin CD81 has been identified. By forming steric complementarity with CD81, the peptide enables in situ tracking of the dynamic distribution of CD81 at cell&#8208;contact interfaces. Further blockage of cell migration highlights the key role of the target motif of CD81 in cell communication, which presents the peptide as a functional inhibitor against cancer growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Probing biomolecular interactions at cellular interfaces is crucial for understanding and interfering with life processes. Although affinity binders with site specificity for membrane proteins are unparalleled molecular tools, a high demand remains for novel multi&#8208;functional ligands. In this study, a synthetic peptide (APQQ) with tight and specific binding to the untargeted extracellular loop of CD81 evolved from a genetically encoded peptide pool. With tailored affinity, APQQ flexibly accesses, site&#8208;specifically binds, and forms a complex with CD81, enabling in&#8208;situ tracking of the dynamics and activity of this protein in living cells, which has rarely been explored because of the lack of ligands. Furthermore, APQQ triggers the relocalization of CD81 from diffuse to densely clustered at cell junctions and modulates the interplay of membrane proteins at cellular interfaces. Motivated by these, efficient suppression of cancer cell migration, and inhibition of breast cancer metastasis were achieved in vivo.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Ethylene Epoxidation by Single Atom Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse single atom Ru&#8208;doped KIr4O8 nanowire catalyst, with electronic structures of adjacent Ir sites being modulated by single Ru atoms, is developed for electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO). It achieves an EO partial current density up to 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of ethylene oxide (EO) using ethylene and water under ambient conditions presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative to existing industrial production process. Yet, the electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation route is currently hindered by largely insufficient activity, EO selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report a single atom Ru&#8208;doped hollandite structure KIr4O8 (KIrRuO) nanowire catalyst for efficient EO production via a chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene epoxidation process. The KIrRuO catalyst exhibits an EO partial current density up to 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0&#8201;%. The impressive electrocatalytic performance towards ethylene epoxidation is ascribed to the modulation of electronic structures of adjacent Ir sites by single Ru atoms, which stabilizes the *CH2CH2OH intermediate and facilitates the formation of active Cl2 species during the generation of 2&#8208;chloroethanol, the precursor of EO. This work provides a single atom modulation strategy for improving the reactivity of adjacent metal sites in heterogeneous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Exploring Pyroelectricity, Thermal and Photochemical Switching in a Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Crystal by In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials based on known molecular photoswitches show great potential for the rational design of new pyro&#8208; and ferroelectric photoswitches. This article shows how in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction using thermal, photochemical and electrical stimuli can explore structure&#8211;property relationships in the novel pyroelectric (FA)[NaFe(CN)6(NO]).H2O, enabling a deeper understanding of its complex energy landscape via structural&#8208;dynamics calculations.







Abstract
The switching behavior of the novel hybrid material (FA)Na[Fe(CN)5(NO)].H2O (1) in response to temperature (T), light irradiation and electric field (E) is studied using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Crystals of 1 display piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, second and third harmonic generation. XRD shows that the FA+ are disordered at room&#8208;temperature, but stepwise cooling from 273&#8211;100&#8197;K induces gradual ordering, while cooling under an applied field (E=+40&#8197;kVcm&#8722;1) induces a sudden phase change at 140&#8197;K. Structural&#8208;dynamics calculations suggest the field pushes the system into a region of the structural potential&#8208;energy surface that is otherwise inaccessible, demonstrating that application of T and E offers an effective route to manipulating the crystal chemistry of these materials. Photocrystallography also reveals photoinduced linkage isomerism, which coexists with but is not correlated to other switching behaviors. These experiments highlight a new approach to in situ studies of hybrid materials, providing insight into the structure&#8211;property relationships that underpin their functionality.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Modification and Degradation of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented within is a selective electrochemical decarboxylative route to synthesize olefin&#8208;acrylate copolymers by post&#8208;polymerization modification, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. In addition, the electrochemical decarboxylative methodology provides a targeted approach to the degradation of polymethacrylates. This approach provides an attractive route to the modification and chemical recyclability of polymers.







Abstract
We demonstrate that electrochemical&#8208;induced decarboxylation enables reliable post&#8208;polymerization modification and degradation of polymers. Polymers containing N&#8208;(acryloxy)phthalimides were subjected to electrochemical decarboxylation under mild conditions, which led to the formation of transient alkyl radicals. By installing these redox&#8208;active units, we systematically modified the pendent groups and chain ends of polyacrylates. This approach enabled the production of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) and poly(propylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) copolymers, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. Spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques reveal these transformations are near&#8208;quantitative on several polymer systems. Electrochemical decarboxylation also enables the degradation of all&#8208;methacrylate poly(N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide&#8208;co&#8208;methyl methacrylate) copolymers with a degradation efficiency of &gt;95&#8201;%. Chain cleavage is achieved through the decarboxylation of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission of the backbone radical. Electrochemistry is thus shown to be a powerful tool in selective polymer transformations and controlled macromolecular degradation.

         <title>An Isolable One&#8208;Coordinate Lead(I) Radical with Strong g&#8208;Factor Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first lead&#8208;centered radical containing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb atom was isolated and fully characterized. It possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and hence substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, as manifested by hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy amongst main group radicals.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;based radicals in the oxidation state of +1 are elusive species and are highly challenging to isolate in the condensed phase. In this study, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first isolable free plumbylyne radical 2 bearing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb(I) atom. It reacts with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to afford a two&#8208;coordinate NHC&#8208;ligated Pb(I) radical 3. 2 and 3 represent the first isolable Pb(I)&#8208;based radicals. Theoretical calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that the unpaired electron mainly resides at the Pb 6p orbital in both radicals. Owing to the unique one&#8208;coordinate nature of the Pb atom in 2, it possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, and exhibits hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy (gx,y,z=1.496, 1.166, 0.683) amongst main group radicals. Preliminary investigations into the reactivity of 2 unveiled its Pb&#8208;centered radical nature, and plumbylenes were isolated as products.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Tailoring Molecular Structures of Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DTTP&#8208;ThSO is designed by dual&#8208;strategy method combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering, which can construct six&#8208;membered ring through S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent conformation lock. DTTP&#8208;ThSO exhibits high hole mobility, good energy level matching, and strong defect passivation ability. The dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs achieve an impressive PCE of 23.3&#8201;% with an FF of 82.3&#8201;%, among the highest performance n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs) are ideal materials for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most current design strategies for tailoring the molecular structures of HTMs are limited to single strategy. Herein, four HTMs based on dithienothiophenepyrrole (DTTP) core are devised through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering. DTTP&#8208;ThSO with ester alkyl chain that can form six&#8208;membered ring by the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent conformation lock with thiophene in the backbone shows good planarity, high&#8208;quality film, matching energy level and high hole mobility, as well as strong defect passivation ability. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3&#8201;% with a nice long&#8208;term stability is achieved by dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs, representing one of the highest values for un&#8208;doped organic HTMs based PSCs. Especially, the fill factor (FF) of 82.3&#8201;% is the highest value for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs to date. Moreover, DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based devices have achieved an excellent PCE of 20.9&#8201;% in large&#8208;area (1.01&#8197;cm2) devices. This work clearly elucidates the structure&#8208;performance relationships of HTMs and offers a practical dual&#8208;strategy approach to designing dopant&#8208;free HTMs for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Cancer Cell&#8208;Selective PD&#8208;L1 Inhibition via a DNA Safety Catch to Enhance Immunotherapy Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, a duplex DNA strand, was assembled on PD&#8722;L1 to control its accessibility by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reagent. ICB reagent was a retractable DNA nanostring (DNS), whose contraction drove PD&#8722;L1 clustering and corresponding degradation. 4T1&#8197;cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met controlled ICB reagent binding and achieved cancer cell selective PD&#8722;L1 inhibition. This strategy enhanced immunotherapeutic specificity.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint protein blockade (ICB) has emerged as a powerful immunotherapy approach, but suppressing immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) for noncancerous cells and normal tissues remains challenging. Activatable ICB has been developed with tumor microenvironment highly&#8208;expressed molecules as stimuli, but they still lack precision and efficiency considering the diffusion of stimuli molecules in whole tumor tissue. Here we assemble PD&#8722;L1 with a duplex DNA strand, termed as &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, to regulate its accessibility for ICB. The safety catch remains at &#8220;on&#8221; status for noncancerous cells to prevent ICB binding to PD&#8722;L1. Cancer cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met acts as a trigger protein to react with safety catch, which selectively exposes its hybridization region for ICB reagent. The ICB reagent is a retractable DNA nanostring with repeating hairpin&#8208;structural units, whose contraction drives PD&#8722;L1 clustering with endocytosis&#8208;guided degradation. The safety catch, even remained at &#8220;safety on&#8221; status, is removed from the cell membrane via a DNA strand displacement reaction to minimize its influence on noncancerous cells. This strategy demonstrates selective and potent immunotherapeutic capabilities only against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and shows effective suppression of irAEs in normal tissues, therefore would become a promising approach for precise immunotherapy in mice.

&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, a duplex DNA strand, was assembled on PD&#8722;L1 to control its accessibility by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reagent. ICB reagent was a retractable DNA nanostring (DNS), whose contraction drove PD&#8722;L1 clustering and corresponding degradation. 4T1&#8197;cell membrane protein c-Met controlled ICB reagent binding and achieved cancer cell selective PD&#8722;L1 inhibition. This strategy enhanced immunotherapeutic specificity.

         <title>Alkoxycarbonyl Groups in Metalloesters Showing Oxocarbenium&#8208;like Structure and Alkylating Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of Co/Ni bimetallic metalloesters bearing the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups are synthesized and characterized. As triggered by the long O&#8722;Calkyl bonds (1.522(11)~1.607(15)&#8197;&#197;), the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups toward a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism was examined at ambient conditions.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;documented acylating reactivity, the alkylating reactivity of the alkoxycarbonyl group, as signified by its oxocarbenium&#8208;like resonance structure, remains almost unexplored. Herein, the first series of Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters exhibiting the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups were synthesized and characterized. In these deformed alkoxycarbonyl groups, the Ccarbonyl&#8722;Oalkoxyl bonds were contracted to 1.177(11)~1.191(9)&#8197;&#197; with the elongations of the Ccarbonyl=Ocarbonyl bonds to 1.368(13)~1.441(9)&#8197;&#197;. Meanwhile, the O&#8722;Calkyl bonds were also elongated to 1.522(11) ~1.607(15)&#8197;&#197;, and were by far the longest O&#8722;Calkyl bonds reported for alkoxycarbonyl groups. As triggered by the long O&#8722;Calkyl distances, the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like methoxycarbonyl group towards a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism at ambient conditions was examined. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;etherifications of alcohols mediated by the Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters were investigated. The yields followed the trend ethanol&#8811;n&#8208;propanol&#8811;n&#8208;butanol &#8776;n&#8208;pentanol, that closely related to the structure features of the alkoxycarbonyl groups in corresponding metalloesters: while the ethoxycarbonyl group showed the reactive oxocarbenium&#8208;like framework, the n&#8208;propoxycarbonyl group displayed the dioxocarbenium&#8208;like skeleton with a shorter O&#8722;Calkyl bond; In comparison, the classical frameworks with unactivated alkyl moieties were observed for n&#8208;butoxycarbonyl and n&#8208;pentoxycarbonyl groups.

         <title>Activating and Stabilizing a Reversible four Electron Redox Reaction of I&#8722;/I+ for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient inter&#8208;halogen activation strategy together with an interlayer confinement design, which successfully triggers and stabilizes a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction from I&#8722; to I+ for Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries. As a result, the specific capacity, output voltage and cycling performance of zinc&#8208;iodide battery are greatly improved.







Abstract
Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8722; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH nanoflowers serve as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8722;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000&#8197;cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Intrinsic RNA Targeting Triggers Indiscriminate DNase Activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the intrinsic RNA&#8208;activated cleavage activity of Cas12a and developed the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;Sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;free nucleic acid testing with improved specificity. We validated its clinical utility by detecting both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples, achieving comparable performance with the PCR/RT&#8208;PCR method.







Abstract
The CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system has emerged as a powerful tool for next&#8208;generation nucleic acid&#8208;based molecular diagnostics. However, it has long been believed to be effective only on DNA targets. Here, we investigate the intrinsic RNA&#8208;enabled trans&#8208;cleavage activity of AsCas12a and LbCas12a and discover that they can be directly activated by full&#8208;size RNA targets, although LbCas12a exhibits weaker trans&#8208;cleavage activity than AsCas12a on both single&#8208;stranded DNA and RNA substrates. Remarkably, we find that the RNA&#8208;activated Cas12a possesses higher specificity in recognizing mutated target sequences compared to DNA activation. Based on these findings, we develop the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;Sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for nucleic acid testing. We incorporate a T7 transcription step into this assay, thereby eliminating the requirement for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target. Additionally, we successfully detect multiple PAM&#8208;less targets in HIV clinical samples that are undetectable by the conventional Cas12a assay based on double&#8208;stranded DNA activation, demonstrating unrestricted target selection with the UNIVERSE assay. We further validate the clinical utility of the UNIVERSE assay by testing both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples. We envision that the intrinsic RNA targeting capability may bring a paradigm shift in Cas12a&#8208;based nucleic acid detection and further enhance the understanding of CRISPR&#8208;Cas biochemistry.

Deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8722;P5s) show unprecedent binding towards perfluoroalkyl acids with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 ratio and K&#8805;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment shows that DAF&#8722;P5s immobilized on silica can purify perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) polluted water down to 13&#8197;ng/L.







Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a rapidly increasing global problem as their widespread use and high stability lead worldwide to water contamination, with significant detrimental health effects.[1] Supramolecular chemistry has been invoked to develop materials geared towards the specific capture of PFAS from water,[2] to reduce the concentration below advisory safety limits (e.g., 70&#8197;ng/L for the sum of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA). Scale&#8208;up and use in natural waters with high PFAS concentrations has hitherto posed a problem. Here we report a new type of host&#8211;guest interaction between deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8722;P5s) and perfluoroalkyl acids. DAF&#8722;P5 complexes show an unprecedented 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 stoichiometry, as confirmed by isothermal calorimetry and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies, and high binding constants (up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1) to various polyfluoroalkyl acids. In addition, non&#8208;fluorinated acids do not hamper this process significantly. Immobilization of DAF&#8722;P5s allows a simple single&#8208;time filtration of PFAS&#8208;contaminated water to reduce the PFOS/PFOA concentration 106&#8197;times to 15&#8211;50&#8197;ng/L level. The effective and fast (&lt;5&#8197;min) orthogonal binding to organic molecules without involvement of fluorinated supramolecular hosts, high breakthrough capacity (90&#8197;mg/g), and robust performance (&gt;10&#8197;regeneration cycles without decrease in performance) set a new benchmark in PFAS&#8208;absorbing materials.

         <title>A High&#8208;Yielding Active Template Click Reaction (AT&#8722;CuAAC) for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor to a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine embedded [9]cycloparaphenylene (bipy[9]CPP) has been used to generate mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane molecules in high yield through an active template azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8722;CuAAC) reaction. These [2]rotaxanes then serve as key intermediates to nanohoop[2]catenane structures.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) represent an exciting yet underexplored area of research in the context of carbon nanoscience. Recently, work from our group and others has shown that small carbon nanotube fragments&#8212;[n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related nanohoop macrocycles&#8212;may be integrated into mechanically interlocked architectures by leveraging supramolecular interactions, covalent tethers, or metal&#8208;ion templates. Still, available synthetic methods are typically difficult and low yielding, and general methods that allow for the creation of a wide variety of these structures are limited. Here we report an efficient route to interlocked nanohoop structures via the active template Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8722;CuAAC) reaction. With the appropriate choice of substituents, a macrocyclic precursor to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl embedded [9]CPP (bipy[9]CPP) participates in the AT&#8722;CuAAC reaction to provide [2]rotaxanes in near&#8208;quantitative yield, which can then be converted into the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated catenane structures. Through this approach, two nanohoop[2]catenanes are synthesized which consist of a bipy[9]CPP catenated with either Tz[10]CPP or Tz[12]CPP (where Tz denotes a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety replacing one phenylene ring in the [n]CPP backbone).

         <title>Simultaneous Inside and Outside Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with positively charged disulfide macrocycles has led to a unique material, in which the SWCNTs are decorated from the outside with macrocycles and on the inside contain polyiodide chains. The wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of such SWCNT peapod materials is an important step toward uses that require macroscopic amounts.







Abstract
Functionalizing single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a robust way that does not affect the sp2 carbon framework is a considerable research challenge. Here we describe how triiodide salts of positively charged macrocycles can be used not only to functionalize SWCNTs from the outside, but simultaneously from the inside. We employed disulfide exchange in aqueous solvent to maximize the solvophobic effect and therefore achieve a high degree of macrocycle immobilization. Characterization by Raman spectroscopy, EDX&#8208;STEM and HR&#8208;TEM clearly showed that serendipitously this wet&#8208;chemical functionalization procedure also led to the encapsulation of polyiodide chains inside the nanotubes. The resulting three&#8208;shell composite materials are redox&#8208;active and experience an intriguing interplay of electrostatic, solvophobic and mechanical effects that could be of interest for applications in energy storage.

         <title>Alkyl&#8211;&#960; Functional Molecular Gels: Control of Elastic Modulus and Improvement of Electret Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the development of alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gels (FMGs), in which the addition of a 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator can increase the elastic modulus of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Furthermore, gelation improved the performance of mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices compared to liquid&#8208;based ones.







Abstract
The development of optoelectronically&#8208;active soft materials is drawing attention to the application of soft electronics. A room&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free liquid obtained by modifying a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with flexible yet bulky alkyl chains is a promising functional soft material. Tuning the elastic modulus (G&#8242;) is essential for employing optoelectronically&#8208;active alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids in deformable devices. However, the range of G&#8242; achieved through the molecular design of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids is limited. We report herein a method for controlling G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by gelation. Adding 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator formed the alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gel (FMG) and increased G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Because alkyl&#8211;&#960; FMGs have functional &#960;&#8208;moieties in the gel medium, this new class of gels has a much higher content of &#960;&#8208;moieties of up to 59&#8197;wt&#8201;% compared to conventional &#960;&#8208;gels of only a few wt&#8201;%. More importantly, the gel state has a 23&#8201;% higher charge&#8208;retention capacity than the liquid, providing better performance in deformable mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices. The strategy used in this study is a novel approach for developing next&#8208;generation optoelectronically&#8208;active FMG materials.

         <title>An H2O2 Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off&#8208;grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self&#8208;charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time&#8208;consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)6 battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery to 1.7 V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging rate and the extremely short self&#8208;charging time within 60 seconds. Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self&#8208;charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single&#8208;flow battery of 7.06 Ah to extend the long&#8208;term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self&#8208;charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self&#8208;charging power systems for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.</dc:description>

Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self-charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single-flow battery of 7.06 Ah to extend the long-term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self-charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self-charging power systems for advanced large-scale energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization to Prepare Recylable Micro&#8208;Adjuvants for Dendritic Cell Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, the maturation of DCs is a critical stage. Adjuvants play a pivotal role in the maturation of DCs, with a major concern being to ensure both efficacy and safety. This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of micro&#8208;adjuvants grafted with copolymers of 2&#8208;(methacrylamido) glucopyranose (MAG) and methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC). The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. These micrometer&#8208;sized adjuvants surpass the optimal size range for cellular endocytosis, enabling the retrieval and reuse of them during the ex vivo maturation process, mitigating potential toxicity concerns associated with the endocytosis of non&#8208;metabolized nanoparticles. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation. This effect is influenced by the shape of the particle, as evidenced by the distinct promotion effects of rod&#8208;like and spherical micro&#8208;adjuvants with comparable sizes. Furthermore, the porous structure of the adjuvants enables them to function as cargo&#8208;carrying &#8220;micro&#8208;shuttles&#8221;, releasing antigens upon binding to DCs to facilitate efficient antigen delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced C(sp3)&#8208;H Bicyclopentylation Enabled by an Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Mediated Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoredox electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated radical coupling reaction has gained prominence in the field of organic synthesis, finding widespread application in two&#8208;component coupling reactions. However, EDA complex&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component reactions are not well developed with only a limited number of examples have been reported. Herein, we report a photoinduced and EDA complex&#8208;promoted highly chemoselective three&#8208;component radical arylalkylation of [1.1.1]propellane, which allows the direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8211;H with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;aryl groups under mild conditions. A variety of unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, featuring structurally diversified 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties, were synthesized in a single&#8208;step process. Notably, leveraging the high tension release of [1.1.1]propellane, the highly unstable transient aryl radical undergoes rapid conversion into a relatively stable tertiary alkyl transient radical, and consequently, the competing side&#8208;reaction of two&#8208;component coupling was entirely suppressed. The strategic use of this transient radical conversion approach would be useful for the design of diverse EDA complex&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;component reactions. It is noteworthy that the highly chemoselective late&#8208;stage incorporation of the 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP pharmacophores into peptides was achieved both in liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions. This advancement is anticipated to have significant application potential in the future development of peptide drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Cadmium Sulfide for Photocatalytic Production of Amino Acids from Biomass Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as important ingredients for other nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Here, we report the sustainable production of amino acids from biomass&#8208;derived hydroxy acids with high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation and mild conditions, using atomic ruthenium&#8208;promoted cadmium sulfide (Ru1/CdS). On a metal basis, the optimized Ru1/CdS exhibits a maximal alanine formation rate of 26.0&#160;molAla&#183;gRu&#8209;1&#183;h&#8209;1, which is 1.7 times and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of its nanoparticle counterpart and the conventional thermocatalytic process, respectively. Integrated spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations attribute the high performance of Ru1/CdS to the facilitated charge separation and O&#8208;H bond dissociation of the a&#8208;hydroxy group, here of lactic acid. The operando nuclear magnetic resonance further infers a unique &#8220;double activation&#8221; mechanism of both the CH&#8208;OH and CH3&#8208;CH&#8208;OH structures in lactic acid, which significantly accelerates its photocatalytic amination toward alanine.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Skeletal and Peripheral Editing of Pyrroles with Vinylcarbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal editing of azaarenes through insertion, deletion, or swapping of single atoms has recently gained considerable momentum in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe a practical skeletal editing strategy using vinylcarbenes in&#8208;situ generated from trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones, leading to the first dearomative skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion. Furthermore, depending on the used catalyst and substrate, three types of peripheral editing reactions of pyrroles are also disclosed: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8211;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition. These controllable molecular editing reactions provide a powerful platform for accessing medicinally relevant CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks, such as 2,5&#8208;dihydropyridines, piperidines, azabicyclo[3.3.0]octadienes, and allylated pyrroles from readily available pyrroles. Mechanistic insights from experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the origin of substrate&#8208; or catalyst&#8208;controlled chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Elaborate Modulating Binding Strength of Intermediates via Three&#8208;component Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with electron&#8208;rich diarylamine unit and electron&#8208;deficient benzothiazole and Co&#8208;porphyrin units, thus overcoming the weak or strong interactions between COFs and intermediates, improving the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance.







Abstract
The catalytic performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the binding strength of the reactants and intermediates. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been adopted to catalyze CO2RR, and their binding abilities are tuned via constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (DA) systems. However, most DA COFs have single donor and acceptor units, which caused wide&#8208;range but lacking accuracy in modulating the binding strength of intermediates. More elaborate regulation of the interactions with intermediates are necessary and challenge to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts. Herein, the three&#8208;component COF with D&#8208;A&#8208;A units was first constructed by introducing electron&#8208;rich diarylamine unit, electron&#8208;deficient benzothiazole and Co&#8208;porphyrin units. Compared with two&#8208;component COFs, the designed COF exhibit elevated electronic conductivity, enhanced reducibility, high efficiency charge transfer, further improving the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance with the faradic efficiency of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high activity with the partial current density of 27.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V which exceed other two&#8208;component COFs. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that catalytic sites in three&#8208;component COF have suitable binding ability of the intermediates, which are benefit for formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of multi&#8208;component COFs, enabling modulated charge transfer to improve the CO2RR activity.

&lt;p&gt;The catalytic performance for electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) depends on the binding strength of the reactants and intermediates. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been adopted to catalyze CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, and their binding abilities are tuned via constructing donor-acceptor (DA) systems. However, most DA COFs have single donor and acceptor units, which caused wide-range but lacking accuracy in modulating the binding strength of intermediates. More elaborate regulation of the interactions with intermediates are necessary and challenge to construct high-efficiency catalysts. Herein, the three-component COF with D-A-A units was first constructed by introducing electron-rich diarylamine unit, electron-deficient benzothiazole and Co-porphyrin units. Compared with two-component COFs, the designed COF exhibit elevated electronic conductivity, enhanced reducibility, high efficiency charge transfer, further improving the electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance with the faradic efficiency of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high activity with the partial current density of 27.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V which exceed other two-component COFs. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that catalytic sites in three-component COF have suitable binding ability of the intermediates, which are benefit for formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of multi-component COFs, enabling modulated charge transfer to improve the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An ultra&#8208;stable two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 for efficient photothermal conversion is reported. Under 808&#8197;nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1&#8201;&#176;C in 6&#8197;seconds. NKU&#8208;123 exhibits a solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9&#8201;% for pure water and seawater, respectively. The role of light&#8208;generated radicals to the photothermal conversion was revealed.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation is a promising strategy for clean water production, which needs the development of solar&#8208;thermal conversion materials with both high efficiency and high stability. Herein, we reported an ultra&#8208;stable cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 with light&#8208;generated radicals, exhibiting superior photothermal conversion efficiency and high stability. Under the irradiation of 808&#8197;nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1&#8201;&#176;C in 6&#8197;seconds. The solar water evaporator based on NKU&#8208;123 achieves a high solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9&#8201;% for pure water and seawater, respectively. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the formation of light&#8208;generated radicals leads to an increase of spin density of NKU&#8208;123 for enhancing the photothermal effect, which provides insights into the design of highly efficient photothermal materials.

         <title>Enhancing Ni/Co Activity by Neighboring Pt Atoms in NiCoP/MXene Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ni/Co can be improved by neighboring Pt atoms in alkaline electrolyte, which can increase water adsorption and decrease dramatically water dissociation energy barrier by interface electron transfer, and even change catalytic route from Heyrovsky to faster Tafel step.







Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate neighboring Pt atoms can enhance the metal activity of NiCoP for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, it remains a great challenge to link Pt and NiCoP. Herein, we introduced curvature of bowl&#8208;like structure to construct Pt/NiCoP interface by adding a minimal 1&#8201;&#8240;&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio Pt. The as&#8208;prepared sample only requires an overpotential of 26.5 and 181.6&#8197;mV to accordingly achieve the current density of 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The water dissociation energy barrier (Ea) has a ~43&#8201;% decrease compared with NiCoP counterpart. It also shows an ultrahigh stability with a small degradation rate of 10.6&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at harsh conditions (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 50&#8201;&#176;C) after 3000&#8197;hrs. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) verify the interface electron transfer lowers the valence state of Co/Ni and activates them. DFT calculations also confirm the catalytic transition step of NiCoP can change from Heyrovsky (2.71&#8197;eV) to Tafel step (0.51&#8197;eV) in the neighborhood of Pt, in accord with the result of the improved Hads at the interface disclosed by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) tests.

         <title>An Artificial Enzyme for Asymmetric Nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes &#8208; Design and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of an abiological catalytic group into the binding pocket of a protein host allows for the expansion of enzyme chemistries. Here, we report the generation of an artificial enzyme by genetic encoding of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid that contains a secondary amine side chain. The non&#8208;canonical amino acid and the binding pocket function synergistically to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes by the iminium activation mechanism. The designer enzyme was evolved to an optimal variant that catalyzes the reaction in high yield with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work demonstrates the application of genetic code expansion in enzyme design and expands the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed abiological reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Pulsed Electroreduction for Boosting the Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea industry protocol. Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system is not easily achievable. Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via pulsed electroreduction. We found that the reconstruction&#8208;resistant CuSiOx nanotube, with abundant atomic Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Si interfacial sites, exhibits ultrastability in the electrosynthesis of urea from nitrate and CO2. Under a pulsed potential approach with optimal operating conditions, the Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Si interfaces achieve a superior urea production rate (1606.1 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1) with high selectivity (79.01%) and stability (the Faradaic efficiency is retained at 80% even after 80 h of testing), outperforming most reported electrocatalytic synthesis urea catalysts. We believe our strategy will incite further investigation into pulsed electroreduction increasing substrate transport, which may guide the design of ambient urea electrosynthesis and other energy conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloro&#8208;Functionalized Ether&#8208;based Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether&#8208;based electrolyte is beneficial to obtaining good low&#8208;temperature performance and high ionic conductivity in potassium ion batteries. However, the dilute ether&#8208;based electrolytes usually result in ion&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation of graphite, poor cycling stability, and hard to withstand high voltage cathodes above 4.0 V. To address the aforementioned issues, an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) was introduced to regulate the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enhance the oxidative stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The dilute (~0.91 M) chloro&#8208;functionalized ether&#8208;based electrolyte not only facilitates the formation of homogeneous dual halides&#8208;based SEI, but also effectively suppress aluminum corrosion at high voltage. Using this functionalized electrolyte, the K||graphite cell exhibits a stability of 700 cycles, the K||Prussian blue (PB) cell (4.3 V) delivers a stability of 500 cycles, and the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell reveals a long stability of 6000 cycles with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Additionally, the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell can operate under a wide temperature range from &#8722;5&#176;C to 45&#176;C. This work highlights the positive impact of electrolyte functionalization on the electrochemical performance, providing a bright future of ether&#8208;based electrolytes application for long&#8208;lasting, wide&#8208;temperature, and high Coulombic efficiency PIBs and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Dynamic Structural Color in a Host&#8208;Guest System for Time&#8208;Dependent Anticounterfeiting and Double&#8208;Lock Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting. However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time&#8208;dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption based on a host&#8208;guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid&#8208;crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre&#8208;designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans&#8208;isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time&#8208;dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state&#8217;s appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host&#8208;guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high&#8208;end applications in information encryption.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting.

         <dc:description>
Based on a computer&#8208;aided ligand design, the first chiral Os(II)/Salox catalytic system is realized to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of dioxazolones with precise site&#8208;/enantioselectivity control and diverse functionality. The catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction mode of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system are also further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
Herein, multiple types of chiral Os(II) complexes have been designed to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, among which the Os(II)/Salox species is found to be the most efficient for precise stereocontrol in realizing the asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation. As exemplified by the enantioenriched pyrrolidinone synthesis, such tailored Os(II)/Salox catalyst efficiently enables an intramolecular site&#8208;/enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation in the &#947;&#8208;position of dioxazolone substrates, in which benzyl, propargyl and allyl groups bearing various substituted forms are well compatible, affording the corresponding chiral &#947;&#8208;lactam products with good er values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and diverse functionality (&gt;35&#8197;examples). The unique performance advantage of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system in terms of the catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction has been further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Nonlinear Photochromic Reaction Based on Sensitizer&#8208;Free Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation in a Perylene&#8208;Substituted Rhodamine Spirolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear photochromic reactions that work with weak incoherent light are important for molecular operation with high spatial resolution, and multiple photofunctions based on single molecules. However, nonlinear photochromic compounds generally require complex molecular design, restricting accessibility in various fields. Herein, we report nonlinear photochromic properties in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam derivative (Rh&#8208;Pe), which is synthesized from rhodamine B in facile procedures. Direct excitation of Rh&#8208;Pe produces the triplet excited state via the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The triplet excited state causes triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation to bring the generation of the intensely&#8208;colored ring&#8208;open form with the nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, green&#8208; and red&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochromism was achieved in Rh&#8208;Pe using triplet sensitizers, although Rh&#8208;Pe can be directly excited only by ultraviolet and blue light. Our findings are expected to contribute to the development of photofunctional materials showing nonlinear behavior and low&#8208;energy light responsivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photocatalysts in the Photoinduced Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds based on derivatives of DMAC&#8208;TRZ, that are strongly photoreducing. Both Eox and thus E*ox could be tuned via substitution of the DMAC donor with a Hammett series of p&#8208;substituted phenyl moieties while Ered remained effectively constant. These compounds were assessed in the photoinduced dehalogenation of aryl halides, and analogues bearing electron withdrawing groups were found to produce the highest yields. Substrates of up to Ered = &#8208;2.72 V could be dehalogenated at low PC loading (1 mol%) and under air, conditions much milder than previously reported for this reaction. Spectroscopic and chemical studies demonstrate that all PCs, including literature reference PCs, photodegrade, and that it is these photodegradation products that are responsible for the reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Silica Confinement for Stable and Magnetic Co&#8208;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia borane (AB) with 19.6 wt.% H2 content is widely considered a safe and efficient medium for H2 storage and release. Co&#8208;based nanocatalysts present strong contenders for replacing precious metal&#8208;based catalysts in AB hydrolysis due to their high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, precisely adjusting the active centers and surface properties of Co&#8208;based nanomaterials to enhance their activity, as well as suppressing the migration and loss of metal atoms to improve their stability, presents many challenges. In this study, mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;confined bimetallic Co&#8208;Cu nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoxCu1&#8208;x@NC@mSiO2) were synthesized using a facile mSiO2&#8208;confined thermal pyrolysis strategy. The obtained product, an optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst, exhibits enhanced performance with a turnover frequency of 240.9 molH2&#8729;molmetal&#8729;min&#8208;1 for AB hydrolysis at 298 K, surpassing most noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts. Moreover, Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 demonstrated magnetic recyclability and extraordinary stability, with a negligible decline of only 0.8% over 30 cycles of use. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Cu, as well as silica confinement. This work proposes a promising method for constructing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for AB hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are in high demand for powering applications in extreme environments. Here, we have developed high&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The lamellae have been aligned parallel to the surface in the dielectric films. This structural arrangement resembles the horizontal alignment of nanosheet fillers in polymer nanocomposites and&#160;nanosheet&#8208;like lamellae in block copolymers, which has been proven to provide the optimal topological structure for electrical energy storage. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films. This novel approach of enhancing the capacitive energy storage properties by controlled orientation of lamellae in homopolymer offers a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Achieving Ultra&#8208;long ORR Durability &#8208; Rh Activates Interatomic Interactions in Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of platinum&#8208;based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh&#8208;doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh&#8208;Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long&#8208;term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh&#8208;Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000 cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 for Rh&#8208;Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200 mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The stability of platinum-based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh-doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh-Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31 A mgPt-1 at 0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long-term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh-Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long-term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000 cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8 A cm-2 for Rh-Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200 mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long-term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis of Oxime Ethers from NOx over Ultrafine MgO Nanoparticles Derived from Mg&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction couples with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Boost the Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Chiral Organometallic Platinum Complexes by Hierarchical Assembly into Fibrillar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular materials have drawn increasing attention due to their promising applications for next&#8208;generation display and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, it is challenging to obtain CPL materials with both large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and high quantum yield (&#934;). A pair of enantiomeric N^N^C&#8208;type Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;1 modified with chiral Leucine methyl ester are presented herein. Though the solutions of these complexes are CPL&#8208;inactive, the spin&#8208;coated thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized phosphorescences with |glum| of 0.53 at 560 nm and &#934;air of ~50%, as well as appealing circular dichroism (CD) signals with the maximum absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.37&#8722;0.43 at 480 nm. This superior CPL performance benefits from the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. Comparative studies of another pair of chiral Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;2 with a symmetric N^C^N coordination mode suggest that the asymmetric N^N^C coordination of (L/D)&#8208;1 are favorable for the efficient exciton delocalization to amplify the CPL performance. Optical applications of the thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing CP light generation from achiral emitters and common light&#8208;emitting diode lamps have been successfully realized.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Scaling Relationship in C&#8208;N Coupling via the Doping Effects for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical C&#8208;N coupling reaction based on carbon dioxide and nitrate have been emerged as a new &#8216;&#8216;green synthetic strategy&#8217;&#8217; for the synthesis of urea, but the catalytic efficiency is seriously restricted by the inherent scaling relations of adsorption energies of the active sites, the improvement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by the decrease in selectivity. Herein, a doping engineering strategy was proposed to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of C&#8208;N coupling. A thus designed SrCo0.39Ru0.61O3&#8208;&#948; catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 1522 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and faradic efficiency of 34.1% at &#8208;0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of characterizations revealed that Co doping not only induces lattice distortion but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) in the SrRuO3. The oxygen vacancies weaken the adsorption of *CO and *NH2 intermediates on the Co and Ru sites respectively, and the strain effects over the Co&#8208;Ru dual sites promoting the occurrence of C&#8208;N coupling of the two monomers instead of selective hydrogenating to form by&#8208;products.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pallamolides A&#8722;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential Michael addition reactions formed the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core of pallamolides A&#8722;E in the first total synthesis of these densely functionalized natural products. The approach also featured a SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization to generate the oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade to assemble the tetracyclic skeleton of the pallamolides.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E. Of these compounds, pallamolides B&#8722;E possess intriguing tetracyclic skeletons with novel intramolecular transesterifications. Key transformations include highly diastereoselective sequential Michael addition reactions to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core with the simultaneous generation of two quaternary carbon centers, a one&#8208;pot SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization/ketone reduction to generate the key oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade sequence to assemble the tetracyclic pallamolide skeleton. Kinetic resolution of ketone 14 through Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata reduction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Activation and Valorization on Metallic Copper and Carbon&#8208;Embedded N&#8208;Coordinated Single Metal MNC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2 (CO2RR) has been studied and compared using copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts. This study explains the reaction mechanisms of CO2RR and identifies future challenges in optimizing catalyst design to improve efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2&#8208;containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure&#8211;activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR. Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today's disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure&#8211;activity&#8208;selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2 electrolyzers over longer times, with larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.

         <title>Carrier Protein Interaction with Competing Adenylation and Epimerization Domains in a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Analyzed by FRET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein (PCP) of each module tethers the amino acid to be incorporated into the peptide product. Its interaction with multiple catalytic domains is barely studied. We reveal a surprising competition of the adenylation (A) and epimerization (E) domains for the PCP in an A&#8208;PCP&#8208;E module. New principles of conformational equilibria emerge that can contrast the anticipated catalytic logic.







Abstract
In multi&#8208;domain nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) the order of domains and their catalytic specificities dictate the structure of the peptide product. Peptidyl&#8208;carrier proteins (PCPs) bind activated amino acids and channel elongating peptidyl intermediates along the protein template. To this end, fine&#8208;tuned interactions with the catalytic domains and large&#8208;scale PCP translocations are necessary. Despite crystal structure snapshots of several PCP&#8208;domain interactions, the conformational dynamics under catalytic conditions in solution remain poorly understood. We report a FRET reporter of gramicidin S synthetase 1 (GrsA; with A&#8208;PCP&#8208;E domains) to study for the first time the interaction between PCP and adenylation (A) domain in the presence of an epimerization (E) domain, a competing downstream partner for the PCP. Bulk FRET measurements showed that upon PCP aminoacylation a conformational shift towards PCP binding to the A domain occurs, indicating the E domain acts on its PCP substrate out of a disfavored conformational equilibrium. Furthermore, the A domain was found to preferably bind the D&#8208;Phe&#8208;S&#8208;Ppant&#8208;PCP stereoisomer, suggesting it helps in establishing the stereoisomeric mixture in favor of the D&#8208;aminoacyl moiety. These observations surprisingly show that the conformational logic can deviate from the order of domains and thus reveal new principles in the multi&#8208;domain interplay of NRPSs.

         <title>Control of the Hydroquinone/Benzoquinone Redox State in High&#8208;Mobility Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel synthetic strategy to modulate the electronic band structure of conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) through control of the redox state of hydroquinone/benzoquinone ligands during synthesis. We successfully synthesized two distinct semiconducting c&#8208;CPs, Ag4TTBQ(TTBQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolbenzoquinone) and Ag4TTHQ(TTHQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolhydroquinone), by reacting TTHQ with silver nitrate and silver acetate, respectively. Despite sharing the same topological structure, charge transport measurements and DFT calculations reveal significant differences in their electronic structures. Notably, Ag4TTHQ demonstrates superior thermoelectric performance compared to other silver&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs. This research unveils a pioneering approach to finely tune the electronic band structure and properties of c&#8208;CPs, and paves the way for advanced applications in high&#8208;performance thermoelectric and electronic devices.







Abstract
Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) are unique organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors with intrinsically high electrical conductivity and excellent charge carrier mobility. However, it remains a challenge in tailoring electronic structures, due to the lack of clear guidelines. Here, we develop a strategy wherein controlling the redox state of hydroquinone/benzoquinone (HQ/BQ) ligands allows for the modulation of the electronic structure of c&#8208;CPs while maintaining the structural topology. The redox&#8208;state control is achieved by reacting the ligand TTHQ (TTHQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolhydroquinone) with silver acetate and silver nitrate, yielding Ag4TTHQ and Ag4TTBQ (TTBQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolbenzoquinone), respectively. In spite of sharing the same topology consisting of a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;S network and HQ/BQ layer, they exhibit different band gaps (1.5&#8197;eV for Ag4TTHQ and 0.5&#8197;eV for Ag4TTBQ) and conductivities (0.4 S/cm for Ag4TTHQ and 10 S/cm for Ag4TTBQ). DFT calculations reveal that these differences arise from the ligand oxidation state inhibiting energy band formation near the Fermi level in Ag4TTHQ. Consequently, Ag4TTHQ displays a high Seebeck coefficient of 330&#8197;&#956;V/K and a power factor of 10&#8197;&#956;W/m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2, surpassing Ag4TTBQ and the other reported silver&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs. Furthermore, terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates high charge mobilities exceeding 130&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s in both Ag4TTHQ and Ag4TTBQ.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of MOF&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Oxide Solid Solution Anchored with Au Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas and C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through crystal engineering and MOF derivation, the Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution anchored with Au nanoparticles can be elaborately designed and synthesized to integrate multiple active sites, achieving photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas and eventually C2 hydrocarbons under simulated solar light irradiation.







Abstract
Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). According to the control experiments and theoretical calculations, the strong interaction between bimetallic oxide solid solution support and Au nanoparticles was found to be beneficial for binding intermediates and reducing CO2 reduction, highlighting the synergy effect of the catalytic system with multiple active sites.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free &#945;&#8208;Acetyl Cinnamate/Acetoacetate Exchange to Enable High Creep&#8208;Resistant Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic instability of dynamic covalent bonds in vitrimers leads to an inherent propensity for creep. A catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;acetyl cinnamate/acetoacetate exchange reaction featuring high energy barrier in bulk was developed, enabling the production of vitrimers with high creep resistance and reprocessability.







Abstract
Vitrimers represent an emerging class of polymeric materials that combine the desirable characteristics of both thermoplastics and thermosets achieved through the design of dynamic covalent bonds within the polymer networks. However, these materials are prone to creep due to the inherent instability of dynamic covalent bonds. Consequently, there are pressing demands for the development of robust and stable dynamic covalent chemistries. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;acetyl cinnamate/acetoacetate (&#945;&#8208;AC/A) exchange reaction to develop vitrimers with remarkable creep resistance. Small&#8208;molecule model studies revealed that the &#945;&#8208;AC/A exchange occurred at temperatures above 140&#8201;&#176;C in bulk, whereas at 120&#8201;&#176;C, this reaction was absent. For demonstration in the case of polymers, copolymers derived from common vinyl monomers were crosslinked with terephthalaldehyde to produce &#945;&#8208;AC/A vitrimers with tunable thermal and mechanical performance. All resulting &#945;&#8208;AC/A vitrimers exhibited high stability, especially in terms of creep resistance at 120&#8201;&#176;C, while retaining commendable reprocessability when subjected to high temperatures. This work showcases the &#945;&#8208;AC/A exchange reaction as a novel and robust dynamic covalent chemistry capable of imparting both reprocessability and high stability to cross&#8208;linked networks.

         <title>Synthetic Peptides: Promising Modalities for the Targeting of Disease&#8208;Related Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acids play pivotal roles in life processes. Their dysregulation is implicated in numerous diseases while therapeutic compounds targeting them remain limited. In this review we focus on synthetic peptides which offer potential solutions for targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes and non&#8208;coding RNAs.







Abstract
DNA and RNA play pivotal roles in life processes by storing and transferring genetic information, modulating gene expression, and contributing to essential cellular machinery such as ribosomes. Dysregulation and mutations in nucleic acid&#8208;related processes are implicated in numerous diseases. Despite the critical impact on health of nucleic acid mutations or dysregulation, therapeutic compounds addressing these biomolecules remain limited. Peptides have emerged as a promising class of molecules for biomedical research, offering potential solutions for challenging drug targets. This review focuses on the use of synthetic peptides to target disease&#8208;related nucleic acids. We discuss examples of peptides targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, including the clinical candidate Omomyc, and compounds designed for regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes. Further, we provide insights into both library&#8208;based screenings and the rational design of peptides to target regulatory human RNA scaffolds and viral RNAs, emphasizing the potential of peptides in addressing nucleic acid&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Galactocation to Sialic Acid on Tumor Cells with A Penta&#8208;Functional Dendritic Probe for Enhanced Immune&#8208;Killing</title>

Enhance immune&#8208;killing: A ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid strategy is designed by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F) to simultaneously block sialic acid and hugely introduce galactose on tumor cells in vivo for the enhancement of immune&#8208;killing.







Abstract
Glycans on tumor cell surface have significant impacts in the immune&#8208;killing process. Here an ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid (Sia) strategy is designed to hugely introduce galactose (Gal) to Sia and on tumor cells in vivo by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F), which efficiently enhances the immune&#8208;killing of tumor cells. The Den@5F contains five different kinds of functional groups, including Gal, Cy5, amino, phenylboronic acid (PBA) and 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;nitrophenoxy) butanoate (mNB), which can be conveniently prepared through a two&#8208;step reaction. After injecting into the tumor&#8208;bearing mouse, Den@5F can efficiently block Sia through the specific recognition between PBA and Sia on tumor cells and hugely introduce Gal through the subsequent photo&#8208;crosslinking between mNB and amino groups to multiply conjugate excessive Den@5Fs. The comprehensively blocked Sia can prevent the immune escape, and the hugely introduced Gal can promote the immune stimulation of the immune cells, which lead to an efficient enhancement of the immune&#8208;killing. The proposed strategy provides a significant and promising tool to promote the clinical immunotherapy of tumor.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Viral Detection Using Electrochemical Kinetic Profiling of Aptamer&#8208;Antigen Recognition in Clinical Samples and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimeric aptamers, real&#8208;time kinetic profiling, and machine learning enable high precision analysis of viruses in a single pot directly in clinical samples.







Abstract
High&#8208;precision viral detection at point of need with clinical samples plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the control of a global pandemic. However, the complexity of clinical samples that often contain very low viral concentrations makes it a huge challenge to develop simple diagnostic devices that do not require any sample processing and yet are capable of meeting performance metrics such as very high sensitivity and specificity. Herein we describe a new single&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step electrochemical method that uses real&#8208;time kinetic profiling of the interaction between a high&#8208;affinity aptamer and an antigen on a viral surface. This method generates many data points per sample, which when combined with machine learning, can deliver highly accurate test results in a short testing time. We demonstrate this concept using both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza A viruses as model viruses with specifically engineered high&#8208;affinity aptamers. Utilizing this technique to diagnose COVID&#8208;19 with 37 real human saliva samples results in a sensitivity and specificity of both 100&#8201;% (27 true negatives and 10 true positives, with 0 false negative and 0 false positive), which showcases the superb diagnostic precision of this method.

         <title>Fundamental Structural and Electronic Understanding of Palladium Catalysts on Nitride and Oxide Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the support type (nitride and oxide) on the charge state of isolated Pd sites has been explored in this work. Furthermore, a correlation was established between the formal oxidation state, the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO, and the computed Bader charge based on the periodic trends in electronegativity, allowing the identification of appropriate models for the understanding of the coordination structure of Pd center.







Abstract
The nature of the support can fundamentally affect the function of a heterogeneous catalyst. For the novel type of isolated metal atom catalysts, sometimes referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts, systematic correlations are still rare. Here, we report a general finding that Pd on nitride supports (non&#8208;metal and metal nitride) features a higher oxidation state compared to that on oxide supports (non&#8208;metal and metal oxide). Through thorough oxidation state investigations by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO&#8208;DRIFTS, and density functional theory (DFT) coupled with Bader charge analysis, it is found that Pd atoms prefer to interact with surface hydroxyl group to form a Pd(OH)x species on oxide supports, while on nitride supports, Pd atoms incorporate into the surface structure in the form of Pd&#8722;N bonds. Moreover, a correlation was built between the formal oxidation state and computational Bader charge, based on the periodic trend in electronegativity.

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzymes Catalyze Heterobicyclic and Spirocyclic Isoquinolone Core Formation in Piperazine Alkaloid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of newly identified alkaloids featuring unique heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, arizonamides and arizolidines, has been characterized. Notably, the non&#8208;heme iron enzyme ParG demonstrated catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. This study has elucidated efficient strategies used by Nature to construct complex multicyclic heterocycle scaffolds.







Abstract
We report the discovery and biosynthesis of new piperazine alkaloids&#8208;arizonamides, and their derived compounds&#8208;arizolidines, featuring heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, respectively. Their biosynthetic pathway involves two crucial non&#8208;heme iron enzymes, ParF and ParG, for core skeleton construction. ParF has a dual function facilitating 2,3&#8208;alkene formation of helvamide, as a substrate for ParG, and oxidative cleavage of piperazine. Notably, ParG exhibits catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. A key amino acid residue Phe67 was characterized to control the formation of the constrained arizonamide B backbone by ParG.

         <dc:description>
A concise synthetic approach to mugineic acid and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established. Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8722;N bonds without redox reactions. Mugineic acid was synthesized on a gram scale, and the dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were taken up by oocytes overexpressing transporters ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human).







Abstract
A succinct synthetic approach to mugineic acids and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established. Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8722;N bonds and is characterized by the absence of redox reactions. Mugineic acid was synthesized from three readily available fragments on a gram scale in 6 steps. The protected 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was also synthesized in 4 steps, and the dansyl group, serving as a fluorophore, was introduced through a click reaction after propargylation of the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy group. The dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were internalized by oocytes overexpressing ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human) transporters, indicating successful transport of the synthesized NA&#8208;probe through these transporters.

         <title>Enhanced Proximity of Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn Ensembles Encaged in UiO&#8208;67 Boosting Catalytic Conversion of Syngas to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 was prepared for direct syngas conversion. With the enhanced proximity of the dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles formed spontaneously in the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, we obtained, for the first time, a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0&#8201;% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4&#8201;% on the monometallic Rh catalyst.







Abstract
Maintaining high conversion under the premise of high oxygenates selectivity in syngas conversion is important but a formidable challenge in Rh catalysis. Monometallic Rh catalysts provide poor oxygenate conversion efficiency, and efforts have been focused on constructing adjacent polymetallic sites; however, the one&#8208;pass yields of C2+ oxygenates over the reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts were mostly &lt;20&#8201;%. In this study, we constructed a monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 (Rh/UiO&#8208;67) with enhanced proximity to dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles. Unexpectedly, this catalyst exhibited high efficacy for oxygenate synthesis from syngas, giving a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0&#8201;% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4&#8201;%, and the one&#8208;pass yield of C2+ oxygenates exceeded 25&#8201;%. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations further revealed the spontaneous formation of an ensemble of Rh single atoms/dimers (Rh1,2) in the proximity of ultrasmall Rh clusters (Rhn) confined within the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, providing adjacent Rh+&#8208;Rh0 dual sites dynamically during the reaction that promote the relay of the undissociated CHO species to the CHx species. Thus, our results open a new route for designing highly efficient Rh catalysts for the conversion of syngas to oxygenates by precisely tuning the ensemble and proximity of the dual active sites in a confined space.

         <title>Metabolic&#8208;Glycoengineering&#8208;Enabled Molecularly Specific Acoustic Tweezing Cytometry for Targeted Mechanical Stimulation of Cell Surface Sialoglycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DBCO&#8208;functionalized microbubbles were attached to azide&#8208;tagged sialoglycans on the cell surface generated by cell metabolic engineering to enable molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry. This novel technology was utilized to study the roles of sialoglycans in mechanotransduction, revealing different mechanical properties and mechanoregulatory activities of sialoglycans from protein sensors like integrins.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a novel type of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;functionalized microbubbles (MBs) and validated their attachment to azide&#8208;labelled sialoglycans on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). This enabled the application of mechanical forces to sialoglycans on hPSCs through molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry (mATC), that is, displacing sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs using ultrasound (US). It was shown that subjected to the acoustic radiation forces of US pulses, sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs exhibited significantly larger displacements and faster, more complete recovery after each pulse than integrin&#8208;anchored MBs, indicating that sialoglycans are more stretchable and elastic than integrins on hPSCs in response to mechanical force. Furthermore, stimulating sialoglycans on hPSCs using mATC reduced stage&#8208;specific embryonic antigen&#8208;3 (SSEA&#8208;3) and GD3 expression but not OCT4 and SOX2 nuclear localization. Conversely, stimulating integrins decreased OCT4 nuclear localization but not SSEA&#8208;3 and GD3 expression, suggesting that mechanically stimulating sialoglycans and integrins initiated distinctive mechanoresponses during the early stages of hPSC differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MGE&#8208;enabled mATC uncovered not only different mechanical properties of sialoglycans on hPSCs and integrins but also their different mechanoregulatory impacts on hPSC differentiation, validating MGE&#8208;based mATC as a new, powerful tool for investigating the roles of glycans and other cell surface biomolecules in mechanotransduction.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expanding Difluorination: An Enantioselective Platform to Access &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Difluorinated Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(I)/I(III)&#8208;catalysed ring expanding fluorination of cyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters has been developed to generate gem&#8208;difluorinated 6&#8211;10 membered rings (up to 95&#8201;%). Validation of an enantiodivergent variant is also disclosed using a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol catalyst (up to 7&#8201;:&#8201;93&#8197;e.r.) and X&#8208;ray analyses of selected products reveals the subtle impact of difluorination on widening the internal &#8736;CCC angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C).







Abstract
Cyclic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;carbonyl compounds have a venerable history as drug discovery leads, but limitations in the synthesis arsenal continue to impede chemical space exploration. This challenge is particularly acute in the arena of fluorinated medium rings where installing the difluoromethylene unit subtly alters the ring conformation by expanding the internal angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C): this provides a handle to modulate physicochemistry (e.g. pKa). To reconcile this disparity, a highly modular ring expansion has been devised that leverages simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides, and processes them to one&#8208;carbon homologated rings with concomitant geminal difluorination (6 to 10 membered rings, up to 95&#8201;% yield). This process is a rare example of the formal difluorination of an internal alkene and is enabled by sequential I(III)&#8208;enabled O&#8208;activation. Validation of enantioselective catalysis in the generation of unprecedented medium ring scaffolds is reported (up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7&#8197;e.r.) together with X&#8208;ray structural analyses and product derivatization.

         <title>From Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2 to Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2: Controlling Sulfur Content in Thiocyanate Systems Significantly Improves the Overall Performance of UV Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first UV NLO crystalline material thiocyanate Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, with a phase&#8208;matching ability non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure was obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, achieving the process from 0 (CS) to 1 (NCS) and unprecedented improvement in comprehensive performance, suggesting Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 is an excellent UV NLO candidate, demonstrating the modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy to develop UV NLO crystals.







Abstract
Combining a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) effect (&gt;1&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)), a large band gap (&gt;4.2&#8197;eV), and a moderate birefringence in ultraviolet (UV) NLO crystals remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, the first example of a thiocyanate capable of realizing a phase&#8208;matched UV NLO crystal material, is obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2. Compared to the &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 has a different sawtooth 1D chain structure. Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2 has second harmonic generation (SHG) inertia with a band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a UV cutoff edge of 342&#8197;nm, however, it possesses a large birefringence (0.35@546&#8197;nm). In contrast, the symmetry center breaking of Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 leads to remarkably strong SHG intensity (10&#8197;times that of KDP). Furthermore, it has a wide band gap (4.74&#8197;eV), short UV cutoff edge (234&#8197;nm), and moderate birefringence capable of phase matching (0.17@546&#8197;nm). This research indicates that thiocyanates are a promising class of UV NLO crystal materials, and that modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy for the development of UV NLO crystals with excellent overall performances.

         <title>Stabilizing Diluted Active Sites of Ultrasmall High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the synthesis of ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles using sintering&#8208;tolerance dopant elements. The diluted active sites on HEI promote the formic acid oxidation reaction and deliver superior poisoning tolerance due to the weak binding of carbon monoxide intermediates and the sluggish diffusion behavior.







Abstract
The poisoning of undesired intermediates or impurities greatly hinders the catalytic performances of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics i&#8208;(PtPdIrRu)2FeCu (HEI) are constructed to inhibit the strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates (CO*) during the formic acid oxidation reaction. As probed by multiple&#8208;scaled structural characterizations, HEI nanoparticles are featured with partially negative Pt oxidation states, diluted Pt/Pd/Ir/Ru atomic sites and ultrasmall average size less than 2&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the optimized structures, HEI nanoparticles deliver more than 10&#8197;times promotion in intrinsic activity than that of pure Pt, and well&#8208;enhanced mass activity/durability than that of ternary i&#8208;Pt2FeCu intermetallics counterpart. In situ infrared spectroscopy manifests that both bridge and top CO* are favored on pure Pt but limited on HEI. Further theoretical elaboration indicates that HEI displayed a much weaker binding of CO* on Pt sites and sluggish diffusion of CO* among different sites, in contrast to pure Pt that CO* bound more strongly and was easy to diffuse on larger Pt atomic ensembles. This work verifies that HEIs are promising catalysts via integrating the merits of intermetallics and high&#8208;entropy alloys.

         <title>Electrochemical Azo&#8208;free Mitsunobu&#8208;type Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, featuring azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope, is reported. This practical method allows facial enantiospecific coupling of diverse heterepcycles and chiral alcohols. This useful method is readily used in the modification of diverse bioactive natural products and multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.







Abstract
The classic chemical Mitsunobu reaction suffers from the need of excess alcohol activation reagents and the generation of significant by&#8208;products. Efforts to overcome these limitations have resulted in numerous creative solutions, but the substrate scope of these catalytic processes remains limited. Here we report an electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, which features azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope. This user&#8208;friendly technology allows a vast collection of heterocycles as the nucleophile, which can couple with a series of chiral cyclic and acyclic alcohols in moderate to high yields and excellent ee's. This practical reaction is scalable, chemoselective, uses simple Electrasyn setup with inexpensive electrodes and requires no precaution to exclude air and moisture. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated on the structural modification of diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical derivatives and its straightforward application in a multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, historically used for reactions like the Birch reduction and Crich addition, has experienced a significant revival with the advent of electrochemistry and photochemistry. Recent advances in this area are depicted, highlighting reduction processes such as dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, and other hydrofunctionalizations, while also showcasing their applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Dearomative partial reduction is an extraordinary approach for transforming benzenoid arenes and has been well&#8208;known for many decades, as exemplified by the dehydrogenation of Birch reduction and the hydroarylation of Crich addition. Despite its remarkable importance in synthesis, this field has experienced slow progress over the last half&#8208;century. However, a revival has been observed with the recent introduction of electrochemical and photochemical methods. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements in dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, including dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, arylation, alkenylation, amination, borylation and others. Further, the intriguing utilization of dearomative partial reduction in the synthesis of natural products is also emphasized. It is anticipated that this Minireview will stimulate further progress in arene dearomative transformations.

         <title>Robust Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production: Linkage Position Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linkage position matters: Changing para&#8208; to ortho&#8208;position linkage in covalent organic framework photocatalysts results in a high hydrogen peroxide rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water without sacrificial reagents, and significantly improved long&#8208;term continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance from about 6 to 48&#8197;h.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. However, the nature of organic polymers makes the balance between high activity and stability challenging. We demonstrate that the linkage position matters in the design of robust COF photocatalysts with durable high activity without sacrificial reagents. COFs with ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;linkages (o&#8208;COFs and p&#8208;COFs) were constructed by 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol with benzene&#8208;, pyridine&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;orthodiamines and paradiamines. The pyrzaine&#8208;containing o&#8208;COFs with two pyridinic nitrogen atoms exhibited a H2O2 production rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 together with long&#8208;time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance in pure water (48&#8197;h), superior to the corresponding p&#8208;COFs. A four&#8208;step reaction mechanism is proposed by density function calculations. Moreover, the active sites and origin of stability enhancement for o&#8208;COFs are clarified. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy in the design of robust COF photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis.

A single&#8208;atomic Al&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts is developed for ORR, featuring a well&#8208;designed Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No active center with the axial pyrrolyl N ligands (No). The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No catalysts exhibit excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability







Abstract
The main group metals are commonly perceived as catalytically inert in the context of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) due to the delocalized valence orbitals. Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;Nx) is a promising approach to accelerate catalytic dynamics. Herein, we, for the first time, report the atomically dispersed Al catalysts coordinated with N and C atoms for 4&#8208;electron ORR. The axial coordinated pyrrolyl N group (No) is constructed in the Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No moiety to regulate the p&#8208;band structure of Al center, effectively steering the local environment and structure of the square planar Al&#8208;N4 sites, which typically exhibit too strong interaction with ORR intermediates. The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. The as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability, along with the rapid kinetics as demonstrated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. This work offers a fundamental comprehension of the fine regulation on p&#8208;band and guides the rational design of main&#8208;group metal&#8208;based single atom catalysts.

         <title>Biomimetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C Quadruplex within a Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based Octacationic Spirobicycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In biological systems, nucleotide quadruplexes (such as G&#8208;quadruplexes) in DNA and RNA that are held together by multiple hydrogen bonds play a crucial functional role. The biomimetic formation of these hydrogen&#8208;bonded quadruplexes captured by artificial systems in water poses a significant challenge but can offer valuable insights into these complex functional structures. Herein, we report the formation of biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C quadruplex captured by a tetraphenylethene (TPE) based octacationic spirobicycle (1). The spirobicyclic compound possesses a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crossing dual&#8208;cavity structure, which enables the encapsulation of four d(GpC) dinucleotide molecules, thereby realizing 1:4 host&#8208;guest complexation in water. The X&#8208;ray structure reveals that four d(GpC) molecules further form a two&#8208;layer G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C quadruplex with Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized within the dual hydrophobic cavities of 1 through the cooperative non&#8208;covalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, and hydrophobic effect. Due to the dynamically&#8208;rotational propeller chirality of TPE units, 1 with adaptive chirality can further serve as a chiroptical sensor to exhibit opposite Cotton effects with mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of d(GpC) including the Watson&#8208;Crick G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C (pH 9.22) and Hoogsteen G&#8226;C+&#8226;G&#8226;C+ (pH 5.74) quartets through the host&#8208;guest chirality transfer in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom substitution strategy modulates thermodynamics towards chemically recyclable polyesters and monomeric unit sequence by temperature switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we proposed a heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS) in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system to modulate thermodynamics toward chemically recyclable polyesters. In this system, three VL&#8208;based monomers containing different heteroatoms (M1 (N), M2 (S), and M3 (O)), instead of C&#8208;5 carbon, were designed and synthesized to verify our proposed HSS. All three monomers undergo organocatalytic living/controlled ROP and controllable depolymerization. Impressively, the resulting P(M1) achieved over 99% monomer recovery under both mild solution depolymerization and high vacuum pyrolysis conditions without any side reactions, and the recycled monomers can be polymerized again forming new polymers. The systematic study of the relationship between heteroatom substitution and recyclability shows that introducing heteroatoms does change the thermodynamics of the monomers (&#916;Hpo, &#916;Spo and Tc values), thereby adjusting the polymerizability and depolymerizability. DFT calculations found that the introduction of heteroatoms adjusts the ring strain by changing the angular strain of the monomers, and the order of their angular strain (M2&gt;M1&gt;M3) is consistent with the order of the experimentally obtained enthalpy change. Notably, the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step copolymerization of two of each of the three monomers enables the synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled copolymers from gradient to random to block structures, by simply switching the copolymerization temperature.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at MALAT1 A8422, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylating function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Inorganic Dimensionality of Ultrastable Lead Halide Coordination Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a coordination chemistry strategy to modulate the 2D to 3D transformation of lead iodide sublattices in robust coordination polymers. The synthetic strategy enhances the charge&#8208;transport properties for efficient carrier accumulation and introduces asymmetric charge distribution for C&#8722;C coupling, leading to efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction to C2 products.







Abstract
Lead halide hybrids have shown great potentials in CO2 photoreduction, but challenging to afford C2+ reduced products, especially using H2O as the reductant. This is largely due to the trade&#8208;off problem between instability of the benchmark 3D structures and low carrier mobility of quasi&#8208;2D analogues. Herein, the lead halide dimensionality of robust coordination polymers (CP) was modulated by organic ligands differing in a single&#8208;atom change (NH vs. CH2), in which the NH groups coordinate with interlamellar [PbI2] clusters to achieve the important 2D&#8594;3D transition. This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25&#8197;meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C2H5OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI2] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Based Photoenzymatic Nano&#8208;reactor for Asymmetric Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we described a multi&#8208;functional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir, which was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework material COF&#8208;Ir. The bio&#8208;nanoreactor could serve as efficient catalyst in dynamic kinetic resolution of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor showed high stability and reusability.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;catalysis represents a highly efficient and stereoselective method for the synthesis of valuable chiral compounds, however, the poor stability and limited reaction types of free enzymes restrict their wide application in industrial production. In this work, to overcome these problems, a multifunctional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework COF&#8208;Ir. This bio&#8208;nanocluster serves as efficient catalysts in asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The well&#8208;designed COF&#8208;Ir not only acts as safety cover to prevent CALB from deactivation but promotes racemization of secondary amines via photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. Photoelectric characterization and TDDFT calculation revealed that (ppy)2Ir units in COF&#8208;Ir play crucial role in this photocatalytic system which enhance its photo&#8208;redox properties through facilitating the separation between photoelectrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+). Furthermore, the heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor could be recycled for five rounds with slight decline of catalytic reactivity.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Utilization of Latent Heat in Erythritol&#8208;based Phase Change Materials as Solar Thermal Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an erythritol&#8208;based phase change material as a new type of solar thermal fuels. The material can harvest, convert, and store solar energy as latent heat, which can be released as thermal energy on demand. The composite material is cost&#8208;effective, easy to synthesize, and has a superior solar thermal energy utilization performance. This new concept could promote related solar energy utilization techniques.







Abstract
Solar thermal fuels (STFs) have been particularly concerned as sustainable future energy due to their impressive ability to store solar energy in chemical bonds and controllably release thermal energy. However, currently studied STFs mainly focus on molecule&#8208;based materials with high photochemical activity, toxicity, and compromised features, which greatly restricts their applications in practical scenarios of solar energy utilization. Herein, we present a novel erythritol&#8208;based composite phase change material (PCM) as a new type of STFs with an outstanding capability to store solar energy as latent heat in its stable supercooling state and release thermal energy as needed. This composite PCM with stored thermal energy can be maintained stably at room temperature and subsequently release latent heat as high as 224.9&#8197;J/g during the crystallization process triggered by thermal stimuli. Remarkably, solar energy can be converted into latent heat stored in the composite PCM over months. Through mechanical stimulations, the released latent heat can increase the temperature of the composite up to 91&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a new concept of using spatiotemporal storage and release of latent heat in PCMs for solar energy utilization, making it a potential candidate as STFs for developing future clean energy techniques.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Linker Strategy for Selective Activation of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy to overcome the off&#8208;target toxicity of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a hypoxia&#8208;activated, azobenzene&#8208;based linker for the tumour&#8208;specific release of cytotoxic payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The novel ADC exhibits potent antitumor efficacy and dramatically increases the therapeutic window compared with a traditional ADC, providing a dual&#8208;targeting antibody/linker double prodrug (pro&#8208;prodrug).







Abstract
Existing antibody&#8211;drug conjugate (ADC) linkers, whether cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable, are designed to release highly toxic payloads or payload derivatives upon internalisation of the ADCs into cells. However, clinical studies have shown that only &lt;1&#8201;% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in tumour cells. The remaining &gt;99&#8201;% of ADCs are nonspecifically distributed in healthy tissue cells, thus inevitably leading to off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we describe an intelligent tumour&#8208;specific linker strategy to address these limitations. A tumour&#8208;specific linker is constructed by introducing a hypoxia&#8208;activated azobenzene group as a toxicity controller. We show that this azobenzene&#8208;based linker is non&#8208;cleavable in healthy tissues (O2 &gt;10&#8201;%), and the corresponding payload derivative, cysteine&#8208;appended azobenzene&#8208;linker&#8211;monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), can serve as a safe prodrug to mask the toxicity of MMAE (switched off). Upon exposure to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment (O2&lt;1&#8201;%), this linker is cleaved to release MMAE and fully restores the high cytotoxicity of the ADC (switched on). Notably, the azobenzene linker&#8208;containing ADC exhibits satisfactory antitumour efficacy in vivo and a larger therapeutic window compared with ADCs containing traditional cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable linkers.

     alt="Azobenzene-Based Linker Strategy for Selective Activation of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a strategy to overcome the off-target toxicity of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a hypoxia-activated, azobenzene-based linker for the tumour-specific release of cytotoxic payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The novel ADC exhibits potent antitumor efficacy and dramatically increases the therapeutic window compared with a traditional ADC, providing a dual-targeting antibody/linker double prodrug (pro-prodrug).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing antibody&#8211;drug conjugate (ADC) linkers, whether cleavable or non-cleavable, are designed to release highly toxic payloads or payload derivatives upon internalisation of the ADCs into cells. However, clinical studies have shown that only &amp;lt;1&#8201;% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in tumour cells. The remaining &amp;gt;99&#8201;% of ADCs are nonspecifically distributed in healthy tissue cells, thus inevitably leading to off-target toxicity. Herein, we describe an intelligent tumour-specific linker strategy to address these limitations. A tumour-specific linker is constructed by introducing a hypoxia-activated azobenzene group as a toxicity controller. We show that this azobenzene-based linker is non-cleavable in healthy tissues (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;10&#8201;%), and the corresponding payload derivative, cysteine-appended azobenzene-linker&#8211;monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), can serve as a safe prodrug to mask the toxicity of MMAE (switched off). Upon exposure to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;1&#8201;%), this linker is cleaved to release MMAE and fully restores the high cytotoxicity of the ADC (switched on). Notably, the azobenzene linker-containing ADC exhibits satisfactory antitumour efficacy in vivo and a larger therapeutic window compared with ADCs containing traditional cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Thus, our azobenzene-based linker sheds new light on the development of next-generation ADC linkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hybrid Redox&#8208;Mediated Zinc&#8208;Air Fuel Cell for Scalable and Sustained Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell that liberates the zinc reaction from the electrode to a separate fuel tank was demonstrated, which enabled a facile zinc refueling in the tank and attained a record&#8208;high power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah by optimizing system kinetics. The zinc evolution mechanism during redox&#8208;mediated reaction was unveiled for the first time using various in situ characterization techniques.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have attracted considerable attention for their high energy density, safety, low noise, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, the capacity of mechanically rechargeable ZABs was limited by the cumbersome procedure for replacing the zinc anode, while electrically rechargeable ZABs suffer from issues including low depth of discharge, zinc dendrite and dead zinc formation, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, etc. To address these issues, we report a hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell (HRM&#8208;ZAFC) utilizing 7,8&#8208;dihydroxyphenazine&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (DHPS) as the anolyte redox mediator, which shifts the zinc oxidation reaction from the electrode surface to a separate fuel tank. This approach decouples fuel feeding and electricity generation, providing greater operation flexibility and scalability for large&#8208;scale power generation applications. The DHPS&#8208;mediated ZAFC exhibited a superior peak power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and a continuous discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah with ZnO as the discharge product in the tank, highlighting its potential for power generation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Oxo Electronic Tuning via In Situ CO Decoration for Promoting Methane Conversion to Oxygenates over Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

In situ CO decoration can significantly tune the electronic state of metal&#8208;oxo center in single&#8208;atom catalysts for promoting oxygenates production. CO activated Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 displays the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8722;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 ever reported at room temperature and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C&#8208;atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd1, which donates electrons to the Pd1&#8722;O active center (L&#8722;Pd1&#8722;O, L=CO) generated by H2O2 oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8722;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8722;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 (M=Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2&#8211;11.3&#8197;times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal&#8208;oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.

         <title>COF&#8208;Topological Quantum Material Nano&#8208;heterostructure for CO2 to Syngas Production under Visible Light</title>

COF&#8208;topological quantum material (COF@TI) nano&#8208;heterostructure serves as an efficient catalyst for solar enegy driven syngas production with controllable ratios (CO: H2) from CO2 and H2O.







Abstract
Efficient solar&#8208;driven syngas production (CO+H2 mixture) from CO2 and H2O with a suitable photocatalyst and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism are the desired approach towards the carbon recycling process. Herein, we report the design and development of an unique COF&#8208;topological quantum material nano&#8208;heterostructure, COF@TI with a newly synthesized donor&#8208;acceptor based COF and two dimensional (2D) nanosheets of strong topological insulator (TI), PbBi2Te4. The intrinsic robust metallic surfaces of the TI act as electron reservoir, minimising the fast electron&#8208;hole recombination process, and the presence of 6s2 lone pairs in Pb2+ and Bi3+ in the TI helps for efficient CO2 binding, which are responsible for boosting overall catalytic activity. In variable ratio of acetonitrile&#8208;water (MeCN&#8201;:&#8201;H2O) solvent mixture COF@TI produces syngas with different ratios of CO and H2. COF@TI nano&#8208;heterostructure enables to produce higher amount of syngas with more controllable ratios of CO and H2 compared to pristine COF. The electron transfer route from COF to TI was realized from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, charge density difference calculation, excited state lifetime and photoelectrochemical measurements. Finally, a probable mechanistic pathway has been established after identifying the catalytic sites and reaction intermediates by in situ DRIFTS study and DFT calculation.

         <title>An N&#8208;Heterocyclic Quinodimethane: A Strong Organic Lewis Base Exhibiting Diradical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ) is reported. In its closed&#8208;shell ground state, the NHQ is a strong organic base whose proton affinity exceeds that of analogous N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. Moreover, the NHQ exhibits radical reactivity and undergoes dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway.







Abstract
We report the preparation of a new organic &#963;&#8208;donor with a C6H4&#8208;linker between an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and an exocyclic methylidene group, which we term N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ). The aromatization of the C6H4&#8208;linker provides a decisive driving force for the reaction of the NHQ with an electrophile and renders the NHQ significantly more basic than analogous NHCs or N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), as shown by DFT computations and competition experiments.

&lt;p&gt;The preparation of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ) is reported. In its closed-shell ground state, the NHQ is a strong organic base whose proton affinity exceeds that of analogous &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic olefins. Moreover, the NHQ exhibits radical reactivity and undergoes dehydrogenative head-to-head dimerization via an open-shell singlet pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the preparation of a new organic &#963;-donor with a C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-linker between an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and an exocyclic methylidene group, which we term &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ). The aromatization of the C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-linker provides a decisive driving force for the reaction of the NHQ with an electrophile and renders the NHQ significantly more basic than analogous NHCs or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), as shown by DFT computations and competition experiments. In solution, the NHQ undergoes an unprecedented dehydrogenative head-to-head dimerization by C&#8722;C coupling of the methylidene groups. DFT computations indicate that this reaction proceeds via an open-shell singlet pathway revealing the diradical character of the NHQ. The product of this dimerization can be described as conjugated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic bis-quinodimethane, which according to cyclic voltammetry is a strong organic reducing agent (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleic Acids in a Diffusiophoretic Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steep salt gradient generated by an electrolyte&#8208;filled micropipette can be utilized for diffusiophoretic trapping of charged colloids and molecules. The trap can localize, concentrate and promote hybridization between complementary DNA strands, and facilitate the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures into DNA gels. Assembly of the gel only occurs under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, when the salt gradient is present.







Abstract
The formation and dissociation of duplexes or higher order structures from nucleic acid strands is a fundamental process with widespread applications in biochemistry and nanotechnology. Here, we introduce a simple experimental system&#8212;a diffusiophoretic trap&#8212;for the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly of nucleic acid structures that uses an electrolyte gradient as the driving force. DNA strands can be concentrated up to hundredfold by a diffusiophoretic trapping force that is caused by the electric field generated by the electrolyte gradient. We present a simple equation for the field to guide selection of appropriate trapping electrolytes. Experiments with carboxylated silica particles demonstrate that the diffusiophoretic force is long&#8208;ranged, extending over hundreds of micrometers. As an application, we explore the reversible self&#8208;assembly of branched DNA nanostructures in the trap into a macroscopic gel. The structures assemble in the presence of an electrolyte gradient, and disassemble upon its removal, representing a prototypical adaptive response to a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium state.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Dimer Decay Responsible for Gem&#8208;Dicarbonyl Formation on a Model Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;lapse scanning tunneling microscopy movies are combined with theoretical computations to study CO adsorption on a model Rh1/Fe3O4(001) catalyst under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Direct CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results in monocarbonyl species. Rh1&#8722;(CO)2 gem dicarbonyl species are observed, but from only via the CO&#8208;induced break&#8208;up of Rh2 dimer species.







Abstract
The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide&#8208;spread applicability of single&#8208;atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single&#8208;crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh1 adatoms and minority Rh2 dimers on Fe3O4(001) during exposure to CO using time&#8208;lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results exclusively in stable Rh1CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo&#8208;square planar environment. Rh1(CO)2 gem&#8208;dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh2 dimers via an unstable Rh2(CO)3 intermediate. Overall, our results illustrate how minority species invisible to area&#8208;averaging spectra can play an important role in catalytic systems, and show that the decomposition of dimers or small clusters can be an avenue to produce reactive, metastable configurations in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Phase Identification and Discovery of an Elusive Polymorph of Drug&#8208;Polymer Inclusion Complex Using Automated 3D Electron Diffraction</title>

An automated low&#8208;dose 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) protocol was developed to identify and determine the structures of six phases of griseofulvin in a multiphasic melt&#8208;crystallisation product. 3D ED data were collected from over 230 individual nano&#8208;sized crystals and processed without supervision, enabling the discovery of a new griseofulvin polyethylene glycol inclusion complex. This study highlights 3D ED&#8242;s potential in drug development.







Abstract
3D electron diffraction (3D ED) has shown great potential in crystal structure determination in materials, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. In this work, an automated, low&#8208;dose and low&#8208;bias 3D ED protocol has been implemented to identify six phases from a multiple&#8208;phase melt&#8208;crystallisation product of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, griseofulvin (GSF). Batch data collection under low&#8208;dose conditions using a widely available commercial software was combined with automated data analysis to collect and process over 230 datasets in three days. Accurate unit cell parameters obtained from 3D ED data allowed direct phase identification of GSF Forms III, I and the known GSF inclusion complex (IC) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;I), as well as three minor phases, namely GSF Forms II, V and an elusive new phase, GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;II. Their structures were then directly determined by 3D ED. Furthermore, we reveal how the stabilities of the two GSF&#8208;PEG IC polymorphs are closely related to their crystal structures. These results demonstrate the power of automated 3D ED for accurate phase identification and direct structure determination of complex, beam&#8208;sensitive crystallisation products, which is significant for drug development where solid form screening is crucial for the overall efficacy of the drug product.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Probes for Imaging Detection of Enzyme Activities by NIR Luminescence, T1&#8208; and ParaCEST MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that using a single ligand complexed to different lanthanide ions, successful visualization of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity is possible in complementary optical and MR modalities : NIR luminescence (Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and T1 (Gd3+) MR imaging.







Abstract
Applying a single molecular probe to monitor enzymatic activities in multiple, complementary imaging modalities is highly desirable to ascertain detection and to avoid the complexity associated with the use of agents of different chemical entities. We demonstrate here the versatility of lanthanide (Ln3+) complexes with respect to their optical and magnetic properties and their potential for enzymatic detection in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1 MR imaging, controlled by the nature of the Ln3+ ion, while using a unique chelator. Based on X&#8208;ray structural, photophysical, and solution NMR investigations of a family of Ln3+ DO3A&#8208;pyridine model complexes, we could rationalize the luminescence (Eu3+, Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and relaxation (Gd3+) properties and their variations between carbamate and amine derivatives. This allowed the design of 
 probes which undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated changes detectable in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI, respectively governed by variations in their absorption energy, in their exchanging proton pool and in their size, thus relaxation efficacy. We demonstrate that these properties can be exploited for the visualization of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in phantom samples by different imaging modalities: NIR optical imaging, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI.

Based on X-ray structural, photophysical, and solution NMR investigations of a family of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; DO3A-pyridine model complexes, we could rationalize the luminescence (Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), CEST (Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) and relaxation (Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) properties and their variations between carbamate and amine derivatives. This allowed the design of 
 probes which undergo enzyme-mediated changes detectable in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1-weighted MRI, respectively governed by variations in their absorption energy, in their exchanging proton pool and in their size, thus relaxation efficacy. We demonstrate that these properties can be exploited for the visualization of &#946;-galactosidase activity in phantom samples by different imaging modalities: NIR optical imaging, CEST and T1-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Synthesis of Propargyl&#8208; and Allenylsilanes through Catalytic Propargylic C&#8722;H Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular propargylic C&#8722;H silylation mediated by an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir complex. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric, synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity.







Abstract
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric and synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity. In the case of unsymmetrical dialkyl acetylenes, good to excellent selectivity for functionalization at the less&#8208;hindered site was also observed. A variety of electrophilic silyl sources (R3SiOTf and R3SiNTf2), either commercial or in situ&#8208;generated, were used as the silylation reagents, and a broad range of simple and functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkyl acetylenes, dialkyl acetylenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and drug derivatives were successfully employed as substrates. Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;&#8208;complexation&#8208;assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer&#8208;sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Sensor Array Formed by Poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Fluorophores for Sensitive Multiplexed Bacterial Recognition</title>

A dual fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor array, assembled from poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) complexes through electrostatic interactions, facilitates the detection of bacteria at low concentrations. This versatile approach significantly enhances the sensitivity of sensing systems, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics.







Abstract
Bacterial infections have emerged as the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;channel fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor array, comprising six electrostatic complexes formed from one negatively charged poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and six positively charged aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores. The 6&#8208;element array enabled the simultaneous identification of 20&#8197;bacteria (OD600=0.005) within 30s (99.0&#8201;% accuracy), demonstrating significant advantages over the array constituted by the 7 separate elements that constitute the complexes. Meanwhile, the array realized different mixing ratios and quantitative detection of prevalent bacteria associated with urinary tract infection (UTI). It also excelled in distinguishing six simulated bacteria samples in artificial urine. Remarkably, the limit of detection for E. coli and E. faecalis was notably low, at 0.000295 and 0.000329 (OD600), respectively. Finally, optimized by diverse machine learning algorithms, the designed array achieved 96.7&#8201;% accuracy in differentiating UTI clinical samples from healthy individuals using a random forest model, demonstrating the great potential for medical diagnostic applications.

         <title>Depicting the Chemical Diversity of Bioactive Meroterpenoids Produced by the Largest Organism on Earth</title>

Exploring melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids from Armillaria ostoyae in liquid and solid fermentations yielded 17 new and 21 known derivatives. A compound library enabled metabolomics, unveiling production patterns under varied culture conditions. Assessment of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, aided by innovative chemoinformatics, offered insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
In this investigation, we explored the diversity of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids produced by Armillaria ostoyae, one of the largest and oldest organisms on Earth, using extracts from liquid and solid fermentation media. The study unveiled three unprecedented dimeric bismelleolides and three novel fatty&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted congeners, along with 11 new and 21 known derivatives. The structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and HRESI&#8208;MS, and ROESY spectral analysis for relative configurations. Absolute configurations were determined from crystal structures and through ECD spectra comparison. A compound library of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids facilitated metabolomics&#8208;wide associations, revealing production patterns under different culture conditions. The library enabled assessments of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, revealing that the &#916;2,4 double bond is not crucial for antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity was linked to the presence of an aldehyde at C1, but lost with hydroxylation at C13. Chemoinformatic analyses demonstrated the intricate interplay of chemical modifications on biological properties. This study marks the first systematic exploration of Armillaria spp. meroterpenoid diversity by MS&#8208;based untargeted metabolomics, offering insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships through innovative chemoinformatics.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Two&#8208;Dimensional Defective Bi Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets were reconstructed in situ to defective Bi nanosheets, forming rich grain boundaries that were conducive to the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for CO2 and NO3&#8722; reduction to produce urea.







Abstract
Abstract:Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two&#8208;dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi2Se3 nanosheets under electrochemical CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets obtained by NaBH4&#8208;assisted cryo&#8208;mediated liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries (GBs; GB&#8208;rich Bi). The reconstructed GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 32&#8201;% for urea production at &#8722;0.40&#8197;V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2&#8197;times higher than those of the low&#8208;GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH2 intermediate formation energy and C&#8722;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure&#8208;activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.

The reconstructed GB-rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Faradaic efficiency of 32&#8201;% for urea production at &#8722;0.40&#8197;V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2&#8197;times higher than those of the low-GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate formation energy and C&#8722;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB-rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure-activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Flavins Photochemical Activity in Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Triplet Sensitization through Ring&#8208;Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of ester&#8208;modified flavins with hydroxide base leads to ring&#8208;contracted imidazolonequinoxalines with increased triplet energy (ET) and H&#8208;atom abstraction (HAT) strength in the photochemically excited state. Ring&#8208;contracted flavins are efficient catalysts in the trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic C&#8722;H positions and also in multi&#8208;step sequences, which require the combined activity as triplet sensitizer and hydrogen atom abstractor.







Abstract
The isoalloxazine heterocycle of flavin cofactors reacts with various nucleophiles to form covalent adducts with important functions in enzymes. Molecular flavin models allow for the characterization of such adducts and the study of their properties. A fascinating set of reactions occurs when flavins react with hydroxide base, which leads to imidazolonequinoxalines, ring&#8208;contracted flavins, with so far unexplored activity. We report a systematic study of the photophysical properties of this new chromophore by absorption and emission spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Excited, ring&#8208;contracted flavins are significantly stronger hydrogen atom abstractors when compared to the parent flavins, which allowed the direct trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic methine positions (bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 400.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). In an orthogonal activity, their increased triplet energy (E(S0&#8592;T1)=244&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) made sensitized reactions possible which exceeded the power of standard flavins. Combining both properties, ring&#8208;contracted flavin catalysts enabled the one&#8208;pot, five&#8208;step transformation of &#945;&#8208;tropolone into trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentanones. We envision this new class of flavin&#8208;derived chromophores to open up new modes of reactivity that are currently impossible with unmodified flavins.

         <title>Confining Polymer Electrolyte in MOF for Safe and High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>

A polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, exhibiting unusual properties: enhanced sodium ion conductivity and transference number, wider electrochemical voltage windows, and dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, even at high working temperature.







Abstract
Nanoconfined polymer molecules exhibit profound transformations in their properties and behaviors. Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the anions, facilitating the Na ion dissociation from salt. Simultaneously, the well&#8208;defined nanopores within ZIF&#8208;8 particles provide oriented and ordered migration channels for Na migration. As a result, this pioneering design allows the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.89 V vs. Na/Na+. The assembled SSMBs (with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode) exhibit dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96&#8201;% capacity retention over 300&#8197;cycles. This innovative polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF design offers a compelling strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance and safe solid&#8208;state metal battery technologies.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the interaction between H2O and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been first explored. The H2O molecular changes the electronic states of COFs and the possible catalytic center's locations. The COF based on the pyridine N linkers showed higher activity than those COFs based on other kinds of N atoms.







Abstract
Binding water molecules to polar sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is inevitable, but the corresponding solvent effects in electrocatalytic process have been largely overlooked. Herein, we investigate the solvent effects on COFs for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our designed COFs incorporated different kinds of nitrogen atoms (imine N, pyridine N, and phenazine N), enabling tunable interactions with water molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating electronic states and altering the catalytic centers within the COFs. Among the synthesized COFs, the one with pyridine N atoms exhibits the highest activity, with characterized by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78&#8197;V and a mass activity of 0.32&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which surpass those from other metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the stronger binding ability of *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridine N sites. This work sheds light on the significance of considering solvent effects on COFs in electrocatalytic systems, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization for improved performance.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using CO2&#8208;Binding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel promiscuous activity of the phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis and other CO2&#8208;binding enzymes is described. The enzymes catalyze the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of a Ru(bpy)3 photosensitizer, exhibiting high selectivity for CO2 reduction over proton reduction (up to 93&#8201;%). Remarkably, BsPAD itself does not require an additional metal cofactor for this catalysis.







Abstract
Novel concepts to utilize carbon dioxide are required to reach a circular carbon economy and minimize environmental issues. To achieve these goals, photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, thermal&#8208;, and biocatalysis are key tools to realize this, preferentially in aqueous solutions. Nevertheless, catalytic systems that operate efficiently in water are scarce. Here, we present a general strategy for the identification of enzymes suitable for CO2 reduction based on structural analysis for potential carbon dioxide binding sites and subsequent mutations. We discovered that the phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPAD) promotes the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction selectively to carbon monoxide in the presence of a ruthenium photosensitizer and sodium ascorbate. With engineered variants of BsPAD, TONs of up to 978 and selectivities of up to 93&#8201;% (favoring the desired CO over H2 generation) were achieved. Mutating the active site region of BsPAD further improved turnover numbers for CO generation. This also revealed that electron transfer is rate&#8208;limiting and occurs via multistep tunneling. The generality of this approach was proven by using eight other enzymes, all showing the desired activity underlining that a range of proteins is capable of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Observation of Iron with Eight Coordination in Iron Trifluoride under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diminutive ionic radius of fluorine implies probable hypercoordination in Fe&#8722;F systems. Employing sophisticated crystal structure prediction and high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature experiments, a stable orthorhombic phase of FeF3 featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is revealed under extreme conditions. This discovery advances comprehension of iron&#8208;based structure and contributes to exploring chemical hypercoordination phenomena.







Abstract
The chemistry of hypercoordination has been a subject of fundamental interest, especially for understanding structures that challenge conventional wisdom. The small ionic radii of Fe ions typically result in coordination numbers of 4 or 6 in stable Fe&#8208;bearing ionic compounds. While 8&#8208;coordinated Fe has been observed in highly compressed oxides, the pursuit of hypercoordinated Fe still faces significant challenges due to the complexity of synthesizing the anticipated compound with another suitable anion. Through first&#8208;principles simulation and advanced crystal structure prediction methods, we predict that an orthorhombic phase of FeF3 with exclusively 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is energetically stable above 18&#8197;GPa&#8212;a pressure more feasibly achieved compared to oxides. Inspired by this theoretical result, we conducted extensive experiments using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell technique to investigate the crystal structures of FeF3 at high&#8208;pressure conditions. We successfully synthesized the predicted orthorhombic phase of FeF3 at 46&#8197;GPa, as confirmed by in situ experimental X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This work establishes a new ionic compound featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe in a simple binary Fe&#8208;bearing system and paves the way for discovering Fe hypercoordination in similar systems.

         <title>Biocatalytic Steroidal 9&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation and Fragmentation Enable the Concise Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Secosteroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ten 9,10&#8208;secosteroids were synthesized from readily available steroids in three to eight steps via a chemoenzymatic approach. The key feature lies in utilizing the Rieske oxygenase 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as a biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through a 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade.







Abstract
9,10&#8208;Secosteroids are an important group of marine steroids with diverse biological activities. Herein, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for the concise, modular, and scalable synthesis of ten naturally occurring 9,10&#8208;secosteroids from readily available steroids in three to eight steps. The key feature lies in utilizing a Rieske oxygenase&#8208;like 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as the biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation. With synthesized 9,10&#8208;secosteroides, structure&#8211;activity relationship was evaluated based on bioassays in terms of previously unexplored anti&#8208;infective activity. This study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway through which 9,10&#8208;secosteroids are formed in nature shares a similar 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade. In addition to the development of a biomimetic approach for 9,10&#8208;secosteroid synthesis, this study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how molecular vibrations influence the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of double helicenes DPC and DNH. It highlights how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, emphasizing the role of Herzberg&#8208;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.







Abstract
The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of S&#8208; and X&#8208;shaped double helicenes exhibit distinct vibrational structures and overall shape variations. In this study, we conducted an in&#8208;depth investigation into the vibronic effects influencing the CPL spectra of two double helicenes, namely DPC and DNH. Employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations utilizing the FC&#8208;HT1|VH model at the CAM&#8722;B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP level, we unveiled the paramount impact of Franck&#8211;Condon (FC), Herzberg&#8208;Teller (HT), and Duschinsky effects on their chiroptical responses. Our research underscores the pivotal role of structural deformations associated with the S1&#8208;to&#8208;S0 electronic transition in molding CPL spectra and wavelength&#8208;dependent dissymmetry (g) factor values, as well as the significance of HT effects in shaping and enhancing CPL responses. This extensive investigation not only advances our comprehension of the vibronic characteristics in configurationally distinct double helicenes but also offers valuable insights for the design of chiral molecules featuring controllable or finely&#8208;tunable CPL responses.

         <title>Directing in Vitro Selection towards G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming Aptamers to Inhibit HMGB1 Pathological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of G&#8208;rich oligonucleotides, effective G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming aptamers against HMGB1, a protein involved in inflammation and cancer, were identified. L12 was selected as the best performing aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, along with strong anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity and good HMGB1&#8208;binding affinity, which indicate it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.







Abstract
In the search for novel, effective inhibitors of High&#8208;Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1)&#8212;a protein involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer&#8212;we herein discovered a set of anti&#8208;HMGB1 G&#8208;quadruplex(G4)&#8208;forming aptamers by using an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotides. The selected DNA sequences were then studied in a pseudo&#8208;physiological buffer mimicking the extracellular medium, where HMGB1 exerts its pathological activity, using spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and chromatographic techniques. All the oligonucleotides proved to fold into monomeric G4s and in some cases also dimeric species, stable at physiological temperature. Remarkably, the protein preferentially recognized the sequences forming dimeric parallel G4 structures, as evidenced by a properly designed chemiluminescent binding assay which also highlighted a good selectivity of these aptamers for HMGB1. Moreover, all aptamers showed anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity, inhibiting protein&#8208;induced cell migration. The acquired data allowed identifying L12 as the best anti&#8208;HMGB1 aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, no toxicity at least up to 5&#8197;&#956;M concentration on healthy cells, along with potent anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity (IC50 ca. 28&#8197;nM) and good binding affinity for the protein, thus indicating it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.

We developed a bio&#8208;inspired strategy for single&#8208;cell encapsulation by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator (DFN) to guide the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. The tetrahedral DFN could stably anchor on the cell membrane, resulting in a uniform and flexible cell encapsulation that persisted for 72&#8197;h. This encapsulation could maintain cell viability and protect cells against mechanical stress&#8208;induced autophagy.







Abstract
Encapsulating individual mammalian cells with biomimetic materials holds potential in ex vivo cell culture and engineering. However, current methodologies often present tradeoffs between homogeneity, stability, and cell compatibility. Here, inspired by bacteria that use proteins stably anchored on their outer membranes to nucleate biofilm growth, we develop a single&#8208;cell encapsulation strategy by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator (DFN) to initiate the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. We find that among the tested structures, the tetrahedral DFN can evenly and stably reside on cell membranes, effectively initiating hybridization chain reactions which generate homogeneously dense yet flexible single&#8208;cell encapsulation for diverse cell lines. The encapsulation persists for up to 72&#8197;hours in a serum&#8208;containing cell culture environment, representing a ~70&#8208;fold improvement compared to encapsulations mediated by single&#8208;stranded DNA nucleators. The metabolism and proliferation of the encapsulated cells are suppressed, but can be restored to the original efficiencies upon release, suggesting the superior cell compatibility of the encapsulation. We also find that compared to naked cells, the encapsulated cells exhibit a lower autophagy level after undergoing mechanical stress, suggesting the protective effect of the DNA encapsulation. This method may provide a new tool for ex vivo cell engineering.

         <title>Low&#8208;coordination Nanocrystalline Copper&#8208;based Catalysts through Theory&#8208;guided Electrochemical Restructuring for Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electrochemical restructuring calculation of Cu catalysts, a customized, low&#8208;coordination Cu catalyst was prepared for the efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethylene. Benefiting from this excellent catalyst, the selectivity of CO2 conversion to ethylene reached 72% at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a durable stability of 230 hours in an electrolyzer.







Abstract
Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low&#8208;coordination copper&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70&#8201;% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230&#8197;hours at a cell voltage of 3.5&#8197;V in a full&#8208;cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.

         <title>A non&#8208;metal single atom nanozyme for cutting off the energy and reducing power of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE) was developed as a biosafe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts. SeSAE exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimic activity, effectively disrupting cellular energy and reduction equivalents to suppress tumors. The comprehensive investigation of SeSAE, from theoretical calculations to in vivo antitumor pathways, promises valuable insights into the translation of single atom nanozymes.







Abstract
Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.

         <title>Fe, N&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Redistribution in NiCo Spinel on Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon for Bi&#8208;functional Oxygen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4 catalysts were designed through the interface electron redistribution strategy. Due to the doping of Fe and N, the Co, Ni sites promotes the coordination and dissociation of water and the oxygen reduction. The formation of Ni&#8722;VO&#8722;Fe structure accelerates the oxygen evolution reaction. Electron regulation among Multiple active sites provides positive effect on the reversible conversion of oxygen.







Abstract
Herein, an interfacial electron redistribution is proposed to boost the activity of carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4 catalyst toward oxygen conversion via Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy. Fe&#8208;doping into octahedron induces a redistribution of electrons between Co and Ni atoms on NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon. The increased electron density of Co promotes the coordination of water to Co sites and further dissociation. The generation of proton from water improves the overall activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The increased electron density of Ni facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies. The Ni&#8722;VO&#8722;Fe structure accelerates the deprotonation of *OOH to improve the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). N&#8208;doping modulates the electron density of carbon to form active sites for the adsorption and protonation of oxygen species. Fir wood&#8208;derived carbon endows catalyst with an integral structure to enable outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon express high half&#8208;wave potential up to 0.86&#8197;V in ORR and low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in OER. The zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) assembled with the as&#8208;prepared catalyst achieve long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 2000&#8197;cycles) with peak power density (180&#8197;mWcm&#8722;2). Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy drives the catalysis of biomass&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based catalysts to the highest level for the oxygen conversion in ZABs.

         <title>Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks: Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Conversion of Porous Structures and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photoresponsive porous frameworks were created by integrating protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units onto pore walls of 1D channels, constructing a broad spectrum of photoresponsive pores. The frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights, convert pores into new ones via photoisomerization, and achieve benchmark changes in pore size, shape, number, and environment as well as gas uptake and release, opening a way to novel smart porous materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a novel class of crystalline porous polymers that enable molecular design of extended polygonal skeletons to attain well&#8208;defined porous structures.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of photoresponsive porous frameworks were created by integrating protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units onto pore walls of 1D channels, constructing a broad spectrum of photoresponsive pores. The frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights, convert pores into new ones via photoisomerization, and achieve benchmark changes in pore size, shape, number, and environment as well as gas uptake and release, opening a way to novel smart porous materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks are a novel class of crystalline porous polymers that enable molecular design of extended polygonal skeletons to attain well-defined porous structures. However, construction of a framework that allows remote control of pores remains a challenge. Here we report a strategy that merges covalent, noncovalent, and photo chemistries to design photoresponsive frameworks with reversibly and remotely controllable pores. We developed a topology-guided multicomponent polycondensation system that integrates protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units as photoresponsive sites on pore walls at predesigned densities, so that a series of crystalline porous frameworks with the same backbone can be constructed to develop a broad spectrum of pores ranging from mesopores to micropores. Distinct from conventional azobenzene-based systems, the tetrafluoroazobenzene frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights to undergo high-rate isomerization. The photoisomerization exerts profound effects on pore size, shape, number, and environment, as well as molecular uptake and release, rendering the system able to convert and switch pores reversibly and remotely with visible lights.

         <title>Air&#8208;Promoted Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production from Bioethanol over Core/Shell Cr2O3@GaN Nanoarchitecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air is explored as a promoter rather than quencher for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from bioethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture, showing an impressive H2 evolution rate by only feeding ethanol, air, and light without notable degradation over 180&#8197;hours operation. Value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds are simultaneously generated.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from biomass derivatives offers a path towards carbon neutrality. It is often however operated with the limitations of sluggish kinetics and severe coking. Herein, a disruptive air&#8208;promoted strategy is explored for efficient and durable light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from ethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture. The correlative computational and experimental investigations show ethanol is energetically favorable to be adsorbed on the Cr2O3@GaN interface, followed by dehydrogenation toward acetaldehyde and protons by photoexcited holes. The released protons are then consumed for H2 evolution by photogenerated electrons. Afterward, O2 can be evolved into active oxygen species and promote the deprotonation and C&#8722;C cleavage of the key C2 intermediate, thus significantly lowering the reaction energy barrier of hydrogen evolution and removing the carbon residual with inhibited overoxidation. Consequently, hydrogen is produced at a high rate of 76.9&#8197;mole H2 per gram Cr2O3@GaN per hour by only feeding ethanol, air, and light, leading to the achievement of a turnover number of 266,943,000&#8197;mole H2 per mole Cr2O3 over a long&#8208;term operation of 180&#8197;hours. Notably, an unprecedented light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 17.6&#8201;% is achieved under concentrated light illumination. The simultaneous generation of aldehyde from ethanol dehydrogenation enables the process more economically promising.

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Supramolecular Polymers for Recyclable Photobiocatalytic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying enzymes with supramolecular polymers created SupEnzyme, endowing them with supramolecular functions and responsiveness to guest polymers. This approach significantly enhances enzyme recycling and offers advantages for photobiocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies. In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase&#8197;B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates through supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80&#8201;% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.

         <dc:description>
The first general method for accessing various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters through the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids is reported. The activation effect of ZnCl2 on acyloxy(phenyltrifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes has been studied by DFT calculations and control experiments. The reaction can be used for late&#8208;stage modification of drugs and bioactive carboxylic acids as well.







Abstract
Here we report the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids via the formation and activation of acyloxy(phenyl)trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes. The method provides an easy access to various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters. A remarkably wide range of substrates with commonly encountered functional groups are compatible with this reaction, including aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the enhanced reactivity by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) were discussed from experimental evidence and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

         <dc:description>
We prepared homogeneous Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt high&#8208;entropy solid solutions with adjustable compositisions as multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts for NOx reduction. The elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover were well&#8208;coupled on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, mainly responsible for the superior activities over pure Rh.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with four, five or more metals significantly can yield the developments of functional materials with excellent performances in various reactions. However, the underlying reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis for HEA have been rarely investigated, due to their diverse elements and complex compositions. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneously dispersed Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt HEA with adjustable compositions, as the multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (MASC). In the NOx reduction performance tests, Ru0.4 (Rh0.33Pd0.33Pt0.33)0.6 MASC showed the highest activity, which was significantly improved compared to that of the best monometal Rh, with the light&#8208;off temperature decreasing by ca. 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the outstanding activity of Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt MASC was attributable to the well&#8208;coupled elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, which explained the first clear reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis for HEA.

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a surface&#8208;lattice&#8208;doping (SLD) strategy for the stabilization of the solid electrolyte/cathode interface for its working at a high voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. Specifically, a uniform AlPO4 coating layer was built with nanometer precision around the LiCoO2 (LCO) particle. The following sintering at high temperature induced a homogeneous Al3+ diffusion into the LCO crust, leading to a controlled degree of surface Al/Co/Li disorder together with the formed Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 islands decorating the LCO surface. We found that this SLD strategy is capable of not only suppressing the structural degradation of LCO itself, but also effectively mitigating the decomposition of the chloride&#8208;based solid electrolyte at the interface, thereby ensuring the assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a LiCoO2 cathode excellent cycling stability at 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8211;solid&#8211;state Li&#8211;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8211;doped, cation&#8211;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8211;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8211;salt&#8211;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5&#8197;V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8211;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5&#8197;V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8211;based ASSBs at high voltages.

         <title>Engineering Anti&#8208;CRISPR Proteins to Create CRISPR&#8208;Cas Protein Switches for Activatable Genome Editing and Viral Protease Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of orthogonal protease&#8208;responsive Cas12a protein switches are presented by leveraging Anti&#8208;CRISPR proteins as modular components under the rational guidance of computational chemistry&#8208;directed protein interface engineering. The protein switches facilitate the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function high switching ratios, allowing activatable genome editing and sensitive viral protease detection.







Abstract
Proteins capable of switching between distinct active states in response to biochemical cues are ideal for sensing and controlling biological processes. Activatable CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems are significant in precise genetic manipulation and sensitive molecular diagnostics, yet directly controlling Cas protein function remains challenging. Herein, we explore anti&#8208;CRISPR (Acr) proteins as modules to create synthetic Cas protein switches (CasPSs) based on computational chemistry&#8208;directed rational protein interface engineering. Guided by molecular fingerprint analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, and binding free energy calculations, we rationally engineer the molecular interaction interface between Cas12a and its cognate Acr proteins (AcrVA4 and AcrVA5) to generate a series of orthogonal protease&#8208;responsive CasPSs. These CasPSs enable the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function with high switching ratios (up to 34.3&#8208;fold). These advancements enable specific proteolysis&#8208;inducible genome editing in mammalian cells and sensitive detection of viral protease activities during virus infection. This work provides a promising strategy for developing CRISPR&#8208;Cas tools for controllable gene manipulation and regulation and clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Supported Silver Catalysts through Al modification for Efficient Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we synthesized an Ag/Al&#8722;MnO2 catalyst by metal&#8208;modification engineering to simultaneously improve the catalytic activity and selectivity for ethylene epoxidation. Experimental and theoretical results showed that the Al modification tailored the 3d state of Ag on MnO2 through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs). These targeted effects enhanced the catalytic selectivity and overcame the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in heterogeneous catalysis, providing a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for heterogeneous oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;modified catalysts have attracted extraordinary research attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their enhanced geometric and electronic structures and outstanding catalytic performances. Silver (Ag) possesses necessary active sites for ethylene epoxidation, but the catalyst activity is usually sacrificed to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene oxide (EO). Herein, we report that using Al can help in tailoring the unoccupied 3d state of Ag on the MnO2 support through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs), overcoming the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for ethylene epoxidation and resulting in a very high ethylene conversion rate (~100&#8201;%) with 90&#8201;% selectivity for EO under mild conditions (170&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSIs obtained by the Al modification tailor the unoccupied 3d state of Ag, modulating the adsorption of ethylene (C2H4) and oxygen (O2) and facilitating EO desorption, resulting in high C2H4 conversion. Meanwhile, the increased number of positively charge Ag+ lowers the energy barrier for C2H4(ads) oxidation to produce oxametallacycle (OMC), inducing the unexpectedly high EO selectivity. Such an extraordinary electronic promotion provides new promising pathways for designing advanced metal catalysts with high activity and selectivity in selective oxidation reactions.

         <dc:description>
The present work reports a versatile strategy involving engineering long&#8208;wavelength rhodol derivatives by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms, thereby aiding in eliminating probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF) of far&#8208;red to NIR II probes and creating ultra&#8208;sensitive fluorescence probes with a robust turn&#8208;on response (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). These novel probes enable accurate detection and quantification of biomarkers in abnormal physiological processes (p53 abnormalities) and diseases (tumor metastases).







Abstract
Abnormal physiological processes and diseases can lead to content or activity fluctuations of biocomponents in organelles and whole blood. However, precise monitoring of these abnormalities remains extremely challenging due to the insufficient sensitivity and accuracy of available fluorescence probes, which can be attributed to the background fluorescence arising from two sources, 1) biocomponent autofluorescence (BCAF) and 2) probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF). To overcome these obstacles, we have re&#8208;engineered far&#8208;red to NIR II rhodol derivatives that possess weak BCAF interference. And a series of &#8220;zero&#8221; PIF sensing&#8208;platforms were created by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms. Leveraging these advancements, we devised various ultra&#8208;sensitive NIR indicators, achieving substantial fluorescence boosts (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). Among these indicators, 8&#8208;LAP demonstrated accurate tracking and quantifying of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in whole blood at various stages of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, coupling 8&#8208;LAP with an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting element enabled the detection of ERAP1 activity in HCT116 cells with p53 abnormalities. This delicate design of eliminating PIF provides insights into enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of existing fluorescence probes toward the detection and imaging of biocomponents in abnormal physiological processes and diseases.

A trisulfur radical anion (S3.&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) has been developed. This domino protocol is featured by no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;pot reaction. A plausible mechanism has been proposed by control experiments, intermediate trapping experiments, etc. The unique unsymmetric structure of DBTDT endows it with herringbone packing structure and weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules as well as high transfer integrals, which enables a high carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Unsymmetric organic semiconductors have many advantages such as good solubility, rich intermolecular interactions for potential various optoelectronic applications. However, their synthesis is more challenging due to intricate structures thus normally suffering tedious synthesis. Herein, we report a trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8901;&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) using readily available 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;ethynylbenzenes as starting materials. This domino protocol features no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in a one&#8208;pot reaction. Mechanistic study revealed a unique domino radical anion pathway. Single crystal structure analysis of unsymmetric DBTDT shows that its unique unsymmetric structure endows rich and multiple weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules, which enables the large intermolecular transfer integrals of 86&#8197;meV and efficient charge transport performance with a carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This study provides a facile and highly efficient synthetic strategy for more high&#8208;performance unsymmetric organic semiconductors.

         <title>Regulating Hydrogen/Oxygen Species Adsorption via Built&#8208;in Electric Field &#8208;Driven Electron Transfer Behavior at the Heterointerface for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work&#8208;function difference&#8208;induced formation of BEF can drive the asymmetrical charge distribution of heterostructure WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalysts through electronic transfer behaviors and manipulate the d band structure of active sites, thereby optimizing intermediate adsorption energy and accelerating reaction kinetics of the overall water splitting process.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) plays a crucial role in the realization of a hydrogen economy. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal to achieving high&#8208;efficiency AWE. Herein, WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon nanofiber (WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF) with abundant interfaces is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the electron transfer behavior from Mo2C to WC1&#8208;x, the electrocatalysts of WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF exhibit superior HER and OER performance. Furthermore, when employed as anode and cathode in membrane electrode assembly devices, the WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and remarkable stability for 100&#8197;hours at a high current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 towards overall water splitting. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulation reveal that modulation of the d&#8208;band center for WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF, achieved through the asymmetric charge distribution resulting from the built&#8208;in electric field induced by work function, enables optimization of adsorption strength for hydrogen/oxygen intermediates, thereby promoting the catalytic kinetics for overall water splitting. This work provides promising strategies for designing highly active catalysts in energy conversion fields.

         <title>The Role of Phase Mixing Degree in Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction on Cu&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation on defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction by mixing various phases. The efficiency of C&#8722;C coupling increased with phase mixing degree of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, with a maximum FE of 81&#8201;% toward C2+ products. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the increased phase mixing degree facilitated *CO formation and retention at low and high overpotential, respectively.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C&#8722;C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu&#8208;based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81&#8201;% at maximum. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C&#8722;C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C&#8722;C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu&#8208;base catalysts.

         <title>Build a High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Introducing Competitive Coordination Induction Effect in Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. The intrinsic mechanism of CCIE and its effects on both the Li+ conductivity and the interfacial stability at RT were clarified. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability and cycling performance at 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li+ conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application. Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs+&#8230;TFSI&#8722;&#8230;Li+, Cs+&#8230;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8230;Li+ and 2,4,6&#8208;TFA&#8230;Li&#8230;TFSI&#8722;) from the competitive cation (Cs+ from CsPF6) and molecule (2,4,6&#8208;TFA: 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li+ is constructed enabling a high efficient Li+ migration at 30&#8201;&#176;C (Li+ conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1; tLi+=0.61). Since Cs+ tends to be enriched at the interface, TFSI&#8722; and PF6&#8722; in situ form LiF&#8208;Li3N&#8208;Li2O&#8208;Li2S enriched solid electrolyte interface with electrostatic shielding effects. The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO4: 147.44&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@1&#8197;C and 107.41mAhg&#8722;1@2&#8197;C) and cycling stability at 30&#8201;&#176;C (LiFePO4:94.65&#8201;%@200cycles@0.5&#8197;C; LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2: 94.31&#8201;%@200&#8197;cycles@0.3&#8197;C). This work proposes a concept of CCIE and reveals its mechanism in designing PICE with high ionic conductivity as well as high interfacial compatibility at near RT for high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer-inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application. Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO-based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;b&gt;&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;b&gt;&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;b&gt;&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 2,4,6-TFA&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) from the competitive cation (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from CsPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and molecule (2,4,6-TFA: 2,4,6-trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is constructed enabling a high efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration at 30&#8201;&#176;C (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; t&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;

The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4:&lt;/sub&gt; 147.44&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@1&#8197;C and 107.41mAhg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@2&#8197;C) and cycling stability at 30&#8201;&#176;C (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:94.65&#8201;%@200cycles@0.5&#8197;C; LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 94.31&#8201;%@200&#8197;cycles@0.3&#8197;C).

         <title>Highly Selective and Efficient Perdeuteration of n&#8208;Pentane via H/D Exchange Catalyzed by a Silica&#8208;Supported Hafnium&#8208;Iridium Bimetallic Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel hafnium&#8208;iridium complex immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach is used to prepare a novel hafnium&#8208;iridium catalyst immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, featuring well&#8208;defined [&#8801;SiOHf(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;H)3IrCp*] surface sites. Unlike the monometallic analogous materials Hf/SiO2 and Ir/SiO2, which promote n&#8208;pentane deuterogenolysis through C&#8722;C bond scission, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (1&#8197;bar D2, 250&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8197;h, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the heterobimetallic catalyst HfIr/SiO2 is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis (&lt;2&#8201;% at 95&#8201;% conversion). Furthermore this HfIr/SiO2 catalyst is robust and can be re&#8208;used several times without evidence of decomposition. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin macrocycle is designed, which fuses quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties. A high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, improved average voltage, outstanding energy density and durable cyclability.







Abstract
Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08&#8197;V), and outstanding energy density (365&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 71.6&#8201;% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.

         <title>Singlet Fission in a New Series of Systematically Designed Through&#8208;space Coupled Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of through&#8208;space tetracene oligomers demonstrates sub&#8208;picosecond singlet fission, as revealed by femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. These oligomers exhibit a remarkably high yield of the triplet pair state, a characteristic seldom observed in tetracene derivatives owing to the unfavorable energetics associated with their singlet and triplet energy levels.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) holds great promise for current photovoltaic technologies, where tetracenes, with their relatively high triplet energies, play a major role for application in silicon&#8208;based solar cells. However, the SF efficiencies in tetracene dimers are low due to the unfavorable energetics of their singlet and triplet energy levels. In the solid state, tetracene exhibits high yields of triplet formation through SF, raising great interest about the underlying mechanisms. To address this discrepancy, we designed and prepared a novel molecular system based on a hexaphenylbenzene core decorated with 2 to 6 tetracene chromophores. The spatial arrangement of tetracene units, induced by steric hindrance in the central part, dictates through&#8208;space coupling, making it a relevant model for solid&#8208;state chromophore organization. We then revealed a remarkable increase in SF quantum yield with the number of tetracenes, reaching quantitative (196&#8201;%) triplet pair formation in hexamer. We observed a short&#8208;lived correlated triplet pair and limited magnetic effects, indicating ineffective triplet dissociation in these through&#8208;space coupled systems. These findings emphasize the crucial role of the number of chromophores involved and the interchromophore arrangement for the SF efficiency. The insights gained from this study will aid designing more efficient and technology&#8208;compatible SF systems for applications in photovoltaics.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Steric Hindrance and Excited State for Anti&#8208;Quenching and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation results in high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorophores (IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz) with anti&#8208;quenching behavior and fast spin&#8208;flip. A device based on IDAD&#8208;BNCz with a high doping level of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% shows a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold great promise for advanced high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. However, persistent challenges, such as severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and slow spin&#8208;flip, hinder their optimal performance. We propose a synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which is demonstrated by two blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz, bearing sterically demanding 8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IDAD) and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (TIDAD), respectively. These rigid and bulky IDAD/TIDAD moieties, with appropriate electron&#8208;donating capabilities, not only effectively mitigate ACQ, ensuring efficient luminescence across a broad range of dopant concentrations, but also induce high&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited states that facilitate triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip without causing undesired emission redshift or spectral broadening. Consequently, implementation of a high doping level of IDAD&#8208;BNCz resulted in highly efficient narrowband electroluminescence, featuring a remarkable full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. The combined steric and electronic effects arising from the steric&#8208;hindered donor introduction offer a compelling molecular design strategy to overcome critical challenges in MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Supramolecular Modular Assembly of Imaging&#8208;Trackable Enzymatic Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular assembly platform based on Janus hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle was synthesized by surface chemistry and physical deposition technology. Through host&#8211;guest interaction, different engine and imaging modules modified by corresponding guest or host molecules can be quickly assembled to build various imaging&#8208;trackable enzymatic nanomotors on&#8208;demand, which can readily meet the needs of different application scenarios.







Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great application potential in biomedicine, sensing, environmental remediation, etc. In the past decade, various strategies or technologies have been used to prepare and functionalize MNMs. However, the current preparation strategies of the MNMs were mainly following the pre&#8208;designed methods based on specific tasks to introduce expected functional parts on the various micro/nanocarriers, which lacks a universal platform and common features, making it difficult to apply to different application scenarios. Here, we have developed a modular assembly strategy based on host&#8211;guest chemistry, which enables the on&#8208;demand construction of imaging&#8208;trackable nanomotors mounted with suitable driving and imaging modules using a universal assembly platform, according to different application scenarios. These assembled nanomotors exhibited enhanced diffusion behavior driven by enzymatic reactions. The loaded imaging functions were used to dynamically trace the swarm motion behavior of assembled nanomotors with corresponding fuel conditions both in vitro and in vivo. The modular assembly strategy endowed with host&#8211;guest interaction provides a universal approach to producing multifunctional MNMs in a facile and controllable manner, which paves the way for the future development of MNMs systems with programmable functions.

         <title>Probing Coordination Number of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by d&#8208;Band Center&#8208;Regulated Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the d&#8208;band center as a bridge, the correlation between the coordination number (CN) and the acetone cataluminescence (CTL) was established. A versatile d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone CTL platform was thus developed for the rapid measurement of the CN of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).







Abstract
It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X&#8208;ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt&#8208;SACs. It is disclosed that the CN&#8208;triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d&#8208;band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone&#8208;CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe&#8208;SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated CTL.

         <title>A Triply Linked Porphyrin&#8208;Norcorrole Hybrid with Singlet Diradical Character</title>

meso&#8211;meso, &#946;&#8211;&#946;, &#946;&#8211;&#946; Triply&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8211;norcorrole hybrids and meso&#8211;meso singly&#8208;linked hybrids were synthesized through intramolecular homocoupling of precursors, respectively. The molecular structures of porphyrin&#8211;norcorrole hybrids have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The triply&#8208;linked hybrid exhibits a warped structure and shows a significantly small electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45&#8197;eV). Furthermore, the triply&#8208;linked hybrid displays singlet diradical characteristics.







Abstract
Norcorrole Ni(II) complexes have recently received considerable attention because they are readily accessible antiaromatic molecules. Their high stability under ambient conditions and ease of synthesis have enabled the exploration of the intrinsic properties of antiaromatic molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of meso&#8211;meso singly linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrids and a triply linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrid. The singly linked and triply linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrids were fully characterized, including an X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Due to their orthogonal conformation, the singly linked hybrids maintain the individual electronic properties of their porphyrin and norcorrole subunits, while the triply linked hybrid shows a significantly smaller electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45&#8197;eV) than that of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole (1.08&#8197;eV). Furthermore, the triply linked hybrid exhibits singlet diradical characteristics, as confirmed by VT&#8197;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Polylactic Acid Waste into Alanine under Mild Conditions</title>

A one&#8208;pot photoreforming route was reported for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP in situ grown on CdS can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation for the coproduction of alanine with high activity (2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&gt;75&#8201;%).







Abstract
Polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable plastic because it can be degraded into CO2 and H2O in nature. However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO2&#8208;emitting and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post&#8208;consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastic economy. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with a high selectivity (&gt;75&#8201;%) and excellent stability. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation to coproduce alanine. This study offers an appealing way for upcycling PLA waste and creates new opportunities for green synthesis of amino acids.

         <title>Formamidinium Lead Iodide&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25&#8201;% Enabled by An Amphiphilic Molecular Hole&#8208;Transporter</title>

A phenothiazine&#8208;based molecular hole&#8208;transporter (PTZ&#8722;CPA) carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group is developed for the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in the highest solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion efficiencies of 25.35&#8201;% under standard air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight.







Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted&#8208;structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film&#8208;forming on hydrophobic or defective hole&#8208;transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole&#8208;transporter, (2&#8208;(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ&#8722;CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ&#8722;CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole&#8208;selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective material (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8722;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8722;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four&#8208;fold) and Shockley&#8208;Read&#8208;Hall lifetime (eight&#8208;fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8722;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole&#8208;collection. Consequently, FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35&#8201;% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8722;CPA based device shows commendable long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Topology Controlled All&#8208;(Meth)acrylic Thermoplastic Elastomers by Multi&#8208;Functional Lewis Pairs&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;initiating Lewis pairs are developed to realize living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, achieving not only ultrahigh molecular weight polyacrylates (Mn up to 2174&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1), but also control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star) in one&#8208;step manner. The produced star triblock TPEs exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and excellent AIE effects.







Abstract
It remains challenging to synthesize all&#8208;(meth)acrylic triblock thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), due to the drastically different reactivities between the acrylates and methacrylates and inevitable occurrence of side reactions during polymerization of acrylates. By taking advantage of the easy structural modulation features of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), we design and synthesize strong nucleophilic tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based NHOs varying in the number (i.e. mono&#8208;, dual&#8208; and tetra&#8722;) of initiating functional groups. Its combination with bulky organoaluminum [iBuAl(BHT)2] (BHT=bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tBu&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy)) constructs Lewis pair (LP) to realize the living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, furnishing polyacrylates with ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn up to 2174&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1) within 4&#8197;min. Moreover, these NHO&#8208;based LPs enable us to not only realize the control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star), but also achieve triblock star copolymers in one&#8208;step manner. Mechanical studies reveal that the star triblock TPEs exhibit better mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 1863&#8201;% and tensile strength up to 19.1&#8197;MPa) in comparison with the linear analogs. Moreover, the presence of tetraphenylethylene group in the NHOs entitled the triblock TPEs with excellent AIE properties in both solution and solid state.

         <title>Harmonizing Plasmonic and Photonic Effects to Boost Photocatalytic H2 Production over 550&#8201;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1</title>

Plasmonic photonic crystal enables efficient hydrogen evolution from water by harmonizing competing photonic and plasmonic effects to effectively trap and concentrate light onto plasmonic catalysts. This design demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution at 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic catalyst by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other emerging high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with photonic crystals holds immense potential to enhance green hydrogen photosynthesis by amplifying localized electromagnetic field through generating surface plasmons and slow photons. Current plasmonic photonic designs primarily employ semiconductor&#8208;based structural backbone deposited with plasmonic nanoparticles. However, the competition between various optical phenomena in these ensembles hinders effective field enhancement rather than facilitating it. This limitation creates a formidable performance bottleneck that retards hydrogen evolution. Herein, we enhance plasmonic catalysis for efficient hydrogen evolution by effectively harmonizing plasmonic and photonic effects. This is achieved by using inert SiO2 opal as a non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic framework. By aligning the excitation wavelengths of surface plasmons and slow photons, our optimized plasmonic photonic crystals demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic Ag nanoparticles by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold. Mechanistic studies highlight the pivotal role of the non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic backbone in facilitating effective light confinement through the photonic effect. This in turn boosts the plasmonic field for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution, even without needing additional co&#8208;catalysts. Our work offers valuable insights for future design of electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts to achieve efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical transformations in diverse energy, chemical, and environmental applications.

Current plasmonic photonic designs primarily employ semiconductor-based structural backbone deposited with plasmonic nanoparticles. However, the competition between various optical phenomena in these ensembles hinders effective field enhancement rather than facilitating it. This limitation creates a formidable performance bottleneck that retards hydrogen evolution. Herein, we enhance plasmonic catalysis for efficient hydrogen evolution by effectively harmonizing plasmonic and photonic effects. This is achieved by using inert SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; opal as a non-photoabsorbing photonic framework. By aligning the excitation wavelengths of surface plasmons and slow photons, our optimized plasmonic photonic crystals demonstrates a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ag&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing bare plasmonic Ag nanoparticles by &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-fold and other high-performance photocatalytic designs by 280-fold. Mechanistic studies highlight the pivotal role of the non-photoabsorbing photonic backbone in facilitating effective light confinement through the photonic effect. This in turn boosts the plasmonic field for enhanced photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, even without needing additional co-catalysts. Our work offers valuable insights for future design of electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts to achieve efficient light-to-chemical transformations in diverse energy, chemical, and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Connections to the Electrodes Control the Transport Mechanism in Single&#8208;Molecule Transistors</title>

The electron&#8208;transport mechanism in a single&#8208;molecule transistor can be changed from &#8216;particle&#8208;like hopping&#8217; to &#8216;wave&#8208;like&#8217; by changing the chemical structure of the molecule&#8211;electrode interface.







Abstract
When designing a molecular electronic device for a specific function, it is necessary to control whether the charge&#8208;transport mechanism is phase&#8208;coherent transmission or particle&#8208;like hopping. Here we report a systematic study of charge transport through single zinc&#8208;porphyrin molecules embedded in graphene nanogaps to form transistors, and show that the transport mechanism depends on the chemistry of the molecule&#8211;electrode interfaces. We show that van der Waals interactions between molecular anchoring groups and graphene yield transport characteristic of Coulomb blockade with incoherent sequential hopping, whereas covalent molecule&#8211;electrode amide bonds give intermediately or strongly coupled single&#8208;molecule devices that display coherent transmission. These findings demonstrate the importance of interfacial engineering in molecular electronic circuits.

         <title>The Ferroxidase Centre of Escherichia coli Bacterioferritin Plays a Key Role in the Reductive Mobilisation of the Mineral Iron Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diiron ferroxidase centres of ferritins are required for Fe2+ oxidation and formation of the mineral core. Here, we show that the ferroxidase centres of bacterioferritin (Bfr) also play a key role in iron release, and that this is dependent on electron transfer from the Bfr heme to the ferroxidase centre.







Abstract
Ferritins are multimeric cage&#8208;forming proteins that play a crucial role in cellular iron homeostasis. All H&#8208;chain&#8208;type ferritins harbour a diiron site, the ferroxidase centre, at the centre of a 4 &#945;&#8208;helical bundle, but bacterioferritins are unique in also binding 12&#8197;hemes per 24&#8197;meric assembly. The ferroxidase centre is known to be required for the rapid oxidation of Fe2+ during deposition of an immobilised ferric mineral core within the protein's hollow interior. In contrast, the heme of bacterioferritin is required for the efficient reduction of the mineral core during iron release, but has little effect on the rate of either oxidation or mineralisation of iron. Thus, the current view is that these two cofactors function in iron uptake and release, respectively, with no functional overlap. However, rapid electron transfer between the heme and ferroxidase centre of bacterioferritin from Escherichia coli was recently demonstrated, suggesting that the two cofactors may be functionally connected. Here we report absorbance and (magnetic) circular dichroism spectroscopies, together with in vitro assays of iron&#8208;release kinetics, which demonstrate that the ferroxidase centre plays an important role in the reductive mobilisation of the bacterioferritin mineral core, which is dependent on the heme&#8208;ferroxidase centre electron transfer pathway.

         <title>Site&#8208; and Stereoselective Glycomodification of Biomolecules through Carbohydrate&#8208;Promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycomodification strategy targeting N&#8208;terminal tryptophan of biomolecules was developed using C6&#8208;oxidized glycans through a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, providing homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages. This method features high efficiency, mild conditions, robustness, biocompatibility, and applicability to a wide range of substrates, including glycans, peptides, proteins, and living&#8208;cell surfaces.







Abstract
Carbohydrates play pivotal roles in an array of essential biological processes and are consequently involved in many diseases. To meet the needs of glycobiology research, chemical enzymatic and non&#8208;enzymatic methods have been developed to generate glycoconjugates with well&#8208;defined structures. Herein, harnessing the unique properties of C6&#8208;oxidized glycans, we report a straightforward and robust strategy for site&#8208; and stereoselective glycomodification of biomolecules with N&#8208;terminal tryptophan residues by a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, which is not adapted to typical aldehyde substrates under biocompatible conditions. This method reliably delivers highly homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages and thus has great potential for functional modulation of peptides and proteins in glycobiology research. Moreover, this reaction can be performed at the glycosites of glycopeptides, glycoproteins and living&#8208;cell surfaces in a site&#8208;specific manner. Control experiments indicated that the protected &#945;&#8208;O atom of aldehyde donors and free N&#8722;H bond of the tryptamine motif are crucial for this reaction. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that the reaction exhibited a first&#8208;order dependence on both tryptophan and glycan, and deprotonation/rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Robust, Ultrafast and Reversible Photoswitching in Bulk Polymers Enabled by Octupolar Molecule Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octupolar design paradigm is introduced to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs). Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers. This together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing enables versatile uses of MOPSAs as smart inks or labels for diverse applications.







Abstract
Improving the photoswitching rate and robustness of photochromic molecules in bulk solids is paramount for practical applications but remains an on&#8208;going challenge. Here, we introduce an octupolar design paradigm to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs) featuring a C3&#8208;symmetrical A3&#8208;(D&#8208;core) architecture with a dipolar donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) photochrome in each branch. Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to enable robust ultrafast reversible photoswitching in bulk polymers. Specifically, the optimal MOPSA (4&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in commercial polyurethane films accomplishes nearly 100&#8201;% discoloration in 6&#8197;s under visible light with &#8764; 100&#8201;% thermal&#8208;recovery in 17.4&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C, while the acquired kinetics constants are 3&#8764;7&#8197;times that of dipolar DASA counterpart and 1&#8764;2&#8197;orders of magnitude higher than those of reported DASAs in polymers. Importantly, the MOPSA&#8208;doped polymer films sustain 500 discoloration/recovery cycles with slow degradation, superior to the existing DASAs in polymers (&#8804;30&#8197;cycles). We discover that multi&#8208;dipolar coupling in MOPSA enables enhanced polarization and electron delocalization, promoting the rate&#8208;determining thermal cyclization, while the branched and non&#8208;planar geometry of MOPSA induces large free volume to facilitate the isomerization. This design can be extended to develop spiropyran or azobenzene&#8208;based ultrafast photochromic films. The superior photoswitching performance of MOPSAs together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing inspires us to explore their versatile uses as smart inks or labels for time&#8208;temperature indicators, optical logic encryption and multi&#8208;levelled data encryption.

         <title>Peptide Stapling by Crosslinking Two Amines with &#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by the crosslinking of two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents has been developed. Except for Cys, all unprotected proteinogenic amino acids are tolerated. The reactivity of Arg side chains can be effectively suppressed. The use of HFIP solvent is the key to achieving high reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Inside Cover: Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of molecular vibrations on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in double helicenes DPC and DNH is reported by Tadashi Mori in a Research Article (e202319702). Specifically, in DPC (structure depicted in the picture), the study clarifies how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, and it underscores the noteworthy contribution of Herzberg&#8211;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.

An octupolar design paradigm is proposed to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, i.e., multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse adducts (MOPSAs), as reported by Dingshan Yu, Xudong Chen, Quan Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402349). Such unique design exploits multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Alkene Thianthrenation Unlocks Diverse Cation Synthons: Recent Progress and New Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of alkenes into thianthrene&#8208;derived cationic electrophiles unlocks a suite of net oxidative alkene transformations that have been elusive using conventional strategies. These linchpin intermediates can be generated selectively and undergo a diverse array of mechanistically distinct reactions with abundant nucleophiles.







Abstract
Oxidative alkene functionalization reactions are a fundamental class of complexity&#8208;building organic transformations. However, the majority of established approaches rely on electrophilic reagents that limit the diversity of groups that can be installed. Recent advances have established a new approach that instead relies on the transformation of alkenes into thianthrene&#8208;derived cationic electrophiles. These linchpin intermediates can be generated selectively and undergo a diverse array of mechanistically distinct reactions with abundant nucleophiles. Taken together, this unlocks a suite of net oxidative alkene transformations that have been elusive using conventional strategies. This Minireview describes these advances and is organized around the three distinct synthons formally accessible from alkenes via thianthrenation: 1) alkenyl cations; 2) vicinal dications; 3) allyl cations. Throughout the Minireview, we illustrate how thianthrenium salts address key limitations endemic to classic alkene&#8208;derived electrophiles and highlight the mechanistic origins of these distinctions wherever possible.

         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and influenced by numerous entangled factors. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit these interactions. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode the interactions of nanomaterials with biosystems and provides some perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.







Abstract
The interactions between biosystems and nanomaterials regulate most of their theranostic and nanomedicine applications. These nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and influenced by a number of entangled factors, including but not limited to the physicochemical features of nanomaterials, the types and characteristics of the interacting biosystems, and the properties of the surrounding microenvironments. Over the years, different experimental approaches coupled with computational modeling have revealed important insights into these interactions, although many outstanding questions remain unanswered. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and to further push the boundary of this field. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and provides our perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.

         <title>Development of Better Aptamers: Structured Library Approaches, Selection Methods, and Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers are highly structured, single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides that bind to specific targets with high affinity and selectivity. We provide a comprehensive overview of aptamer development strategies that can help facilitate their translation into real world applications, including discussions on how certain secondary structures can be used as scaffolds to build more potent aptamers for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been used to discover thousands of aptamers since its development in 1990. Aptamers are short single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides capable of binding to targets with high specificity and selectivity through structural recognition. While aptamers offer advantages over other molecular recognition elements such as their ease of production, smaller size, extended shelf&#8208;life, and lower immunogenicity, they have yet to show significant success in real&#8208;world applications. By analyzing the importance of structured library designs, reviewing different SELEX methodologies, and the effects of chemical modifications, we provide a comprehensive overview on the production of aptamers for applications in drug delivery systems, therapeutics, diagnostics, and molecular imaging.

         <dc:description>
This article discusses recent advances in developing hybrid nanomaterials for biomedicine. We highlight features and opportunities enabled by material hybridization, including the capabilities of targeting, controlled release, multiplex assay, and multi&#8208;functionality, as well as biomanufacturing. Several examples are examined to highlight the opportunities and challenges in applying this class of materials to advance biomedicine.







Abstract
Hybrid nanomaterials have found use in many biomedical applications. This article provides a comprehensive review of the principles, techniques, and recent advancements in the design and fabrication of hybrid nanomaterials for biomedicine. We begin with an introduction to the general concept of material hybridization, followed by a discussion of how this approach leads to materials with additional functionality and enhanced performance. We then highlight hybrid nanomaterials in the forms of nanostructures, nanocomposites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and biohybrids, including their fabrication methods. We also showcase the use of hybrid nanomaterials to advance biomedical engineering in the context of nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, diagnostics, theranostics, and biomanufacturing. Finally, we offer perspectives on challenges and opportunities.

         <title>Review and Theoretical Analysis of Fluorinated Radicals in Direct CAr&#8722;H Functionalization of (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct installation of fluorinated motifs onto (hetero)arenes has seen widespread application in recent years. A general strategy relies on the generation of fluorinated radicals from Functional Group Transfer Reagents. This Review highlights recent contributions in this field while discussing mechanisms and providing key DFT&#8208;based parameters and a computed reactivity scale to enhance the understanding of the chemical behaviour of these radicals.







Abstract
We highlight key contributions in the field of direct radical CAr&#8722; H (hetero)aromatic functionalization involving fluorinated radicals. A compilation of Functional Group Transfer Reagents and their diverse activation mechanisms leading to the release of radicals are discussed. The substrate scope for each radical is analyzed and classified into three categories according to the electronic properties of the substrates. Density functional theory computational analysis provides insights into the chemical reactivity of several fluorinated radicals through their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity parameters. Theoretical analysis of their reduction potentials also highlights the remarkable correlation between electrophilicity and oxidizing ability. It is also established that highly fluorinated radicals (e.g. &#8901;OCF3) are capable of engaging in single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes rather than radical addition, which is in good agreement with experimental literature data. A reactivity scale, based on activation barrier of addition of these radicals to benzene is also elaborated using the high accuracy DLPNO&#8208;(U)CCSD(T) method.

         <title>Orthogonal sp3&#8208;Ge/B Bimetallic Modules: Enantioselective Construction and Enantiospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of chiral sp3&#8208;Ge reagents for use in stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling represents a significant challenge. Herein, unprecedented enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were achieved through enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration, and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of secondary alkyl&#8208;Ge was realized in a stereospecific manner with Bpin perfectly preserved. The synthetic value of these modules highlighted the significance of Ge/B bimetallic orthogonal strategy.







Abstract
In this study, a series of enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were successfully synthesized via an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of carbagermatrane (Ge)&#8208;containing alkenes. Orthogonal cross&#8208;coupling selectivity under different Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions was achieved in an enantiospecific manner. Notably, the chiral secondary Ge exhibited a remarkable transmetallation ability prior to primary or secondary Bpin. The effectiveness of this Ge/B bimetallic strategy was further demonstrated through the development of new functional small molecules with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) performance. This represents the first successful example of synthesis of enantioenriched alkylgermanium reagents that permit enantiospecific cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalysts</title>

We pioneer the use of real&#8208;time electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrochemical processes at individual single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with single photon sensitivity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), distinguished by their maximum atom efficiency and precise control over the coordination and electronic properties of individual atoms, show great promise in electrocatalysis. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100&#8197;ms, enabling real&#8208;time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. The outcomes contribute to a fundamental understanding of SACs and pave the way for designing SACs with diverse technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Disila&#8208;carbocycles via Highly Selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the intermolecular &#963;&#8208;bond exchange reaction of two different C&#8722;Si bonds with high cross&#8208;redistribution selectivity, which serves as a ring expansion protocol to assemble diverse disila&#8208;carbocycles. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the presence of hydrogen on silicon of silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain for both of two substrates are critical to ensure the desired reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully inhibited the preferential homodimerization and C&#8722;Si/Si&#8722;H bond cross&#8208;exchange of benzosilacyclobutenes and monohydro&#8208;silacyclobutanes and achieved the first highly selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction by deliberately tuning the Ni&#8208;catalytic system, which constitutes a powerful and atom&#8208;economical ring expansion method for preparing medium&#8208;sized cyclic compounds bearing two silicon atoms at the ring junction, which are otherwise inaccessible. The DFT calculation explicitly elucidated the pivotal role of Si&#8722;H bond at silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain of two substrates in realizing the two C&#8722;Si bonds cleavage and reformation in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Lattice Strained Induced Spin Regulation in Co&#8722;N/S Coordination&#8208;Framework Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment in Co coordination polymers is regulated by compressive lattice strain to change the spin charge densities around S atoms, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with *OOH intermediates to promote the ORR performance.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT=2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) with 2&#8201;% lattice compression exhibits a superior half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin&#8208;charge densities around S atoms for Co&#8208;DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.

         <title>Simplifying Access to Targeted Protein Degraders via Nickel Electrocatalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

C&#8722;C linked glutarimide&#8208;containing structures with direct utility in the preparation of cereblon&#8208;based degraders (PROTACs, CELMoDs) can be assessed in a single step from inexpensive, commercial &#945;&#8208;bromoglutaramide through a unique Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid assisted Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic approach. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups that are historically problematic and can be applied to the simplified synthesis of dozens of known compounds that have only been procured through laborious, wasteful, multi&#8208;step sequences. The reaction is scalable in both batch and flow and features a trivial procedure wherein the most time&#8208;consuming aspect of reaction setup is weighing out the starting materials.

         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity. Herein we reported the complemental character of hypervalent bromines, as aryne precursors and their behavior under transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.







Abstract
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for the alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) to a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) prolongs its intratumoral retention and allows its continuous release for effective localized chemotherapy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) significantly outperforms free GMP and provides synergistic, potent chemoradiotherapy without causing side effects.







Abstract
Chemoradiotherapy combines radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy to potentiate antitumor activity but exacerbates toxicities and causes debilitating side effects in cancer patients. Herein, we report the use of a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) as a 2D nanoradiosensitizer and a reservoir for the slow release of chemotherapeutics to amplify the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Coordination of phosphate&#8208;containing drugs to MOL secondary building units prolongs their intratumoral retention, allowing for continuous release of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) for effective localized chemotherapy. In the meantime, the MOL sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray irradiation and provides potent radiotherapeutic effects. GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) enhances cytotoxicity by 2&#8208;fold and improves radiotherapeutic effects over free GMP in vitro. In a colon cancer model, GMP/MOL retains GMP in tumors for more than four days and, when combined with low&#8208;dose radiotherapy, inhibits tumor growth by 98&#8201;%. The synergistic chemoradiotherapy enabled by GMP/MOL shows a cure rate of 50&#8201;%, improves survival, and ameliorates cancer&#8208;proliferation histological biomarkers.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the severe accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction on Cu, S&#8208;doped Cu nanorod arrays (Cu&#8722;S NAs) were designed via an electrochemical conversion strategy. The high FE of ammonia (98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (1.4&#8201;%) can be achieved on Cu&#8722;S NAs. The introduction of S can significantly decrease the energy barrier of H2O dissociation to *H, leading to a favorable hydrogenation of *NO2 and enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia selectivity.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu&#8208;based catalysts performs a leading&#8208;edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surface is difficult and insufficient, leading to the significant generation of by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. Herein, sulphur doped Cu (Cu&#8722;S) is prepared via an electrochemical conversion strategy and used for nitrate electroreduction. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia (~98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (~1.4&#8201;%) are achieved on Cu&#8722;S, obviously superior to its counterpart of Cu (FENH3: 70.4&#8201;%, FENO2&#8722;: 18.8&#8201;%). Electrochemical in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of S doping on Cu surface can promote the kinetics of H2O dissociation to active hydrogen. The optimized hydrogen affinity validly decreases the hydrogenation kinetic energy barrier of *NO2, leading to an enhanced NH3 selectivity.

         <title>A Platform Approach to Cleavable Macrocycles for the Controlled Disassembly of Mechanically Caged Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical lock with many keys. We show that a single macrocyclic precursor can be converted to self&#8208;immolative macrocycles that open in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. Rotaxanes and catenanes based on these rings can be triggered to release their interlocked partner. This simple macrocycle platform can be used to accelerate the development of mechanically caged molecules.







Abstract
Inspired by interlocked oligonucleotides, peptides and knotted proteins, synthetic systems where a macrocycle cages a bioactive species that is &#8220;switched on&#8221; by breaking the mechanical bond have been reported. However, to date, each example uses a bespoke chemical design. Here we present a platform approach to mechanically caged structures wherein a single macrocycle precursor is diversified at a late stage to include a range of trigger units that control ring opening in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to other classes of macrocycles suitable for rotaxane and catenane formation.

         <title>Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) reveals larger molecule number and slower dynamics of vesicles opening after vesicles are treated with stress granules (SGs), implying homotypic fusion between vesicles, confirmed by observation of multi&#8208;core vesicles with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This finding provides new insights into how neural cells regulate exocytosis under oxidative stress and how SGs promote neurodegeneration.







Abstract
An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long&#8208;lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming that SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA or protein in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double&#8208;core vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes and opening a new direction to investigations of SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Li2O2 Growth in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries through Regulating Oxygen Reduction Kinetics with Photo&#8208;Assisted Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

The concept on matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration has been proposed in this work, which provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for future battery design.







Abstract
Widely acknowledged that the capacity of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) should be strongly determined by growth behaviors of the discharge product of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that follows both coexisting surface and solution pathways. However until now, it remains still challenging to achieve dynamic modulation on Li2O2 morphologies. Herein, the photo&#8208;responsive Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced oxide graphene (Au/rGO) have been utilized as cathode to manipulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by aid of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects. Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li+ concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.

Abstract
We report the triply selective and sequential diversification of a single Csp3 carbon carrying Cl, Bpin and GeEt3 for the modular and programmable construction of sp3&#8208;rich molecules. Various functionalizations of Csp3&#8722;Cl and Csp3&#8722;BPin (e.g. alkylation, arylation, homologation, amination, hydroxylation) were tolerated by the Csp3&#8722;GeEt3 group. Moreover, the methodological repertoire of alkyl germane functionalization was significantly expanded beyond the hitherto known Giese addition and arylation to alkynylation, alkenylation, cyanation, halogenation, azidation, C&#8722;S bond formation as well as the first demonstration of stereo&#8208;selective functionalization of a Csp3&#8208;[Ge] bond.

         <title>Double 1,2&#8208;Carbon Migration at Mixed Heavier Sn=Ge Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene to the germastannenylidene. Theoretical studies reveal that the isomerization process involves stepwise carboranyl group and aryl group migration. The reactivity studies demonstrate that the stannagermenylidene undergoes intriguing electron redistribution to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct upon treatment with IMe4 and readily reacts with (AlCp*)4 to give the unique heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;migration is one recurring isomerization reaction in organic chemistry. In contrast, double 1,2&#8208;migration remains rare and limited to transition&#8208;metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of mixed heavier Sn=Ge vinylidenes. Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene (3) to the germastannenylidene (4). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations revealed that 3 and 4 feature a Sn=Ge double bond. The reaction of 3 with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) results in the electron redistribution in the Sn=Ge core to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct (5). Moreover, treatment of 3 with 0.25&#8197;equiv. of (AlCp*)4 produces the heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne (6).

         <title>Topologically Tunable Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Modulating Conductivity and Chemiresistive Properties for NH3 Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are formed by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophene rings into their frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The conductivity can be modulated by adjusting the solvent system, thus regulating the dimensions and topologies of the cMOFs. 1D Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 can be easily processed into thin membranes. The 2D kgm&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 has an excellent response toward NH3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems through ring&#8208;closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 102&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100&#8197;ppm NH3 at room temperature. This work not only provides valuable insights into the design of functional cMOFs with different topologies but also enriches the cMOF family with exceptional conductivity properties.

         <title>A Novel Homoconjugated Propellane Triimide: Synthesis, Structural Analyses, and Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel homoconjugated propellane comprising three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane, has been synthesized and characterized. This rigid propellane triimide is featured with large bathochromic shift, intense luminescence, amplified molar absorptivity, and lower reduction potential relative to the subunits. The propellane triimide readily crystallizes into porous 3D superstructure, which is promising for C2H6/C2H4 separation.







Abstract
Rigid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polycyclic propellanes have garnered interest due to their unique conformational spaces, which display great potential use in selectivity, separation and as models to study through&#8208;space electronic interactions. Herein we report the synthesis of a novel rigid propellane, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane triimide, which comprises three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane. This propellane triimide exhibits large bathochromic shift, amplified molar absorptivity, enhanced fluorescence, and lower reduction potential when compared to the subunits. Computational and experimental studies reveal that the effective through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;orbitals interacting (homoconjugation) occurs between the subunits. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis reveals that the propellane triimide has a highly quasi&#8208;D3h symmetric skeleton and readily crystallizes into different superstructures by changing alkyl chains at the imide positions. In particular, the porous 3D superstructure with S&#8208;shaped channels is promising for taking up ethane (C2H6) with very good selectivity over ethylene (C2H4), which can purify C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 in a single separation step. This work showcases a new class of rare 3D polycyclic propellane with intriguing electronic and supramolecular properties.

         <title>Synthesis of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Nanosheets with Tunable Silanol Nest Contents across an Ultra&#8208;wide pH Range and Their Catalytic Validation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite synthesis under acidic conditions has always presented a challenge. In this study, we successfully prepared series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X) over a broad pH range (4 to 13) without the need for additional supplements. This achievement was realized through aggregation crystallization of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite subcrystal (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC) with highly short&#8208;range ordering and ultrasmall size extracted from the synthetic system of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC was investigated, revealing its non&#8208;classical crystallization process under mildly alkaline and acidic conditions (pH &lt; 10), and the combination of classical and non&#8208;classical processes under strongly alkaline conditions (pH &#8805; 10). What's particularly intriguing is that, the silanol nest content in the resultant Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X samples appears to be dependent on the pH values during the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC crystallization process rather than its crystallinity. Finally, the results of the furfuryl alcohol etherification reaction demonstrate that reducing the concentration of silanol nests significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X zeolite. The ability to synthesize zeolite in neutral and acidic environments without the additional mineralizing agents not only broadens the current view of traditional zeolite synthesis but also provides a new approach to control the silanol nest content of zeolite catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure Corral[4]BINOLs as Ultrastrong Receptors for Recognition and Differential Sensing of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise recognition and sensing of steroids, a type of vital biomolecules, hold immense practical value across various domains. In this study, we introduced corral[4]BINOLs (C[4]BINOLs), a pair of enantiomeric conjugated deep&#8208;cavity hosts, as novel synthetic receptors for binding steroids. Due to the strong hydrophobic effect of their deep nonpolar, chiral cavities, the two enantiomers of C[4]BINOLs demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012 M&#8722;1) for 16 important steroidal compounds as well as good enantioselectiviy (up to 15.5) in aqueous solutions, establishing them as the most potent known steroid receptors. Harnessing their ultrahigh affinity, remarkable enantioselectivity, and fluorescence emission properties, the two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids at low concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8211;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Taylor&#8208;dispersion induced phase separation for efficient characterisation of protein condensate formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nano&#8208;liters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF&#8208;based Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self&#8208;sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity. By scanning different polymer pairs, a rank of MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility from high to low can be obtained. Moreover, based on this ranking, it was also found that a highly compatible MOF&#8208;polymer pair suggested by this method also corresponds to a more predictable MMM gas separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Approach Toward the C4&#8208;Selective Amination of Pyridines via Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is highly desirable in streamlined synthesis. In this context, direct amination of pyridines stands as an important synthetic methodology, with particular emphasis on accessing 4&#8208;aminopyridines, a versatile pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a reaction manifold for the C4&#8208;selective amination of pyridines by employing nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH). Through 4&#8208;pyridyl pyridinium salt intermediates, 4&#8208;aminopyridine products are obtained in reaction with aqueous ammonia without intermediate isolation. The notable regioselectivity was achieved by the electronic tuning of the external pyridine reagents along with maximization of polarizability in the proton elimination stage. Further mechanistic investigations provided a guiding principle for the selective C&#8211;H pyridination of additional N&#8208;heteroarenes, presenting a strategic avenue for installation of diverse functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Boryl Radical as a Catalyst in Enabling Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cascade Radical Cyclization Reactions: Construction of Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade radical cyclization constitutes an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route for rapid assembly of polycyclic molecular skeletons. Although an array of redox&#8208;active metal catalysts has recently shown robust applications in enabling various catalytic cascade radical processes, the use of free organic radical as the catalyst, which is capable of triggering strategically distinct cascades, has rarely been developed. Here, we disclosed that the benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical is capable of catalyzing cascade cyclization reactions in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular pathways, assembling [5,5] fused bicyclic and [6,6,6] fused tricyclic molecules, respectively. The catalytic reactions start with the chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of the boryl radical catalyst to a tethered alkene or alkyne moiety, followed by either an intramolecular formal [3+2] or an intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process to construct bicyclo[3.3.0]octane or tetrahydrophenanthridine skeletons, respectively. Eventually, a &#946;&#8208;elimination occurs to release the boryl radical catalyst, completing a catalytic cycle. High to excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved in both catalytic reactions under substrate control.</dc:description>

         <title>Oversaturating Liquid Interfaces with Nanoparticle&#8208;Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assemblies of nanoparticles at liquid interfaces hold promise as dynamic &#8220;active&#8221; systems when there are convenient methods to drive the system out of equilibrium via crowding. To this end, we show that oversaturated assemblies of charged nanoparticles can be realized and held in that state with an external electric field. Upon removal of the field, strong interparticle repulsive forces cause a high in&#8208;plane electrostatic pressure that is released in an explosive emulsification. We quantify the packing of the assembly as it is driven into the oversaturated state under an applied electric field. Physiochemical conditions substantially affect the intensity of the induced explosive emulsification, underscoring the crucial role of interparticle electrostatic repulsion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Beyond 900 nm from Stable Radicals in Nonconjugated Poly(diphenylmethane)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic radicals with narrow energy gaps are highly sought&#8208;after for the production of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores. However, the current repertoire of developed organic radicals is notably limited, facing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by achieving stable radicals in nonconjugated poly(diphenylmethane) (PDPM). Notably, PDPM exhibits a well&#8208;balanced structural flexibility and rigidity, resulting in a robust intra&#8208;/inter&#8208;chain through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC). The stable radicals within PDPM, coupled with strong TSC, yield a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum emission spanning from blue to NIR beyond 900 nm. This extensive tunability is achieved through careful adjustments of concentration and excitation wavelength. The findings highlight the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals and introduce a novel approach for developing nonconjugated NIR emitters based on triphenylmethane subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Buffer Chain Model for Understanding Crystallization Competition in Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to comprehensively understand the packing models of conjugated polymers, in which side chains play extremely critical roles. The side chains are typically flexible and non&#8208;conductive and are widely used to improve the polymer solubility in organic solutions. Herein, a buffer chain model is proposed to describe link between conjugated backbone and side chains for understanding the relationship of crystallization competition of conductive conjugated backbones and non&#8208;conductive side chains. A longer buffer chain is beneficial for alleviating such crystallization competition and further promoting the spontaneous packing of conjugated backbones, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties. Our results provide a novel concept for designing conjugated polymers towards ordered organization and enhanced electronic properties and highlight the importance of balancing the competitive interactions between different parts of conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. While great strides have been made in our fundamental understanding of bottlebrush polymers and networks, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for the field to accelerate advancements. This perspective aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application (LengthScale), enabling bottlebrush physics to be more approachable. We conclude by addressing several topical issues and asking a series of pointed questions to stimulate conversation within the community.</dc:description>

         <title>CO intermediate&#8208;assisted dynamic Cu sintering during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu&#8208;based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu&#8208;based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8208;activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant&#8208;potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8208;(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu&#8208;based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Nanometer&#8208;Sized Pt Catalysts with an Additional Photothermy Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise ~1&#8208;nm Pt nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) with ambient stability are important in fundamental research and exhibit diverse practical applications (catalysis, biomedicine, etc.). However, synthesizing such materials is challenging. Herein, by employing the  mixture ligand protecting strategy, we successfully synthesized the largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected (~1&#8208;nm) Pt23 NCs precisely characterized with mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Interestingly, natural population analysis and Bader charge calculation indicate an alternate, varying charge &#8208;layer distribution in the sandwich&#8208;like Pt23 NC kernel. Pt23 NCs can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions without requiring calcination and other treatments, and the resulting specific and mass activities without further treatment are sevenfold and eightfold higher than those observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Density functional theory and d&#8208;band center calculations interpret the high activity. Furthermore, Pt23 NCs exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of 68.4% under 532&#8208;nm laser irradiation and can be used at least for six cycles, thus demonstrating great potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Recoverable Multimodal Force Sensors Based on Trap State and Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing that combines intensity, location, area and the like could gather a wealth of information from mechanical stimuli. Developing materials with force&#8208;induced optical and electrical dual responses would provide unique opportunities to multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing, with electrical signals quantifying the force amplitude and the luminescence output providing spatial distribution of force. However, the reliance on external power supply and high&#8208;energy excitation source brings significant challenges to the applicability of multi&#8208;dimensional force sensors. Here we reported the mechanical energy&#8208;driven and sunlight&#8208;activated materials with force&#8208;induced dual responses, and investigated the underlying mechanisms of self&#8208;sustainable force sensing. Theoretical analysis and experimental data unraveled that trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer play a major role in force&#8208;induced optical and electrical output. These materials were manufactured into pressure sensor with renewable dual&#8208;mode output for quantifying and visualization of pressures by electrical and optical output, respectively, without power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. The quantification of tactile sensation and stimuli localization of mice highlighted the multi&#8208;dimensional sensing ability of the sensor. Overall, this self&#8208;powered pressure sensor with multimodal output provides more modalities of force sensing, poised to change the way that intelligent devices sense with the world.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Spin Gates of Transition Metal Oxides via Strain Stimuli to Augment Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are key in electrochemical energy storage, offering cost&#8208;effectiveness and a broad potential window. However, their full potential is limited by poor understanding of their slow reaction kinetics and stability issues. This study diverges from conventional complex nano&#8208;structuring, concentrating instead on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin&#8208;dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin&#8208;dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these 'spin gates' occurs during a transition from a symmetric low&#8208;spin state to an asymmetric high&#8208;spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin&#8208;rearranged Al&#8208;Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371 F g&#8208;1, which is 38% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Ultraselective and Highly Permeable Fully Aromatic Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membranes are important in the pharmaceutical industry for the separation of antibiotics and salts. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by limited control of the membrane microstructure (pore architecture and free&#8208;volume elements), separation threshold, scalability, and operational stability. In this study, 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB) as prepared as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes (TFCMs) via interfacial polymerization. The relatively large molecular size and rigid molecular structure of MTLB, along with its non&#8208;coplanar and distorted conformation, produced thin and defect&#8208;free selective layers (~27 nm) with ideal microporosities for antibiotic desalination. These structural advantages yielded an unprecedented high performance with a water permeance of 45.2 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1 and efficient antibiotic desalination (NaCl/adriamycin selectivity of 422). We demonstrated the feasibility of the industrial scaling of the membrane into a spiral&#8208;wound module (with an effective area of 2.0 m2). This module exhibited long&#8208;term stability and performance that surpassed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes used for antibiotic desalination. This study provides a scientific reference for the development of high&#8208;performance TFCMs for water purification and desalination in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N&#8208;Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen&#8208;containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3&#8208; and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37 mmol&#65381;g&#8208;1&#65381;h&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88% at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in&#8208;situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Computational Pipeline for Accurate Prioritization of Protein&#8208;Protein Binding Candidates in High&#8208;Throughput Protein Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IIdentifying the interactome for a protein of interest is challenging due to the large number of possible binders. High&#8208;throughput experimental approaches narrow down possible binding partners but often include false positives. Furthermore, they provide no information about what the binding region is (e.g., the binding epitope). We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competition Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull&#8208;down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide&#8208;protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF&#8208;CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method's speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Organic Terminal 2D Ti3C2T x  MXene Nanosheets by Etching of Ti3AlC2 in an Organic Lewis Acid Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface and interface chemistry are critical for controlling the properties of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes). Numerous efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands; however, few etching methods have been reported on the direct bonding of organic groups to MXene surfaces. In this work, we demonstrated an efficient and rapid strategy for the direct synthesis of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with organic terminal groups in an organic Lewis acid (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) solvent, without introducing additional intercalations. The dissolution of aluminum and the subsequent in&#8208;situ introduction of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in the extraction of Ti3C2Tx MXene (T = CF3SO3&#8722;) (denoted as CF3SO3H&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) flakes with sizes reaching 15 &#181;m and high productivity (over 70%) of monolayers or few layers. More importantly, the large CF3SO3H&#8208;Ti3C2TxMXene nanosheets had high colloidal stability, making them promising as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Mesoporosity in Type III Porous Liquids through Dual&#8208;layer Surface Weaving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental limitation for pore preservation in a Type III porous liquid (T3PL) is the need for a small aperture from the porous filler to realize size exclusion of a bulky solvent. We present a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy that can disregard this limitation and achieve micro&#8208; and mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based T3PLs even with apertures much larger than the solvent molecules. By first weaving a tight network of poly(tert&#8208;butyl methacrylate) on the MOF surface, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) solvent can be effectively excluded from the pores while smaller guest molecules such as CO2, C2H4, and H2O can freely access the interior, as confirmed by low&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherms. Further application of a PDMS&#8208;containing polymer coating helps lower the viscosity of the PL due to increased particle dispersibility. This strategy has resulted in the successful construction of T3PLs with aperture sizes up to 3.1 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Recycling Valuable Alkylbenzenes from Polystyrene through Methanol&#8208;Assisted Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast bulk of polystyrene (PS), a major type of plastic polymers,&#160;ends up in landfills, which takes up to thousands of years to decompose in nature. Chemical recycling promises to enable lower&#8208;energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional incineration and mechanical recycling. Herein, we demonstrated that methanol as a hydrogen supplier assisted the depolymerization&#160;of PS&#160;(denoted as PS&#8208;MAD) into alkylbenzenes&#160;over a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2 wt% of virgin PS at 280 oC for 6 h&#160;with&#160;the production rate of 118.1 mmolcarbon&#160;gcatal.&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. The major components were valuable alkylbenzenes (monocyclic aromatics and diphenyl alkanes), the sum of which occupied 84.3 wt% of liquid products. According to mechanistic studies,&#160;methanol decomposition dominates the hydrogen supply during PS&#8208;MAD, thereby restraining PS aromatization which generates&#160;by&#8208;products of fused polycyclic arenes and polyphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Strategies to Diversification of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally ordered soft materials that respond to complementary stimuli are susceptible to control over their spatial and temporal morphostructural configurations via intersectional or combined effects such as gating, feedback, shape&#8208;memory, or programming. In absence of general and robust design and prediction strategies for their mechanical properties, at present, combined chemical and crystal engineering approaches could provide useful guidelines to identify effectors that determine both the magnitude and time of their response. Here, we capitalize on the purported ability of soft intermolecular interactions to instigate mechanical compliance by using halogenation to elicit both mechanical and photochemical activity of organic crystals. Starting from (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, whose crystals are brittle and photoinert, we use double and quadruple halogenation to introduce halogen&#8208;bonded planes that become interfaces for molecular gliding, rendering the material mechanically and photochemically plastic. Fluorination diversifies the mechanical effects further, and crystals of the tetrafluoro derivative are also elastic but also motile, displaying the rare photosalient effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive&#160;and Robust&#160;Vitrimers Fabricated by Synergy of Traditional and Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers offer a unique combination of mechanical performance, reprocessability, and recyclability that makes them highly promising for a wide range of applications. However, achieving dynamic behavior in vitrimeric materials at their intended usage temperatures, thus combining reprocessability with adaptivity through associative dynamic covalent bonds, represents an attractive but formidable objective. Herein, we couple boron&#8211;nitrogen&#160;(B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8211;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8722;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs with B&#8722;N dative bonds showcase enhanced mechanical performance. The excellent mechanical properties come from the synergistic effect of the dative B&#8722;N supramolecular polymer and covalent boron&#8210;ester networks.&#160;Moreover, benefiting from the associative exchange of B&#8722;O dynamic covalent bonds above their topological freezing temperature (Tv), the resultant BNVs also possess the processability. This study leveraged the structural characteristics of a boron&#8208;based vitrimer to achieve material reinforcement and toughness enhancement, simultaneously providing novel design concepts for the construction of new vitrimeric materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We here report a highly stereoselective method for the synthesis of polysubstituted conjugated dienes from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynyl ketones and pyrazole&#8208;substituted unsymmetric aminals under mild conditions, which was driven by photo and involved 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate and quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements, was successfully developed. In this transformation, the cleavage of four bonds and the recombination of five bonds were achieved in one operational step. This protocol also provided a modular tool for constructing dienes via &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy from the three components of amines, pyrazol and &#945;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. The mechanistic investigation combining control experiments and therotical calculations indicated that the plausible reaction path underwent the 1,6&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate instead of the 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach in sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating photophysical properties of TABs in red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, endowing a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display distinct red&#8208;shift in absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and enhancing charge transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.</dc:description>

Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron-deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display distinct red-shift in absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO-LUMO gap and enhancing charge transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating photophysical properties of solid-state films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
