      <title>Caught in the Hinact: Crystal Structure and Spectroscopy Reveal a Sulfur Bound to the Active Site of an O2&#8208;stable State of [FeFe] Hydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>[FeFe] hydrogenases are the most active H  2  converting catalysts in nature but their extreme oxygen sensitivity limits their use in technological applications. The [FeFe] hydrogenases from sulfate reducing bacteria can be purified in an O  2  &#8208;stable state called H  inact  . To date, the structure and mechanism of formation of H  inact  remain unknown. Our 1.65 &#197; crystal structure of this state reveals a sulfur ligand bound to the open coordination site. Furthermore, in&#8208;depth spectroscopic characterization by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS), resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, together with hybrid quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, provide detailed chemical insight into the H  inact  state and its mechanism of formation. This may facilitate the design of O  2  &#8208;stable hydrogenases and molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Ineffective OH&#8208;pinning of the flipping dynamics of a spherical guest within a tight&#8208;fitting tube</title>
      <dc:description>A supramolecular/synthetic method was devised to affix a sterically hindered substituent onto a fullerene guest encapsulated in a tubular host. A two&#8208;wheeled complex of (C  59  N)&#8211;(C  59  N) with a tubular host was oxidatively bisected to afford the C  59  N  +  &#160;cation captured in the tube. The C  59  N  +  &#160;cation in the tube was then trapped by ethanol or water, which led to an oxy substituent pinned on the guest. The guest motions within the tube were modulated by the pinned substituent, and up&#8208;and&#8208;down flipping motions were halted by an ethoxy substituent. A hydroxy substituent, however, was ineffective in halting the flipping motions despite the tight&#8208;fitting relationship between the tubular host and the spherical guest. Theoretical calculations of the dynamics revealed that the flipping motions were assisted by OH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds between the guest and the carbon&#8208;rich wall and that sliding motions of the OH group were also facilitated by deformations of the tube.</dc:description>

      <title>Glycoconjugated Metallohelices have Improved Nuclear Delivery and Suppress Tumour Growth In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Monosaccharides are added to the hydrophilic face of a self&#8208;assembled asymmetric Fe(II) metallohelix, using CuAAC chemistry. The sixteen resulting architectures are water&#8208;stable and optically pure, and exhibit improved antiproliferative selectivity against colon cancer cells (HCT116 p53  +/+  ) with respect to the non&#8208;cancerous ARPE&#8208;19 cell line. While the most selective compound is a glucose&#8208;appended enantiomer, its cellular entry is not mainly glucose transporter&#8208;mediated. Glucose conjugation nevertheless increases nuclear delivery ca 2.5&#8208;fold, and a non&#8208;destructive interaction with DNA is indicated. Addition of the glucose units affects the binding orientation of the metallohelix to naked DNA, but does not substantially alter the overall affinity. In a mouse model, the glucose conjugated compound was far better tolerated, and tumour growth delays for the parent compound (2.6 d) were improved to 4.3 d; performance as good as cisplatin but with the advantage of no weight loss in the subjects.</dc:description>

      <title>Cation&#8208;Controlled Assembly of Polyoxotungstate&#8208;Based Coordination Networks</title>
      <dc:description>We use the Preyssler polyoxoanion, [NaP5W30O110  ]14&#8722;  ({P5W30}), as a platform for evaluating the role of non&#8208;bridging cations in the formation of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;bridged polyoxometalate coordination frameworks. Specifically, we show that the assembly architecture of Co2+&#8208;bridged&#160; frameworks is dependent on the identity and amount of alkali or alkaline earth cations present during crystallization. The inclusion of Li+  , Na+  , K+  , Mg2+  or Ca2+  in the framework synthesis is used to selectively synthesize five different Co  2+&#8208;bridged {P5W30} structures. We evaluate the role of the competition between K+  and Co2+  for binding to {P5W30} in dictating framework assembly. The role of ion&#8208;pairing on framework assembly structure and available void volume is discussed. Overall, these results provide insight into factors governing the ability to achieve controlled assembly of POM&#8208;based coordination networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable Photoelectrochemical Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroarenes with Aliphatic C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroarenes are structural motifs found in many bioactive compounds and functional materials. Dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds provides straightforward access to functionalized heteroarenes from readily available materials. Established methods employ stoichiometric chemical oxidants under conditions of heating or light irradiation. By merging electrochemistry and photochemistry, we have achieved efficient photoelectrochemical dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes and C(sp3)&#8211;H donors through H2  evolution, without the addition of metal catalysts or chemical oxidants. Mechanistically, the C(sp3)&#8211;H donor is converted to a nucleophilic C&#8208;radical through H&#8208;atom transfer with chlorine atom, which is produced by light irradiation of anodically generated Cl2  from Cl&#8722;. The C&#8208;radical then undergoes radical substitution to the heteroarene to afford alkylated heteroarene products.</dc:description>

      <title>Free Radical Chemistry of Phosphasilenes</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the characteristics of radicals formed from silicon&#8208;containing heavy analogues of alkenes is of great importance for their application in radical polymerization. Bulky and electronic substituent effects in such compounds as phosphasilenes not only stabilize the Si=P double bond, but also influence the structure and species of the formed radicals. Herein we report our first investigations of radicals derived from phosphasilenes with Mes (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl), Tip (2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), Dur (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) and NMe  2  (dimethylamino) substituents on the P atom, using muon spin spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Adding muonium (a light isotope of hydrogen) to phosphasilenes reveals that: a) the electron&#8208;donor NMe  2  and the bulkiest Tip&#8208;substituted phosphasilenes form several muoniated radicals with different rotamer conformations; b) bulky Dur&#8208;substituted phosphasilene forms two radicals (Si&#8208; and P&#8208;centred); and c) Mes&#8208;substituted phosphasilene mainly forms one species of radical, at the P centre. These significant differences result from intramolecular substituent effects.</dc:description>

      <title>Reconciling Electrostatic and n&#8594;&#960;* Orbital Contributions in Carbonyl Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Attractive interactions between carbonyl groups have been studied extensively, primarily due to their prevalence in protein structure.

      <title>Nature of the Arsonium&#8208;Ylide Ph3As=CH2 and a Uranium(IV) Arsonium&#8208;Carbene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Treatment of [Ph3EMe][I] with [Na{N(SiMe3)2}] affords the ylides [Ph3E=CH2] (E = As, 1As; P, 1P). For 1As this overcomes prior difficulties in the synthesis of this classical arsonium&#8208;ylide that have historically impeded its wider study. The structure of 1As has now been determined, 45 years after it was first convincingly isolated, and compared to 1P, confirming the long&#8208;proposed hypothesis of increasing pyramidalisation of the ylide&#8208;carbon, highlighting the increasing dominance of E+&#8208;C&#8208; dipolar resonance form (sp3&#8208;C) over the E=C ene p&#8208;bonded form (sp2&#8208;C), as group 15 is descended. The uranium(IV)&#8208;cyclometallate complex [U{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2(CH2CH2SiPri2CH(Me)CH2)}] reacts with 1As and 1P by a&#8208;proton abstraction to give [U(TrenTIPS)(CHEPh3)] (TrenTIPS = N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3; E = As, 2As; P, 2P), where 2As is an unprecedented structurally characterised arsonium&#8208;carbene complex. The short U&#8208;C distances and obtuse U&#8208;C&#8208;E angles suggest significant U=C double bond character. A shorter U&#8208;C distance is found for 2As than 2P, consistent with increased uranium&#8208; and reduced pnictonium&#8208;stabilisation of the carbene as group 15 is descended, which is supported by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Prediction of CO2/N2 Selectivity in Porous Carbons from N2 Adsorption Isotherm at 77 K via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Porous carbons are an important class of porous materials with many applications including gas separation, while N  2  adsorption isotherm at 77 K is the most widely used approach to characterize porosity. Conventionally, textual properties such as surface area and pore volumes are derived from the N  2  adsorption isotherm at 77 K via fitting to an adsorption theory and then correlated to gas separation performance (uptake and selectivity). Here we use the N  2  isotherm at 77 K directly as input (representing feature descriptors for the porosity) to train convolutional neural networks that predict gas separation performance (using CO  2  /N  2  as a test case) for porous carbons more accurately. We then explore the porosity space for porous carbons for higher CO  2  /N  2  selectivity. We find that porous carbons with a bimodal pore&#8208;size distribution of well&#8208;separated mesopores (3 &#8211; 7 nm) and micropores (&lt; 2 nm) are most promising. This work will be useful in guiding experimental research of porous carbons with desired porosity for gas separation and other applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Twisted Surfaces in Mesoporous Single Crystals Deliver Enhanced Catalytic activity and Stability</title>

      <title>Quantitative assessment of tip effects in single&#8208;molecule high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy using DNA origami substrates</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM) is widely employed in the investigation of dynamic biomolecular processes at a single&#8208;molecule level. However, it remains an open and somewhat controversial question, how these processes are affected by the rapidly scanned AFM tip. While tip effects are commonly believed to be of minor importance in strongly binding systems, weaker interactions may significantly be disturbed. Here, we quantitatively assess the role of tip effects in a strongly binding system using a DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule assay. Despite its fM dissociation constant, we find that HS&#8208;AFM imaging can disrupt monodentate binding of streptavidin (SAv) to biotin (Bt) even under gentle scanning conditions. To a lesser extent, this is also observed for the much stronger bidentate SAv&#8208;Bt complex. This demonstrates the importance of a careful and quantitative evaluation of tip effects in the HS&#8208;AFM imaging also of strongly binding systems. The presented DNA origami&#8208;based assay can be universally employed to quantify tip effects in strongly and weakly binding systems and to optimize the experimental settings for their reliable HS&#8208;AFM imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>Optimization of Active Sites via Crystal Phase, Composition and Morphology for Efficient Low&#8208;Iridium Oxygen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Reducing the amount of iridium in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts without compromising their catalytic performances is one of the major requirements in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Here, with the help of theoretical studies, we show that anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions possess more active iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than IrO  2  , the benchmark OER catalyst.

However, due to their thermodynamic metastablity, anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions are generally hard to synthesize. Our additional theoretical studies demonstrate that such catalytically active anatase&#8208;type solid&#8208;solution phases can be created  in situ  on the surfaces of readily available SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid solutions during electrocatalysis in acidic solution as the solution can etch away Sr atoms. We experimentally show this with porous SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid&#8208;solution nanotubes synthesized by a facile synthetic route that comprise 56% lower iridium than IrO  2  yet show an order of magnitude higher apparent catalytic activity for OER in acidic solution.

      <title>Cross&#8208;Linked Polyphosphazene Hollow Nanosphere Derived N/P&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon with Single Nonprecious Metal Atoms for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doped polymers or carbon nanospheres have attracted a broad research interest because of their fascinating properties. However, rational synthesis of these nanospheres with controllable uniform morphologies, small particle sizes, and well&#8208;designed functionalities is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop an approach to construct cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene nanospheres with tunable hollow structures via a facile template&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. As comonomers, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene provides N and P atoms, tannic acid can coordinate with metal ions, and the replaceable third comonomer can endow the materials with various properties. After the carbonization, N/P&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres were obtained. In addition to the hollow structure, small particle size (~50 nm), and high surface area (411.60 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), atomic structural characterizations confirmed that the single atom transition metal sites (  i.e.  , Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  ) were uniformly dispersed in the carbon shell containing N and P dual coordination. The electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations revealed the superior oxygen reduction reaction performance of the obtained Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  active sites. This work provides a solution for fabricating diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing polymer nanospheres and their derived single metal atom doped carbon catalysts toward various applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heteroatom&#8208;doped polymers or carbon nanospheres have attracted a broad research interest because of their fascinating properties. However, rational synthesis of these nanospheres with controllable uniform morphologies, small particle sizes, and well&#8208;designed functionalities is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop an approach to construct cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene nanospheres with tunable hollow structures via a facile template&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. As comonomers, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene provides N and P atoms, tannic acid can coordinate with metal ions, and the replaceable third comonomer can endow the materials with various properties. After the carbonization, N/P&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres were obtained. In addition to the hollow structure, small particle size (~50 nm), and high surface area (411.60 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), atomic structural characterizations confirmed that the single atom transition metal sites (  i.e.  , Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  ) were uniformly dispersed in the carbon shell containing N and P dual coordination. The electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations revealed the superior oxygen reduction reaction performance of the obtained Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  active sites. This work provides a solution for fabricating diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing polymer nanospheres and their derived single metal atom doped carbon catalysts toward various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using Covalent Triazine Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived organic molecules transforms solar energy to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density chemical bonds, and may enable the production of industrial building&#8208;block chemicals with great economical values. Despite its great potential, photocatalytic hydrogenation remains poorly explored up to now. Existing researches are mostly based on broad bandgap inorganic semiconductors and require the assistance of noble metal based cocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of thiophene&#8208;containing covalent triazine polymer as the photocatalyst with unique donor&#8208;acceptor units, and for the first time demonstrate the metal&#8208;free photocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated organic molecules exemplified by maleic acid and furfural. Under the visible light illumination, our polymeric photocatalyst enables the transformation of maleic acid to succinic acid with an incredible production rate of ~2 mmol g  &#8208;1h  &#8208;1  , and furfural to furfuryl alcohol with a production rate of ~0.5 mmol g  &#8208;1h  &#8208;1  . Great catalyst stability and recyclability are also measured. Given the structural diversity of polymeric photocatalysts and their readily tunable optical and electronic properties, metal&#8208;free photocatalytic hydrogenation represents a highly promising approach for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Designing cost&#8208;effective and efficient electrocatalysts plays a pivotal role in advancing the development of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen generation. Herein, multifunctional active&#8208;center&#8208;transferable heterostructured electrocatalysts, platinum/lithium cobalt oxide (Pt/LiCoO2) composites with Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) anchored on LiCoO2 nanosheets, are designed towards highly efficient water splitting.

Specifically, Pt species are the active centers and LiCoO2 acts as the co&#8208;catalyst for HER, whereas the active center transfers to LiCoO2 and Pt turns into the co&#8208;catalyst for OER. The unique architecture of Pt/LiCoO2 heterostructure provides abundant interfaces with favorable electronic structure and coordination environment towards optimal adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates. The 30% Pt/LiCoO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers low overpotentials of 61 and 285 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively. This study will diversify the design strategies for the development of efficient electrocatalysts via interface engineering towards water splitting and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>New Wine in Old Bottles: Prolonging Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Crown Ethers by Supramolecular Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Traditional crown ether is injected with fresh blood of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in crystalline state. Supramolecular interactions introduced by multiple oxygen atoms and K+ were explored as a general method to tune lifetime. This work opens a new world for crown ether and its intrinsic guest responsiveness offers a new avenue for versatile smart luminescent materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular macrocyclic hosts have long been used in smart materials. However, their triplet emission and regulation at crystal level is rarely studied. Herein, ultralong and universal room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is reported for traditional crown ethers. A supramolecular strategy involving chain length adjustment and morphological locking through complexation with K+ was explored as a general method to tune the phosphorescence lifetime in the solid state. A maximum 10&#8208;fold increase of lifetime after complex formation accompanied with by invisible to visible phosphorescence was achieved. A deep encryption based on this activated RTP strategy was also facilely fabricated. This work thus opens a new world for supramolecular macrocycles and their intrinsic guest responsiveness offers a new avenue for versatile smart luminescent materials.

      <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Photodynamic Therapy for Multiple Targets: A Highly Efficient AIE&#8208;Active Photosensitizer for Selective Bacterial Elimination and Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
      <dc:description>
Millennium bug: A simple and highly efficient photosensitizer, called 4TPA&#8208;BQ, operates by aggregation&#8208;induced emission. A broad&#8208;spectrum and potent antibacterial activity was attained after incubating 4TPA&#8208;BQ with pathogens for 15&#8197;minutes. Upon lengthening of the incubation time to 12&#8197;hours, photodynamic therapy with 4TPA&#8208;BQ targeted cancer cells and presented low toxicity to normal cells.







Abstract
Pathogen infections and cancer are two major human health problems. Herein, we report the synthesis of an organic salt photosensitizer (PS), called 4TPA&#8208;BQ, by a one&#8208;step reaction. 4TPA&#8208;BQ presents aggregation&#8208;induced emission features. Owing to the aggregation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species generated and a sufficiently small &#916;EST, 4TPA&#8208;BQ shows a satisfactorily high 1O2 generation efficiency of 97.8&#8201;%. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that 4TPA&#8208;BQ exhibited potent photodynamic antibacterial performance against ampicillin&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli with good biocompatibility in a short time (15&#8197;minutes). When the incubation duration persisted long enough (12&#8197;hours), cancer cells were ablated efficiently, leaving normal cells essentially unaffected. This is the first reported time&#8208;dependent fluorescence&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy in one individual PS, which achieves ordered and multiple targeting simply by varying the external conditions. 4TPA&#8208;BQ reveals new design principles for the implementation of efficient PSs in clinical applications.

      <title>Visualization and In&#8197;Situ Ablation of Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens through Metabolic Labeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Search and destroy: A bacteria&#8208;metabolizable probe, TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala, was designed to covalently label intracellular bacteria in living host cells. Additionally, the probe can effectively ablate the labeled bacteria in&#8197;situ owing to covalent ligation to peptidoglycan, yielding a minimum inhibitory concentration of 20&#177;0.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, which is lower than that of vancomycin.







Abstract
Protected by the host cells, the hidden intracellular bacteria are typically difficult to kill by common antibiotics and cannot be visualized without complex cellular pretreatments. Herein, we successfully developed a bacteria&#8208;metabolizable dual&#8208;functional probe TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala, which is based on d&#8208;alanine and a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission for fluorescence turn&#8208;on imaging of intracellular bacteria in living host cells and photodynamic ablation in&#8197;situ. Once metabolically incorporated into bacterial peptidoglycan, the intramolecular motions of TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala are inhibited, leading to an enhanced fluorescent signal, which allows the clear visualization of the intracellular bacteria. Moreover, TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala can effectively ablate the labeled intracellular bacteria in&#8197;situ owing to covalent ligation to peptidoglycan, yielding a low intracellular minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 20&#177;0.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, much more efficient than that of a commonly used antibiotic, vancomycin.

      <title>Size and Halide Dependent Auger Recombination in Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) hold strong promise for a variety of light harvesting, emitting and detecting applications, all of which, however, could be complicated by multicarrier Auger recombination. Therefore, a complete documentation of the size and composition dependent Auger recombination rates of these NCs is highly desirable, as it can guide the system design in many applications. Here we report the synthesis and Auger measurements of monodisperse APbX  3  (A= Cs and FA; X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs in an extensive size range (~3&#8208;9 nm). The biexciton Auger lifetime of all the NCs scales linearly with the NC volume. The scaling coefficient is virtually independent of the cation but rather depends sensitively on the anion, which is 0.035, 0.085 and 0.142 ps per nm  3  for Cl, Br, and I, respectively. All of these are much faster than that in standard CdSe and PbSe NCs (~1 ps per nm  3  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Syntheses of Strychnos and Chelidonium Alkaloids via Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled Cooperative Catalysis.</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we describe enantioselective syntheses of  strychnos  and  chelidonium  alkaloids. In the first case, indole acetic acid esters were established as excellent partner nucleophiles for enantioselective cooperative isothiourea/Pd catalyzed a &#8208;alkylation. This provides products containing indole&#8208;bearing stereocenters in high yield and with excellent levels of enantioinduction in a manner that is notably independent of the  N  &#8208;substituent. This led to concise syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;akuammicine and (&#8211;)&#8208;strychnine . In the second case, the poor performance of  ortho  &#8208;substituted cinnamyl electrophiles in the enantioselective cooperative isothiourea/Ir catalyzed a &#8208;alkylation was overcome by appropriate substituent choice, leading to enantioselective syntheses of (+)&#8208;chelidonine, (+)&#8208;norchelidonine and (+)&#8208;chelamine.</dc:description>

      <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Homometallic Interface of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Nanorods and their Photothermal Therapy in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
      <dc:description>The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of plasmonic nanomaterials is highly dependent on their structures. Going beyond simple shape and size, methods of further structural modification usually involve the growth of a wetting layer on seeds, or the growth of a non&#8208;wetting island. In general, the structural tunability is still low and it hinders the exploration of plasmonic nanostructures. Here, we provide two new dimensions of synthetic controls in Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au homometallic nanohybrids: the number of the Au islands and the emerging shapes. By controlling the interfacial energy and growth kinetics, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;AuNR hybrid structures are successfully obtained, with the newly grown Au domains being sphere, polyhedron, and branched wire (nanocoral). The structural variety allowed the LSPR to be fine&#8208;tuned in full spectrum range, making them excellent candidates for plasmonic applications. Importantly, the nanocorals exhibit black&#8208;body absorption and outstanding photothermal conversion capability in NIR II window.

      <title>Rational Design of Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Three&#8208;Photon Phosphorescence Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) microscopy, three&#8208;photon excitation (3PE) microscopy has superior spatial resolution, deeper tissue penetration, and less defocused interference, and is, therefore, of great interest in the field of bioimaging. The design of suitable agents which can meet the various needs of the technology, such as large Stokes shift, good three&#8208;photon absorption (3PA), subcellular targeting, and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) properties, is a formidable challenge. In order to address this, two iridium(III) complexes (3PAIr1 and 3PAIr2) were developed as efficient three&#8208;photon phosphorescence (3PP) agents for bioimaging. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of a new group to the molecular scaffold confers a quadruple promotion in three&#8208;photon transition probability. Herein, the confocal and lifetime imaging of mitochondria as using Ir(III) complexes as 3PP agents is demonstrated for the first time. The complexes exhibit the advantages of low working concentration (50 nM), fast uptake (5 min), and low threshold for three&#8208;photon excitation power (ca. 0.5 mW at 980 nm). Moreover, the impressive tissue penetration depth achieved with these 3PA agents (ca. 450 &#181;m) allowed the 3D imaging and reconstruction of brain vasculature from a living specimen. These results indicate that the Ir(III) complexes are highly promising for medical imaging applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Stretchable perovskite solar cells with extremely recoverable performance</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising photovoltaic technology to sustainably drive stretchable applications, due to their flexible, light&#8208;weight and low&#8208;cost superiorities. However, fragility of crystals and poor crystallinity of perovskite on stretchable substrate afford an inevitable performance loss. In fact, the grain boundary defects are the Achilles&#8217; heel for the optoelectronic and mechanical degradations. Herein, we incorporate a self&#8208;healing polyurethane (s&#8208;PU) with dynamic oxime&#8722;carbamate bonds as a scaffold into the perovskite films, which simultaneously enhances crystallinity and passivates grain boundary of the perovskite films. The stretchable PSCs with s&#8208;PU deliver a stabilized efficiency of 19.15% with negligible hysteresis, which are comparable to the performance on rigid substrates. The PSCs can maintain over 90% of the initial efficiency after 3000 h under air environment because of their self&#8208;encapsulating structure. More importantly, the self&#8208;healing function of s&#8208;PU scaffold is in&#8208;situ verified. The s&#8208;PU can release the mechanical stress and repair the crack at grain boundary on multiple levels. The devices recover 88% of their original efficiency after 1000 cycles at 20% stretch. This ingenious growth strategy of crystalline semiconductors will enable a new approach for development for flexible and stretchable electronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Distannylated Bithiophene Imide: Enabling High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymer Semiconductors with an Acceptor&#8208;Acceptor Backbone</title>
      <dc:description>A distannylated electron&#8208;deficient bithiophene imide (BTI&#8208;Tin) monomer was readily synthesized and polymerized with imide&#8208;functionalized co&#8208;units via&#160;Stille coupling to afford homopolymer PBTI and copolymer P(BTI&#8208;BTI2), both featuring acceptor&#8208;acceptor backbone with high molecular weight. Benefitting from their improved electronic property and increased molecular weight, both polymers exhibited excellent unipolar n&#8208;type character in transistors with electron mobility up to 2.60 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1. When applied as acceptor materials in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, PBTI and P(BTI&#8208;BTI2) achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.67% and 8.61%, respectively. The PCE (6.67%) of polymer PBTI, synthesized from the novel distannylated monomer, is substantially higher than that (0.14%) of the same polymer PBTI*, synthesized from typical dibrominated monomer. The 8.61% PCE of copolymer P(BTI&#8208;BTI2) is also substantially higher than those (&lt; 1%) of homopolymers synthesized from dibrominated monomers.&#160;The results demonstrate the great success of BTI&#8208;Tin for facilely accessing structurally novel n&#8208;type polymers with greatly improved device performance.</dc:description>

      <title>A Highly Selective and Sensitive Chemiluminescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Hydrogen Peroxide in Cells and Animals</title>
      <dc:description>Selective and sensitive molecular probes for hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ), which plays diverse roles in oxidative stress and redox signalling, are urgently needed to investigate the physiological and pathological effects of H  2  O  2  .

By combining a specific tandem Payne/Dakin reaction with a chemiluminescent scaffold,  H  2  O  2  &#8208;CL&#8208;510  was developed as a highly selective and sensitive probe for detection of H  2  O  2  both  in vitro  and  in vivo  . A rapid 430&#8208;fold enhancement of chemiluminescence was triggered directly by H  2  O  2  without any laser excitation. Arsenic trioxide induced oxidative damage in leukemia was successfully detected.

      <title>The Impact of Aggregation on the Photophysics of Spiro&#8208;bridged Heterotriangulenes</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the impact of the central heteroatom on structural, electronic, and spectroscopic properties in a series of heterotriangulenes including a spirofluorene&#8208;bridged triphenylamine, &#8208;phosphine, and &#8208;phosphine oxide and provide a detailed study on their aggregates. The in&#8208;depth analysis of their molecular structure by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography was complemented by density functional theory calculations to shed light on the electronic structure. This analysis was particularly helpful to deconvolute the complex fluorescence spectra with contributions from the peripheral fluorenes and the respective heteroaromatic cores. Going beyond the molecular scale, we examined the aggregation behavior of these heterotriangulenes in THF/H  2  O mixtures and analyzed the amount as well as the size of the aggregates by static and dynamic light scattering. The excited&#8208;state interactions within the aggregates at high water contents were found to be similar to those found in the solid state. In addition, a plethora of morphologies and superstructures were detected by scanning electron microscopy when the dispersions were drop&#8208;casted and dried.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystals of benzamide, the first polymorphous molecular compound, are helicoidal</title>
      <dc:description>The formation of spontaneously twisted crystals is a common but poorly understood growth phenomenon. Here, we analyze the formation of twisted crystals of a metastable benzamide polymorph (form  II  ) crystallizing from highly supersaturated aqueous and ethanol solutions. Benzamide, the first polymorphic molecular crystal reported (1832), would have been the first helicoidal crystal observed had the original authors undertaken an analysis by light microscopy. Polymorphism and twisting frequently concur as they are both associated with high crystallographic driving forces. Optical and electron microscopies as well as electron and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a complex lamellar structure of benzamide form  II  needle&#8208;like crystals.

      <title>Ribbon of DNA Lattice on Gold Nanoparticles for Selective Drug Delivery to Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report on the design of a programmable DNA ribbon using long&#8208;chain DNA molecules with a user&#8208;defined repetitive padlock sequence. The DNA ribbon can be further combined with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to create a composite nanomaterial that contains an AuNP core and a high&#8208;density DNA crown carrying a cancer cell&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer, a fluorescent tag for location tracking and a cell&#8208;killing drug. This composite material can be efficiently internalized by cancer cells and its cellular location can be tracked by fluorescence imaging. The system offers several attractive characteristics, including simple design, tunable DNA crown, high drug&#8208;loading capacity, selective cell targeting and pH&#8208;sensitive drug release.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;III Absorbing and Emitting Dyes: Energy Gap Engineering of Expanded Porphyrinoids via Metallation</title>
      <dc:description>The rational synthesis of organometallic complexes of modified 26 &#960; &#8208;conjugated hexaphyrins with third near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;III) absorption and emission capabilities is described. Symmetry alteration of the frontier molecular orbitals of bis&#8208;Pd(II) and bis&#8208;Pt(II) complexes of hexaphyrin via N&#8208;confusion modification led to substantial metal d  &#960;  &#8211;p  &#960;  interactions. This MO mixing, in turn, resulted in a significantly narrower HOMO &#8211; LUMO energy gap. A remarkable long&#8208;wavelength shift of the lowest S  0  &#8208;&gt; S  1  absorption beyond 1700 nm was achieved with the bis&#8208;Pt(II) complex,  t  &#8208;Pt  2  &#8208;3  . The emergence of photoacoustic (PA) signals maximized at 1700 nm makes  t  &#8208;Pt  2  &#8208;3  &#160; potentially useful as a NIR&#8208;III PA contrast agent. The rigid bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes,  t  &#8208;Pd  2  &#8208;3  and  c  &#8208;Pd  2  &#8208;3  , are rare examples of NIR emitters beyond 1500 nm.

      <title>Synthesis of Honeycomb&#8208;Structured Beryllium Oxide via Graphene Liquid Cells</title>
      <dc:description>With the advent of layered two&#8208;dimensional crystals, surface dangling bonds&#8208;free planar sheets provide one emergent type of growth substrates to explore the new possibilities of crystal synthesis. While graphene has been widely exploited as the buffered substrate in van der Waals epitaxy, the encapsulation by two sheets can lock liquid droplets in between and more importantly, experience a van der Waals pressure up to 1 GPa, producing a miniaturized high&#8208;pressure container for the crystallization in solution.

Its practical application is, however, hampered by the capacity and voltage fade after long cycling.

Theoretical modeling reveals a recurring partially reversible LiMn  2  O  4  &#8208;like sub&#8208;nanodomain formation/dissolution process during each charge/discharge, which accumulates gradually and accounts for the Mn phase transition.

      <title>Autonomous growth of spatially localized supramolecular hydrogel through emergence of autocatalytic ability</title>
      <dc:description>Autocatalysis and self&#8208;assembly are key processes in developmental biology and are involved in the emergence of life. In the last decade both features were extensively investigated by chemists with the final goal to design synthetic living systems. Herein, we describe the autonomous growth of a self&#8208;assembled soft material, i.e. a supramolecular hydrogel, able to sustain its own formation through an autocatalytic mechanism not based on any template effect and emerging from a peptide (hydrogelator) self&#8208;assembly. A domino sequence of events starts from an enzymatically triggered peptide generation followed by their self&#8208;assembly into catalytic nanofibers inducing and amplifying their production over time, resulting in a 3D hydrogel network. A cascade is initiated by traces (10&#8208;18 M) of a trigger enzyme which can be localized allowing for a spatial resolution of this autocatalytic buildup, a sine qua none condition to fulfil on the route toward further cell mimic designs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable solution towards ammonia production but suffers poor reaction performance due to preferential catalyst&#8208;H formation and the consequential hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we electronically modify PtAu electrocatalyst d&#8208;band structure using zeolitic&#8208;imidazole framework (ZIF) to achieve a faradaic efficiency (FE) of &gt;44% with high ammonia yield rate of &gt;161 &#181;g.mg  cat  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  at ambient conditions. Our strategy lowers electrocatalyst d&#8208;band position to weaken H adsorption and concurrently creates electron deficient sites to kinetically drive NRR by promoting catalyst&#8208;N  2  interaction. The ZIF coating on electrocatalyst doubles as a hydrophobic layer to suppress HER, further improves FE by &gt;44&#8208;fold compared to without ZIF (~1%). Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies reveal PtAu&#8208;N  ZIF  interaction is key to enable strong N  2  adsorption over H atom.

      <title>Sulfur&#8208;Preloaded Double&#8208;shelled C@MoS2 Structures As an Additive Reservoir for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>The notorious growth of Li dendrites is one of the main hindrances for the practical application of the lithium metal anode (LMA). In this work,  a sulfur&#8208;preloaded hollow nanostructure based on hierarchical MoS  2  coated hollow carbon particles  (C@MoS  2  /S) was designed to modify the LMA. The C@MoS  2  hollow nanostructures serve as a good scaffold for repeated Li plating/stripping.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The notorious growth of Li dendrites is one of the main hindrances for the practical application of the lithium metal anode (LMA). In this work,  a sulfur&#8208;preloaded hollow nanostructure based on hierarchical MoS  2  coated hollow carbon particles  (C@MoS  2  /S) was designed to modify the LMA. The C@MoS  2  hollow nanostructures serve as a good scaffold for repeated Li plating/stripping. More importantly, the encapsulated sulfur could gradually release lithium polysulfides during the Li plating/stripping processes, which act as an effective additive to promote the formation of a mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer embedded with crystalline hybrid lithium&#8208;based components.

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part A. Stage Setting</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a wave breaking over us&#8212;a wave of simulation and artificial intelligence. In three reflective Essays we make a case for true understanding, for scientific story&#8208;telling, as well as a role for pleasure and the emotions within science in general and quantum chemistry in particular.







Abstract
We begin our tripartite Essay with a triangle of understanding, theory and simulation. Sketching the intimate tie between explanation and teaching, we also point to the emotional impact of understanding. As we trace the development of theory in chemistry, Dirac's characterization of what is known and what is needed for theoretical chemistry comes up, as does the role of prediction, and Thom's phrase &#8220;To predict is not to explain.&#8221; We give a typology of models, and then describe, no doubt inadequately, machine learning and neural networks. In the second part, we leave philosophy, beginning by describing Roald's being beaten by simulation. This leads us to artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens&#8217; account of what a go&#8208;playing program knows. Back to our terrain&#8212;we ask &#8220;Quantum Chemistry, &#8224; ca. 2020?&#8221; Then move to examples of AI affecting social matters, ranging from trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future a voice. But we don't do justice to that view&#8212;how could we? We return to questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. Onward: In the 3rd part of this Essay, we work our way up from pessimism. We trace (another triangle!) the special interests of experimentalists, who want the theory we love, and reliable numbers as well. We detail in our own science instances where theory gave us real joy. Two more examples&#8208;on magnetic coupling in inorganic diradicals, and the way to think about alkali metal halides, show us the way to integrate simulation with theory. Back and forth is how it should be&#8212;between painfully&#8208;obtained, intriguing numbers, begging for interpretation, in turn requiring new concepts, new models, new theoretically grounded tools of computation. Through such iterations understanding is formed. As our tripartite Essay ends, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and searchers for understanding. Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a passage to art and to perceiving, as we argue we must, the sacred in science.

      <title>Early Transition Metal Catalysis for Olefin&#8211;Polar Monomer Copolymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst design: This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations are discussed, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.







Abstract
Introducing polar functional groups into widely used polyolefins can enhance polymer surface, rheological, mixing, and other properties, potentially upgrading polyolefins for advanced, value&#8208;added applications. The metal catalyst&#8208;mediated copolymerization of non&#8208;polar olefins with polar comonomers represents the seemingly most straightforward, atom&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient approach for synthesizing polar functionalized polyolefins. However, electrophilic early transition metal (groups 3 and 4)&#8208;catalyzed processes which have achieved remarkable success in conventional olefin polymerizations, encounter severe limitations here, largely associated with the Lewis basicity of the polar co&#8208;monomers. In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.

      <dc:description>Since their prediction in 1998 , guest&#8208;induced structural transitions in 3  rd  generation porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have changed common understanding on the adsorption properties of porous solids. By 2009, the chemistry of local and global dynamic behavior in crystalline porous solids received tremendous interest, with the studies linked under soft porous crystals (SPCs) .

      <title>Methanol synthesis at a wide range of H2/CO2 ratios over Rh&#8208;In bimetallic catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in capturing hydrogen generated from renewables with CO  2  to produce methanol. However, renewable hydrogen production is currently expensive and in limited quantity as compared to CO  2  . Excess CO  2  and limited H  2  in the feedstock gas mixture is not favourable for the CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol reaction, which causes low activity and poor methanol selectivity.
