         <title>Control of Hot Carrier Relaxation in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Using Damping Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr  3  nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr  3  nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shell&#8208;like Xenon Nano&#8208;Traps within Angular Anion&#8208;Pillared Layered Porous Materials for Boosting Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) is a promising technique but remains a daunting challenge since they are atomic gases without dipole or quadruple moments. Herein we report a strategy for fabricating angular anions&#8208;pillared materials featuring shell&#8208;like Xe nano&#8208;traps, which provide a cooperative effect conferred by the pore confinement and multiple specific interactions. The perfect permanent pore channel (4~5 &#197;) of Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2  MO4  (M = Cr, Mo, W) can host Xe atoms efficiently even at ultra&#8208;low concentration (400 ppm Xe), showing the second&#8208;highest selectivity of 30.2 in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2  WO4  and the excellent Xe adsorption capacity in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2CrO4  (15.0 mmol/kg). Crystallography studies and DFT&#8208;D calculations revealed the energy favorable binding sites and angular anions enable the synergism between optimal pore size and polar porosity for boosting Xe affinity. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated three MOFs as efficient adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyyne [3]rotaxanes: Synthesis via dicobalt carbonyl complexes and enhanced stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New strategies for synthesizing polyyne polyrotaxanes are being developed as an approach to stable carbyne &#8216;insulated molecular wires&#8217;. Here we report an active metal template route to polyyne [3]rotaxanes, using dicobalt carbonyl masked alkyne equivalents. We synthesized two [3]rotaxanes, both with the same C28  &#160;polyyne dumbbell component, one with a phenanthroline&#8208;based macrocycle and one using a 2,6&#8208;pyridyl cycloparaphenylene nanohoop. The thermal stabilities of the two rotaxanes were compared with that of the naked polyyne dumbbell in decalin at 80 &#176;C, and the nanohoop rotaxane was found to be 4.5 times more stable.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Manganese&#8208;doping in CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets by Employing a Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn&#8208;doping in cesium lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is of particular importance where strong quantum confinement plays a significant role towards the exciton&#8208;dopant coupling. In this work, we report an immiscible bi&#8208;phasic strategy for post&#8208;synthetic Mn&#8208;doping of CsPbX  3  (X = Br, Cl) NPls. A systematic study shows that electron&#8208;donating oleylamine act as a shuttle ligand to transport MnX  2  through the water&#8208;hexane interface and deliver it to the NPls. The halide anion also plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn  2+  and thus fulfilling the octahedral factor required for the formation of perovskite crystals. By varying the thickness of parent NPls, we can tune the dopant incorporation and, consequently, the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process in doped NPls. Time&#8208;resolved optical measurements offer a detailed insight into the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process. This new approach for post&#8208;synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar&#8208;nonpolar interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbamoylated Guanidine&#8208;Containing Polymers for Non&#8208;Covalent Functional Protein Delivery in Serum&#8208;Containing Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the high potential of controlling cellular processes and treating various diseases by intracellularly delivered proteins, current delivery systems exhibit poor efficiency due to poor serum stability, cellular entry, and cytosolic availability of proteins. Here, we report a novel functional group, phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG), that greatly enhances the delivery efficiency to various types of cells. Owing to the substantially lowered pKa, the hydrophobic Ph&#8208;CG offers optimized inter&#8208;macromolecular interactions via enhanced hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The coplanarity of Ph&#8208;CG also leads to the better intracellular entry of protein complexes. Intracellularly delivered apoptosis&#8208;inducing enzymes and antibodies significantly induce cell viability inhibitions in a serum&#8208;containing medium. The newly developed Ph&#8208;CG can be introduced to various existing carriers, leading to the realization of future therapeutic protein delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Bispecific Peptide for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise and effective manipulation of protein functions still faces tremendous challenges. Herein we report a programmable peptide molecule, consisted of targeting and self&#8208;assembly modules, that enables specific and highly efficient assembly governed by targeting receptor proteins. Upon binding to the cell membrane receptor, peptide conformation is somewhat stabilized along with decreased self&#8208;assembly activation energy, promoting peptide&#8208;protein complex oligomerization. We first design a GNNQQNY&#8208;RGD peptide (G7&#8208;RGD) to recognize integrin &#945;  V  &#946;  3  receptor for proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. In the presence of &#945;  V  &#946;  3  protein, the critical assembly concentration of free G7&#8208;RGD decreases from 525 to 33 &#181;M and the resultant G7&#8208;RGD cluster drives integrin receptor oligomerization. Finally, a bispecific assembling peptide antiCD3&#8208;G7&#8208;RGD is rationally designed for cancer immunotherapy, which validates CD3 oligomerization and concomitant T cell activation, leading to T cell&#8208;mediated cancer cell cytolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Modification of Nano&#8208;Cu2O for Controlling CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Ethylene and Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the surroundings of carbon neutrality, nano&#8208;Cu2O is considered a promising catalyst for electrochemical CO2  reduction reaction (ECO2RR), whose improvements in product selectivity still require considerable efforts. Here, we present an efficient strategy for controlling the ECO2RR product by modifying the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O, i.e., by controlling the exposed facets via a reductant&#8208;controlled method to achieve the highest C2H4  selectivity (faradaic efficiency = 74.1%) for Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts in neutral electrolytes, and introducing a well&#8208;suited metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) coating on the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O to obtain syngas completely with an appropriate H2:CO ratio. Detailed mechanism and key intermediate have been illustrated via DFT calculations. Our systematic strategy is expected to controlling the ECO2RR product, improving the selectivity, and providing a reliable method for CO2  management and the green production of important carbon resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalizations of Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review recaps the development of selected deoxygenation methodologies for aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids, which take full advantage of the tremendous yet underexplored synthetic potential of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. Representative literature examples are discussed and their general features summarized, including characteristic reaction intermediates, typical reactivity patterns and commonly used conditions.







Abstract
The simple and efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds into functionalized alkanes via deoxygenation is highly enabling in chemical synthesis. This Review covers the recent methodology development in carbonyl and carboxyl deoxygenative functionalizations, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advances are categorized based on the reactivity patterns of some oxygenated feedstock compounds, including aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. Four types of reactive intermediates arising from aldehydes and ketones during the deoxygenation, namely, bis&#8208;electrophiles, carbenoids, bis&#8208;nucleophiles and alkyl radical equivalents, are presented, while the carboxylic acids mainly behave as tris&#8208;electrophiles when deoxygenated. In each subcategory, selected examples are organized according to the type of bond formation and discussed from a generalized mechanistic perspective.

         <title>Fold&#8208;in Synthesis of a Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of an ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged cyclic pyrrole pentamer. This circulene takes a saddle&#8208;distorted structure with bond lengths of the central ten&#8208;membered&#8208;ring in the range of 1.455&#8211;1.493 &#197;. Relatively broad absorption and fluorescence spectra were observed, which reflects its flexible structure, in accordance with the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra and theoretical calculations. The energy barrier for saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle interconversion was estimated to be quite small (~3 kcal/mol).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropenols Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Organocatalyzed [2+1] Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the synthesis of common cyclopropenes have been well studied, the access to cyclopropenols is rather limited. Herein, we report the first synthesis of &#593;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropenols via 2+1 cycloaddition reactions between alkynes and trifluoroacylsilanes, enabled by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced organocatalysis. The novel ambiphilic donor&#8208;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non&#8208;activated alkynes. The reaction is featured by the simple operation, mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by the gram scale reactions and first synthesis of &#593;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols through the combination of the 2+1 cyclization and high diastereoselective hydrogenation reaction in one pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening Heteroatom Configurations for Reversible Sloping Capacity Promises High&#8208;Power Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping has been proved to effectively enhance the sloping capacity, nevertheless, the high sloping capacity almost encounters a conflict with the disappointing initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, we propose a heteroatom configuration screening strategy by introducing a secondary carbonization process for the phosphate&#8208;treated carbons to remove the irreversible heteroatom configurations but with the reversible ones and free radicals remained, achieving a simultaneity between the high sloping capacity and ICE (~250 mAh g&#8208;1 and 80%). The Na storage mechanism was also studied based on this &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon to revealed the reason of the absence of the plateau. This work could inspire to distinguish and filter the irreversible heteroatom configurations and facilitate the future design of practical &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;performance Ca&#8208;ion Battery based on Organic Anode and Graphite Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage application. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5 m concentrated electrolyte with calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)  2  ) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion for Ca  2+  in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmental friendliness graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4 mAh g  &#8208;1  specific discharge capacity at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and 84.7% capacity retention over 350 cycles, among best results of CIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generic Rules for Distinguishing Autophoretic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano&#8208; and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self&#8208;diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self&#8208;electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano- and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self-diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self-electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Dual Single&#8208;Atom Sites on 2D Ultrathin N&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheets Attaining Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a novel dual single&#8208;atom catalyst comprising adjacent Fe&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4 sites on 2D ultrathin N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with porous structure (FeMn&#8208;DSAC) was constructed as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). FeMn&#8208;DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the augmenting catalytic activity arises from Fe&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;sites synergistic effect facilitating *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn&#8208;DSAC renders the fabricated ZAB operating efficiently at ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8208;40 &#8451;, delivering 30 mW cm&#8208;2 peak power density and retaining up to 86% specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart, representing the top&#8208;level performance among previously reported results.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Interrogation of Cellular Signaling in Live Cells using a Membrane&#8208;anchored DNA Multitasking Processor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic interrogation of correlative signaling components in their native environment is of great interest for dissecting sophisticated cellular signaling. However, it remains a challenge because of lacking versatile and effective approaches. Herein, we propose a cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for integrated analyses of cellular signal transduction. Enhanced and controllable modulation of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of DNA processors. Moreover, the multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed monitoring correlative VEGF secretion induced by c&#8208;Met activity regulation directly. By exploiting versatile aptameric nucleic acids, this modular designed DNA multitasking processor dissected how cell surface receptors coordinated with related components in live cells systematically. Therefore, it provides a powerful chemical tool for both fundamental cell biology research and precision medicine applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Metal&#8208;Nucleobase Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xe/Kr Separation is one of the industrially important but challenging processes owing to their inert properties and low concentrations in the air. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation is a promising technology. Herein, two isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;nucleobase frameworks (HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201 and HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;202) are capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions and strikes an excellent balance between capacity and selectivity. The Xe capacity of HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201a reaches 3.01 mmol/g at 298 K and 1.0 bar, while IAST selectivity and Henry's constant are 21.0 and 21.6, respectively. Direct breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, affording a Xe capacity of 25.8 mmol/kg from a Xe/Kr mixed&#8208;gas at dilute concentrations. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the selective binding arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of ZnMn2O4 Quantum Dots in Carbon Framework for Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese oxides are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high energy density and low cost. However, in their discharging processes, the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect and Mn  3+  disproportionation often lead to irreversible structural transformation and Mn  2+  dissolution, deteriorating the cycling stability of ZIBs. Herein, ZnMn  2  O  4  quantum dots (ZMO QDs) were introduced into porous carbon framework by  in&#8208;situ  electrochemically inducing Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived Mn  3  O  4  quantum dots and carbon composite. In such ZMO QDs and carbon composite, the quantum dot structure endows ZnMn  2  O  4  with shorter ion diffusion route and more active sites for Zn  2+  . The highly conductive carbon framework is beneficial to the fast transport of electrons. Furthermore, at the interface between ZMO QDs and carbon matrix, the Mn&#8208;O&#8208;C bonds are formed. They can effectively suppress Jahn&#8208;Teller effect and manganese dissolution of discharge products. Therefore, Zn/ZMO QD@C batteries display remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multiplexed Cell&#8208;Free Assay to Screen for Antimicrobial Peptides in Double Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global surge in bacterial resistance against traditional antibiotics triggered intensive research for novel compounds, with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified as a promising candidate. Automated methods to systematically generate and screen AMPs according to their membrane preference, however, are still lacking. We introduce a novel microfluidic system for the simultaneous cellfree production and screening of AMPs for their membrane specificity. On our device, AMPs are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;inwater double emulsion droplets, generated at high frequency. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different classes of coencapsulated liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The double emulsions can be incubated and observed in a hydrodynamic trapping array or analyzed via flow cytometry. Our approach provides a valuable tool for the discovery and development of membrane&#8208;active antimicrobials.</dc:description>

         <title>Deeper Insight into the Role of Organic Ammonium Cations in Reducing Surface Defects of the Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ammonium salts (OASs) have been widely used to passivate perovskite defects. The passivation mechanism is usually attributed to coordination of OASs with unpaired lead or halide ions, yet ignoring their interaction with excess PbI  2  on the perovskite film. Herein, we demonstrate that OASs not only passivate defects by themselves, but also redistribute excess aggregated PbI  2  into a discontinuous layer, augmenting its passivation effect. Moreover, alkyl OAS is more powerful to disperse PbI  2  than F&#8208;containing one, leading to better passivation and device efficiency because F atoms restrict the intercalation of OAS into PbI  2  layers. Inspired by this mechanism, exfoliated PbI  2  nanosheets are adopted to provide better dispersity of PbI  2  , further boosting the efficiency to 23.14%. Our finding offers a distinctive understanding on the role of OASs in reducing perovskite defects, and a clue to choose an OAS passivator by considering substitution effect other than by trial and error.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Serotonins for Optical Control of the 5&#8208;HT2A&#160;Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin receptors play central roles in neuromodulation and are critical drug targets for psychiatric disorders. Optical control of serotonin receptor subtypes has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of receptor function. While other neuromodulatory receptors have been successfully rendered photoswitchable, reversible photocontrol of serotonin receptors has not been achieved, representing a major gap in GPCR photopharmacology. Herein, we develop the first tools that allow for such control. Azo5HT&#8208;2 shows light&#8208;dependent 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism, with greater activity in the cis&#8208;form. Based on docking and test compound analysis, we also develop photoswitchable orthogonal, remotely&#8208;tethered ligands (PORTLs). These BG&#8208;Azo5HTs provide rapid, reversible, and repeatable optical control following conjugation to SNAP&#8208;tagged 5&#8208;HT2AR. Overall, this study provides a foundation for the broad extension of photopharmacology to the serotonin receptor family.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor Fluorescence based on Excitation&#8208;Dependent Electron Transfer Processes in o&#8208;Carborane Dyads.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;de) emission are highly attractive for anticounterfeiting, optoelectronics and bioassay applications; however, the realization of Ex&#8208;de fluorescence, independent of aggregation states, remains a challenge. We herein report a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) strategy to design Ex&#8208;de fluorescence materials by manipulating the relaxation pathways of multiple excited states. As expected, the o&#8208;carborane dyad presents a clear Ex&#8208;de fluorescence colour in the aggregated states, resulting from the tunable relative intensity of the dual&#8208;fluorescence spectra. Taking TP[1]B as an example, the amorphous powders emitted bright blue&#8208;violet, white and yellow colours under 390 nm, 365 nm and 254 nm UV illumination, respectively. Importantly, multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this o&#8208;carborane dyad are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Sensitive Logic Nanodevices with Strong Response for Weak Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive sensing is critical when developing new calculation systems with weak input signals (ISs). In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of sensitive logic nanodevices by coupling input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier. By rational design of the sequence of computing elements (CEs) so as to avoid cross&#8208;talking between ISs and signal amplifier, the newly formed logic nanodevices have good sensitivity to the weak ISs even at low concentrations of CEs, and are able to perform YES, OR, NAND, NOR, INHIBIT, INHIBIT&#8208;OR and number classifier operation, showing that the DNA calculation proceeds in dilute solution medium that greatly prompts the calculation proficiency of logic nanodevices without the confinement of lithography process in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics.  In vivo  results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Zero and Low Valent Metal Nodes Connected by Tetratopic Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with M(0) nodes are attractive targets due to the potential reactivity of these lowvalent metals, but examples of these MOFs remain exceedingly rare. The rational design of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs with Pd(0) and Pt(0) nodes using tetratopic phosphine ligands is reported. Five new MOFs have been synthesized by systematic variation of the phosphine ligands and metal precursors employed, and these represent the first examples of MOFs constructed using phosphine&#8208;metal bonds as the only structural component. The MOFs display solid&#8208;state luminescence, with emission maxima that are significantly red&#8208;shifted compared to Pd(PPh  3  )  4  . In addition, a Rh(I) low valent coordination solid based on the same linker design is reported, which displays solid&#8208;state luminescence that is not observed for the molecular analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Transformation of PET and CO2 into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CO2, two chemical wastes that urgently need to be transformed in the environment, are converted simultaneously in a one&#8208;pot catalytic process through the synergistic coupling of three reactions: CO2 hydrogenation, PET methanolysis and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) hydrogenation. More interestingly, the chemicals equilibria of both reactions were shifted forward due to a revealed dual&#8208;promotion effect, leading to significantly enhanced PET depolymerization. The overall methanol yield from CO2 hydrogenation exceeded the original thermodynamic equilibrium limit since the methanol was in&#8208;situ consumed in PET methanolysis. The degradation of PET by a stoichiometric ratio of methanol was significantly enhanced because the primary product, DMT was hydrogenated to dimethyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DMCD) or p&#8208;xylene (PX). This synergistic catalytic process provides an effective way to simultaneously recycle two wastes, polyesters and CO2, for producing high&#8208;value chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific functionalization of recombinant spider silk Janus fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biotechnological production is a powerful tool to design materials with customized properties. The aim of this work was to apply designed spider silk proteins to produce Janus fibers with two different functional sides. First, functionalization was established through a cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein, ntagCyseADF4(k16). After fiber spinning, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coupled via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry. Significantly reduced electrical resistivity indicated sufficient loading density of AuNPs on such fiber surfaces. Then, Janus fibers were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement, with &#8220;non&#8208;functional&#8221; eADF4(C16) on the one and &#8220;functional&#8221; ntagCyseADF4(k16) on the other side. Post&#8208;treatment was established to render silk fibers insoluble in water. Subsequent AuNP binding was highly selective on the ntagCyseADF4(k16) side demonstrating the potential of such silk&#8208;based systems to realize complex bifunctional structures with spatial resolutions in the nano scale.</dc:description>

Then, Janus fibers were electrospun in a side-by-side arrangement, with &#8220;non-functional&#8221; eADF4(C16) on the one and &#8220;functional&#8221; ntagCyseADF4(k16) on the other side. Post-treatment was established to render silk fibers insoluble in water. Subsequent AuNP binding was highly selective on the ntagCyseADF4(k16) side demonstrating the potential of such silk-based systems to realize complex bifunctional structures with spatial resolutions in the nano scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cholesterol Dimer Stabilizes the Inactivated State of an Inward&#8208;rectifier Potassium Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesterol oligomers reside in multiple membrane protein X&#8208;ray crystal structures. Yet, there is no direct link between these oligomers and a biological function. Here we present the structural and functional details of a cholesterol dimer that stabilizes the inactivated state of an inward&#8208;rectifier potassium channel KirBac1.1. K  +  efflux assays confirm that high cholesterol concentration reduces K  +  conductance. We then determine the structure of the cholesterol&#8208;KirBac1.1 complex using Xplor&#8208;NIH simulated annealing calculations driven by solid&#8208;state NMR distance measurements. These calculations identified an a&#8211;a cholesterol dimer docked to a cleft formed by adjacent subunits of the homotetrameric protein. We compare these results to coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations. This is one of the first examples of a cholesterol oligomer performing a distinct biological function and structural characterization of a conserved promiscuous lipid binding region.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close&#8208;packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring&#8208;flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self&#8208;assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC&#8208;surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self&#8208;assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on the Directing Ability of Chalcogenoethers in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective C&#8211;H Olefination and Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein our experimental and DFT computational studies on the directing ability of chalcogenoether motifs in Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H functionalization. Thioether motif was found to be a superior directing group compared to the corresponding ether and selenoether in terms of reactivity and enantiocontrol. Remarkably, DFT calculation provided a predictive model for the optimization of reaction conditions and the interpretation of the origin of enantioselectivity. Both Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8211;H olefination and allylation reactions were successfully developed using chiral phosphoric acids as efficient ligands, providing a broad range of axially chiral biaryls in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of polyaryls bearing multiple stereogenic axes, gram&#8208;scale reaction and various chemical transformations make this protocol more attractive and significant.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient and selective photocatalytic CO  2  reduction was obtained within a hybrid system that is formed in situ via a Schiff base condensation between a molecular iron quaterpyridine complex bearing an aldehyde function and carbon nitride. Irradiation (blue LED) of an CH  3  CN solution containing 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), triethylamine (TEA), Feqpy&#8208;BA (qpy&#8208;BA = 4&#8208;([2,2':6',2'':6'',2'''&#8208;quaterpyridin]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzaldehyde) and C  3  N  4  resulted in CO evolution with a turnover number of 2554 and 95% selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of lithium metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume expansion on the metal anodes. Inspired by the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; concept in data mining, here we utilize a conductive polymer&#8208;filled metal organic framework (MOF) as the lithium host, in which polypyrrole (PPy) serves as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to interlink Li &#8220;blocks&#8221; stored in the MOF pores. While the N&#8208;rich PPy guides fast Li  +  infiltration/extrusion and serves as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li growth, the MOF pores compartmentalize bulk Li deposition for 3D matrix Li storage, lending low&#8208;barrier and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping with superb Coulombic efficiency. The as&#8208;fabricated lithium metal anodes operate over 700 cycles at 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  in symmetric cells, and 800 cycles at 1 C in full cells with a per&#8208;cycle capacity loss of only 0.017%. This work might open a new chapter for Li metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.</dc:description>

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network with Distinctive Topology Transformations for Shape&#8208; and Molecular Architecture Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond exchange in a typical dynamic covalent polymer network allows access to macroscopic shape reconfigurability, but the network architecture is not altered. An opposite possibility is that the network architecture can be designed to switch to various topological states corresponding to different material properties. Achieving both in one network can expand the material scope, but their intrinsically conflicting mechanisms make it challenging. We design a dynamic covalent network that can undergo two orthogonal topological transformations, namely transesterification on the branched chains and olefin metathesis on the mainframe. This allows independent control of the macroscopic shape and molecular architecture. With this design, we illustrate a bottlebrush network with programmable shape and spatially definable mechanical properties. Our strategy paves a way to on&#8208;demand regulation of network polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Indomethacin Polymorph &#948; Revealed To Be Two Plastically Bendable Crystal Forms by 3D Electron Diffraction: Correcting a 47&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Misunderstanding**

         <dc:description>
The structures of the third polymorph of indomethacin, Form &#948;, crystallized from both melt and solution are reported. The two crystallization methods were believed to produce the same polymorph since its discovery in 1974. Through combining microdroplet melt crystallization with 3D electron diffraction, we reveal that the two crystallization methods produce two different polymorphs and correct this 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding.







Abstract
Indomethacin is a clinically classical non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;&#8208;indomethacin cannot be cultivated as large single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;&#8208;indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt&#8208;crystallized and solution&#8208;crystallized &#948;&#8208;indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs. This discovery and correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that 3D electron diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.

&lt;p&gt;Indomethacin is a clinically classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;-indomethacin cannot be cultivated as large single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;-indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt-crystallized and solution-crystallized &#948;-indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution-crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt-crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs.

         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective  N  &#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 arylation of indole has been sought after to achieve because of the prevalent application of arylindoles and the intricate reactivities led by multiple sites of  N  &#8208;unsubstituted indole. Represented herein is the first regioselective heteroarylation of indole via radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling by visible light irradiation. Steady and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic and computational studies revealed that the hydrogen bonding interaction of organic base and its conjugated acid, respective with indole and heteroarylnitrile, determined the reaction pathway, which underwent either proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer or energy&#8208;transfer for the subsequent radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling, leading to the regioselective formation of C&#8208;3 and  N  &#8208;1 heteroarylation of indoles, respectively. The parallel methodologies for regioisomeric  N  &#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 heteroaryl indoles with good functional group compatibility could be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of bioactive compounds under extremely mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Networks Enable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl&#8208;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic chemists have learned to mimic nature in using hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions to dictate the spatial arrangement of reaction substrates and to stabilize transition states to enable highly efficient and selective reactions. The activation of a catalyst molecule itself by hydrogen bonding networks, in order to enhance its catalytic activity to achieve a desired reaction outcome, is less explored in organic synthesis, despite being a commonly found phenomenon in nature. Herein, we show our investigation into this underexplored area by studying the promotion of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by hydrogen bonding&#8208;assisted Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in combination with  para  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA). Our experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal not only an interesting role of HFIP solvent in assisting pTSA Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, but also insightful knowledge about the current limitations of the carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Sulfate Optical Materials Exhibiting Giant Second Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovering novel sulfate optical materials with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and large birefringence is confronted with a great challenge attributed to the intrinsically weak polarizability and optical anisotropy of tetrahedral SO4 groups. Herein, two superior&#8208;performing sulfate optical materials, namely, noncentrosymmetric Hg3O2SO4 and centrosymmetric CsHgClSO4&#183;H2O, have been successfully synthesized through the introduction of a highly polarizable d10 metal cation, Hg2+. The unique component layers in the reported compounds, [Hg3O2SO4]&#8734; layers in Hg3O2SO4 and [HgClSO4(H2O)] [[EQUATION]]  layers in CsHgClSO4&#183;H2O, induce enlarged birefringence in each sulfate. Remarkably, Hg3O2SO4 exhibits a very large SHG response of 14.0 times that of KH2PO4, which is the strongest efficiency among all the reported nonlinear optical sulfates. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the employment of highly polarizable Hg2+ is an effective strategy to design superior optical materials with large birefringence and strong SHG response.</dc:description>

Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the employment of highly polarizable Hg2+ is an effective strategy to design superior optical materials with large birefringence and strong SHG response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lessons from an Array: Using An Electrode Surface to Control The Selectivity of a Solution Phase Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemistry offers a variety of novel means by which selectivity can be introduced into synthetic organic transformations. In the work reported, it is shown how methods used to confine chemical reactions to specific sites on a microelectrode array can also be used to confine a preparative reaction to the surface of an electrode inserted into a bulk reaction solution. In so doing, the surface of a modified electrode can be used to introduce new selectivity into a preparative reaction that is not observed in the absence of either the modified electrode surface or the effort to confine the reaction to that surface. The observed selectivity can be optimized in the same way that confinement is optimized on an array and is dependent on the nature of the functionalized surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered 2D Halide Perovskites beyond the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Phase: Tailored Interlayer Chemistries for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) phases are two emerging types of layered 2D halide perovskites with high potential in balanced charge&#8208;transport properties and chemical stability. By tailoring the molecular, thin&#8208;film, and device chemistries, high&#8208;performance solar cells have been demonstrated.







Abstract
Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) with crystallographically 2D structures have gained increasing interest for photovoltaic applications due to their superior chemical stability and intriguing anisotropic properties, which are in contrast to their conventional 3D perovskite counterparts. The most frequently studied LHPs are Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) phases, which suffer from a carrier&#8208;transport bottleneck due to the van der Waals gap associated with their intrinsic organic interlayer structures. To address this issue, Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) LHPs have rapidly emerged, which exhibit unique structural and (opto)electronic characteristics that may resemble those of the 3D counterparts owing to the eliminated or reduced van der Waals gap. Improved photophysical properties have been achieved in DJ and ACI LHPs, leading towards better photovoltaic performance. Here we provide a comprehensive discussion on the merits and promises of DJ and ACI LHPs from a chemistry perspective. Then, we review recent progress on the synthesis and tailoring of DJ and ACI LHP crystals and thin films, as well as their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Finally, we discuss possible pathways to overcome critical challenges to realize the full potential of DJ and ACI LHPs for high&#8208;performance solar cells and beyond.

         <title>Fluorinated Sulfinates as Source of Alkyl Radicals in the Photo&#8208;Enantiocontrolled &#946;&#8208;Functionalization of Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a widespread of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less&#8208;stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading&#8208;mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8208;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light&#8208;driven insertion of gem&#8208;difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR/Cas9 is emerging as a platform for gene therapeutics, and the treatment efficiency is expected to be enhanced by combination with other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem that enables co&#8208;delivery of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme for the combined gene therapy of cancer. Ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chains, which contained the recognition sequences of sgRNA in Cas9/sgRNA, DNAzyme sequence and HhaI enzyme cleavage site, were synthesized as the scaffold of the nanosystem. The DNAzyme cofactor Mn2+ was used to compress DNA chains to form nanoparticles and acid degradable polymer&#8208;coated HhaI enzymes were assembled on the surface of nanoparticles. In response to protons in lysosome, the polymer coating was decomposed and HhaI enzyme was consequently exposed to recognize and cut off the cleavage sites, thus triggering the release of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme to regulate gene expressions to achieve a high therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimide&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113780) by Byeong&#8208;Su Kim et&#8197;al. via a geomimetic hydrothermal reaction, yielding materials having various pore dimensions and crystal structures. The solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the growth mechanism and reaction pathway, which determined the 3D stacking structures of the polyimide&#8208;based COFs.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Triggered Solar Hydrogen Production via Platinum(II) Tethered Chalcogenoviologens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional solar energy conversion offers a feasible strategy to solve energy, environmental and water crises. In this contribution, a series of platinum(II) tethered chalcogenoviologens (PtL  +  &#8208;EV  2+  , E = S, Se, Te) is reported, which integrated the functions of photosensitizer, electron mediator and catalyst. PtL  +  &#8208;EV  2+  (particularly for PtL  +  &#8208;SeV  2+  )&#8208;based one&#8208;component solar H  2  production could be triggered not only by EDTA, but also by facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria relying on the simplified mechanism, along with efficient antibacterial activities. In addition, by using the real pool water, PtL  +  &#8208;SeV  2+  achieved multiple functions, including H  2  production, antibacterial action and acid removal, which supplied a new strategy to solve various problems in real life via a single system.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of NH&#8208;Unprotected Spiropyrrolidines and Spiroisoindolines by [4+1] Cyclizations of &#947;&#8208;Azidoboronic Acids with Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones of cyclic ketones are readily transformed into NH&#8208;free spirocyclic pyrrolidines and isoindolines by reaction with &#947;&#8208;azidoboronic acids. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free transformation is widely applicable and represents a new disconnection towards spirocyclic pyrrolidines. The application of the reaction in the modification of natural steroids and other biorelevant molecules highlights the synthetic usefulness of the methodology.







Abstract
The reactions of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones derived from cyclic ketones with &#947;&#8208;azidopropylboronic acid and 2&#8208;(azidomethyl)phenylboronic acid give rise to spirocyclic pyrrolidines and spiroisoindolines, respectively. The reactions proceed without the need of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst through a domino process that comprises the formation of a Csp3&#8208;C and a Csp3&#8208;N bond of the former hydrazonic carbon. The scope of the reaction has been explored by the preparation of over 50 examples of NH&#8208;unprotected spirocyclic derivatives. Importantly, this methodology could be applied for the preparation of alkaloid steroids from steroid N&#8208;tosylhydrazones.

         <title>Moderate Surface Segregation Promotes Selective Ethanol Production in CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction over CoCu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is described for theory&#8208;based catalyst optimization of CoCu alloys in CO2 hydrogenation. Moderate Co surface segregation, boosted ethanol production, and suppressed methane generation suggest that theory&#8208;guided catalyst optimization could be beneficial in similar alloy systems.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;copper (CoCu) catalysts have industrial potential in CO/CO2 hydrogenation reactions, and CoCu alloy has been elucidated as a major active phase during reactions. However, due to elemental surface segregation and dealloying phenomena, the actual surface morphology of CoCu alloy is still unclear. Combining theory and experiment, the dual effect of surface segregation and varied CO coverage over the CoCu(111) surface on the reactivity in CO2 hydrogenation reactions is explored. The relationship between C&#8722;O bond scission and further hydrogenation of intermediate *CH2O was discovered to be a key step to promote ethanol production. The theoretical investigation suggests that moderate Co segregation provides a suitable surface Co ensemble with lateral interactions of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO, leading to promoted selectivity to ethanol, in agreement with theory&#8208;inspired experiments.

         <title>An Expanded 2D Fused Aromatic Network with 90&#8208;Ring Hexagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic network with a honeycomb lattice constituted of 90&#8208;ring hexagons, the largest yet reported, was obtained by solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic networks (2D&#8197;FANs) have emerged as a highly versatile alternative to holey graphene. The synthesis of 2D&#8197;FANs with increasingly larger lattice dimensions will enable new application perspectives. However, the synthesis of larger analogues is mostly limited by lack of appropriate monomers and methods. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterisation and properties of an expanded 2D&#8197;FAN with 90&#8208;ring hexagons, which exceed the largest 2D&#8197;FAN lattices reported to date.

         <title>Tailoring the Pore Surface of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Synthetic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly crystalline 3D COFs with variable loadings of ethynyl groups were designed and synthesized. Remarkably, these alkyne&#8208;tagged 3D COFs provide a platform for targeted anchoring various organic groups onto the pore walls via click reactions, which can accordingly change their properties, e.g., the obtained click products exhibited higher CO2/N2 selectivity.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) have gained increasing attention for their attractive features. However, the development of 3D COFs is strongly restricted, mainly due to their synthetic difficulty and complicated structure determination. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, which can avoid these problems by incorporating functional moieties into a predetermined framework, provides an alternative way to construct 3D COFs with specific functions. Herein, we report the designed synthesis and characterization of a series of highly crystalline 3D COFs with different loadings of ethynyl groups. Notably, these alkyne&#8208;tagged 3D COFs provide a platform for targeted anchoring various specific groups onto the pore walls via click reactions. Moreover, the pore surface engineering can accordingly change their properties, for example, the obtained click products exhibited higher CO2/N2 selectivity. We describe a simple but powerful strategy to build functional 3D COFs, which will certainly advance them for a ranging of interesting applications in the future.

NIR&#8208;II hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were devised to oxidize &#946;&#8208;amyloid spatiotemporally and noninvasively. The well&#8208;designed photocatalyst shows an inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation and recovery of memory deficits in triple&#8208;transgenic AD model mice upon the NIR&#8208;II irradiation.







Abstract
Phototherapy has emerged as a powerful approach for interrupting &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) self&#8208;assembly. However, deeper tissue penetration and safer photosensitizers are urgent to be exploited for avoiding damaging nearby normal tissues and improving therapeutic effectiveness. A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II photooxygenation catalyst is presented here to settle the abovementioned challenges. By encapsulating the pyridinium hemicyanine dye DSM with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section in NIR&#8208;II window into the porphyrin&#8208;based HOF, the resultant DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 exhibits significant two&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;II&#8208;excited Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for A&#946; oxidation. Further, the target peptides of KLVFFAED (KD8) are covalently grafted on DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 to enhance the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability and A&#946; selectivity. The HOF&#8208;based photooxygenation catalyst shows an outstanding inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation upon the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Further in vivo studies demonstrate the obvious decrease of craniocerebral A&#946; plaques and recovery of memory deficits in triple&#8208;transgenic AD (3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD) model mice.

         <title>Detection and Imaging of the Plant Pathogen Response by Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Polyphenol Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are presented. These sensors probe the polyphenol content in complex biological systems such as the plant rhizosphere. In summary, this approach enables real&#8208;time spatiotemporal visualization of plant defense via polyphenols release.







Abstract
Plants use secondary metabolites such as polyphenols for chemical defense against pathogens and herbivores. Despite their importance in plant pathogen interactions and tolerance to diseases, it remains challenging to detect polyphenols in complex plant tissues. Here, we create molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging that are based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We identified polyethylene glycol&#8211;phospholipids that render (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs sensitive (Kd=90&#8197;nM) to plant polyphenols (tannins, flavonoids, &#8230;), which red&#8208;shift (up to 20&#8197;nm) and quench their emission (ca. 1000&#8197;nm). These sensors report changes in total polyphenol level after herbivore or pathogen challenge in crop plant systems (Soybean Glycine max) and leaf tissue extracts (Tococa spp.). We furthermore demonstrate remote chemical imaging of pathogen&#8208;induced polyphenol release from roots of soybean seedlings over the time course of 24&#8197;h. This approach allows in situ visualization and understanding of the chemical plant defense in real time and paves the way for plant phenotyping for optimized polyphenol secretion.

         <title>Cascaded Nanozyme System with High Reaction Selectivity by Substrate Screening and Channeling in a Microfluidic Device**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction selectivity of a nanozyme system was enhanced by screening and channeling of substrates. A catalytic cascade incorporating N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages with oxidase&#8208;like activity, and Prussian blue nanoparticles with peroxidase&#8208;like activity, improved reaction selectivity by more than 2000 times.







Abstract
Surpassing natural enzymes in cost, stability and mass production, nanozymes have attracted wide attention in fields from disease diagnosis to tumor therapy. However, nanozymes intrinsically have low reaction selectivity, which significantly restricts their applications. A general method is reported to address this challenge by following a biomimetic operation principle of substrates channeling and screening. Two oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymes (i.e., emerging N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages and Prussian blue nanoparticles), were cascaded as a proof of concept to improve the reaction selectivity in transforming the substrate into the targeted product by more than 2000 times. The cascaded nanozymes were also adopted to a spatially confined microfluidic device, leading to more than 100&#8208;fold enhancement of the reaction efficiency due to signal amplification.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling Is Unlikely to Be the Rate&#8208;Determining Step in the Formation of C2+ Products in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Reduction of CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetic and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopic results indicate that the C&#8722;C coupling is unlikely to be the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the formation of C2+ products in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction. Electrochemical hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water as the proton donor is proposed as the RDS.







Abstract
The identity of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu catalysts remains unresolved because: 1)&#8197;the presence of mass transport limitation of CO; and 2)&#8197;the absence of quantitative correlation between CO partial pressure (pCO) and surface CO coverage. In this work, we determined CO adsorption isotherms on Cu in a broad pH range of 7.2&#8211;12.9. Together with electrokinetic data, we demonstrate that the reaction orders of adsorbed CO at pCO &lt;0.4 and &gt;0.6 atm are 1st and 0th, respectively, for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products on three Cu catalysts. These results indicate that the C&#8722;C coupling is unlikely to be the RDS in the formation of C2+ products in the CORR. We propose that the hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water is the RDS, and the site competition between CO and water leads to the observed transition of the CO reaction order.

         <title>Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the reaction of the [Cu11H2{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3] template with Cu+ or Ag+ produces Cu12H2 and AgCu14H2 species in which the hydrides behave as Lewis bases, in the reaction with Au+, the hydrides act as reducing agents, leading to a luminescent, two&#8208;electron Au@Cu11 superatom, whose metal core has a defect fcc structure.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to surface hydrides, reactivities of interstitial hydrides are difficult to explore. When treated with a metal ion (Cu+, Ag+, and Au+), the stable CuI dihydride template [Cu11H2{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3] (H2Cu11) generates surprisingly three very different compounds, namely [CuH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3]+ (1), [AgH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6((C&#8801;CPh)6]+ (2), and [AuCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3Cl] (3). Compounds 1 and 2 are both MI species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their H2Cu11 precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal hydride coordination mode in the AgCu3 environment of 2. 3 has no hydride and exhibits a mixed&#8208;valent [AuCu11]10+ metal core, making it a two&#8208;electron superatom.

When treated with a metal ion (Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; dihydride template [Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) generates surprisingly three very different compounds, namely [CuH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [AgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;((C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and [AuCu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are both M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal-pyramidal hydride coordination mode in the AgCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; environment of &lt;b&gt;2. 3&lt;/b&gt; has no hydride and exhibits a mixed-valent [AuCu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10+&lt;/sup&gt; metal core, making it a two-electron superatom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Enabled Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

By incorporating intramolecular S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent interactions (INIs) for boosting the intrinsic hole mobilities, two simple&#8208;structured dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) were designed and delivered a remarkable efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with decent device stability in inverted perovskite solar cells, demonstrating the great promise of the INI strategy for accessing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions (INIs) have served as a powerful strategy for accessing organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport properties. Herein, we apply the INI strategy for developing dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) by constructing two small&#8208;molecular HTMs featuring an INI&#8208;integrated backbone for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Upon incorporating noncovalent S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction into their simple&#8208;structured backbones, the resulting HTMs, BTORA and BTORCNA, showed self&#8208;planarized backbones, tuned energy levels, enhanced thermal properties, appropriate film morphology, and effective defect passivation. More importantly, the high film crystallinity enables the materials with substantial hole mobilities, thus rendering them as promising dopant&#8208;free HTMs. Consequently, the BTORCNA&#8208;based inverted PVSCs delivered a power conversion efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with encouraging long&#8208;term device stability, outperforming the devices based on BTRA without S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction (18.40&#8201;%). This work offers a practical approach to designing charge transporting layers with high intrinsic mobilities for high&#8208;performance PVSCs.

         <title>Transport of Molecular Cargo by Interaction with Virus&#8208;Like Particle RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of intercalating dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) to polynucleotides allows for a simple method to load RNA&#8208;rich virus&#8208;like particles with molecular cargo, and then to release that cargo by diffusion. TO&#8208;labeled molecules come out much slower than they go in because of the high RNA concentration inside the shell; the surprise is how much cargo these easily produced nanocontainers can carry.







Abstract
Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) derived from Leviviridae virions contain substantial amounts of cellular and plasmid&#8208;derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye thiazole orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying length, end&#8208;functionalized with TO, were loaded into VLPs up to approximately 50&#8201;% of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO&#8211;PEG binding included a significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20&#8211;120&#8197;hours following simple reversible first&#8208;order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a simple general method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of functional molecules inside nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of modifications to the capsid protein.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Hydrophobicity for Ultrafast Oil&#8211;Water Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2D robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability were synthesized by introducing mixed hydrophobic substituents. After coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, the superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating exhibits an excellent oil/water separation efficiency (&gt;99.5&#8201;%), high oil&#8208;permeation flux (2.84&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, high water&#8208;pressure resistance (&gt;15&#8197;kPa), and a high degree of reusability (&gt;50&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great potentials for addressing the challenge of highly efficient oil&#8211;water separation, but they are restricted by the poor wettability and processability as crystalline membranes. Here we report the design and synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability, allowing the COF layers to be directly grown on the support surfaces. Three 2D COFs with AA or ABC stacking are prepared by condensation of triamines with fluorine and/or isopropyl groups and perfluorodialdehyde. They all show excellent tolerance to water, acid, and base, with water contact angles (CA) of 111.5&#8211;145.8&#176;. The two COFs with isopropyl and fluorine mixtures can grow as a coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, whereas the one with only fluorine substituents cannot. The superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating with water CA of up to 150.1&#176; displays high water&#8208;resistance and self&#8208;cleaning properties, enabling high oil&#8211;water separation performances with an efficiency of over 99.5&#8201;% and a permeation flux of 2.84&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, which are among the highest values reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.

         <title>A Striking Mode of Activation of Carbon Disulfide with a Cooperative Bis(silylene)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected new type of cooperativity of the two silicon(II) atoms in a 1,4&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;bridged bis(silylene) towards CS2 is reported and the results are compared with that of related mono&#8208;silylenes. While a dearomatization occurs with the bis&#8208;silylene, a novel mesoionic five&#8208;membered Si2S2C heterocyclic compound, among other new products, results from stepwise degradation of CS2 with mono&#8208;silylenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;substituted bis(silylenyl)terphenylene 1, 1,4&#8208;[ortho&#8208;(LSi)C6H4]2C6H4, (L=RC(NtBu)2, R=Ph, Mes) towards CS2 is reported. It results in a dearomatization of the phenylene ring, affording the 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclohexadiene derivative 2. According to DFT calculations, a transient silene containing a Si=C bond capable of &#960;(C=C) addition at the aromatic phenylene ring is a key intermediate. In contrast, addition of CS2 to the biphenyl&#8208;substituted mono&#8208;silylene ortho&#8208;(LSi)C6H4&#8208;C6H5 3 leaves the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system intact and forms, in a [1+2] cycloaddition reaction, the corresponding thiasilirane 4 with a three&#8208;membered SiSC ring. Further experimental studies led to the isolation of the novel mesoionic five&#8208;membered Si2S2C heterocycle 6, which reacts with CS2 under C&#8722;C bond formation. All isolated new compounds were fully characterized and their molecular structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

     alt="A Striking Mode of Activation of Carbon Disulfide with a Cooperative Bis(silylene)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unexpected new type of cooperativity of the two silicon(II) atoms in a 1,4-terphenyl-bridged bis(silylene) towards CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported and the results are compared with that of related mono-silylenes. While a dearomatization occurs with the bis-silylene, a novel mesoionic five-membered Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C heterocyclic compound, among other new products, results from stepwise degradation of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with mono-silylenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of the 1,4-substituted bis(silylenyl)terphenylene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 1,4-[&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-(LSi)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, (L=RC(NtBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, R=Ph, Mes) towards CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported. It results in a dearomatization of the phenylene ring, affording the 1,3-substituted cyclohexadiene derivative &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. According to DFT calculations, a transient silene containing a Si=C bond capable of &#960;(C=C) addition at the aromatic phenylene ring is a key intermediate. In contrast, addition of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the biphenyl-substituted mono-silylene &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-(LSi)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; leaves the aromatic &#960;-system intact and forms, in a [1+2] cycloaddition reaction, the corresponding thiasilirane &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with a three-membered SiSC ring. Further experimental studies led to the isolation of the novel mesoionic five-membered Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C heterocycle &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, which reacts with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under C&#8722;C bond formation. All isolated new compounds were fully characterized and their molecular structures determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Halogen Bond&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=Cl, Br, I) type weak halogen bonds induce the formation of supramolecular helical structures both in solid and solution state. The halogen bonds could further influence the helical nanoarchitectures in mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;component coassemblies with melamine, providing a flexible route to prepare chiral functional materials.







Abstract
The halogen bond is the attractive interaction between the electrophilic region of a halogen atom and the nucleophilic region of another molecular entity, emerging as a favorable manner to manipulate supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assemblies. Engineering halogen bonded helical structures remains a challenge due to its sensitivity to solvent polarity and competitive forces like hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=Cl, Br, I) type weak halogen bond that induces the formation and evolution of supramolecular helical structures both in solid and solution state. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylalanine derivatives with F, Cl, Br and I substitution self&#8208;assembled into 21 helical packing driven by hydrogen bond and halogen bond, respectively. The specific molecular geometries of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids gave rise to multiple noncovalent forces to stabilize the X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X halogen bond with small bond energies ranging from &#8722;0.69 to &#8722;1.49&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Halogen bond induced an opposite helicity compared to the fluorinated species, accompanied by the inversed circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of [1.1.1]Propellane for the Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third way: the umpolung of nucleophilic [1.1.1]propellane into an electrophilic halogen bond complex enables the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) after attack of anilines and azoles. DFT calculations show that the halogen bond interaction helps avoiding the decomposition of the BCP cage. This approach opens a third avenue to access functionalised BCPs besides the better explored radical and anionic strategies.







Abstract
Strategies commonly used for the synthesis of functionalised bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) rely on the reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with anionic or radical intermediates. In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron&#8208;neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen&#8208;substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery. A detailed computational analysis indicates that the key halogen bonding interaction promotes nucleophilic attack without sacrificing cage stabilisation. Overall, our work rehabilitates electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane as a valuable strategy for accessing functionalised BCPs.

         <title>Labile Photo&#8208;Induced Free Radical in &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutaric Acid: a Universal Endogenous Polarizing Agent for In&#8197;Vivo Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutaric acid (&#945;&#8208;KG) has an exceptionally high free radical yield under photo&#8208;irradiation at cryogenic temperature. This radical can be used as a universal polarizing agent to hyperpolarize 13C&#8208;molecules such as [1&#8208;13C]lactate, a promising alternative to pyruvate for in vivo metabolic studies by 13C magnetic resonance.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance enables non&#8208;invasive probing of metabolism in vivo. To date, only 13C&#8208;molecules hyperpolarized with persistent trityl radicals have been injected in humans. We show here that the free radical photo&#8208;induced in alpha&#8208;ketoglutaric acid (&#945;&#8208;KG) can be used to hyperpolarize photo&#8208;inactive 13C&#8208;molecules such as [1&#8208;13C]lactate. &#945;&#8208;KG is an endogenous molecule with an exceptionally high radical yield under photo&#8208;irradiation, up to 50&#8201;%, and its breakdown product, succinic acid, is also endogenous. This radical precursor therefore exhibits an excellent safety profile for translation to human studies. The labile nature of the radical means that no filtration is required prior to injection while also offering the opportunity to extend the 13C relaxation time in frozen HP 13C&#8208;molecules for storage and transport. The potential for in vivo metabolic studies is demonstrated in the rat liver following the injection of a physiological dose of HP [1&#8208;13C]lactate.

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change during the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a nonlinear kinetic model for crystal reactions allows us to quantify for the first time how the kinetics depend on sample morphology. Furthermore, the quantitative connection between molecular reaction kinetics and mechanical response in well&#8208;defined single crystals provides a new benchmark for analyzing these photomechanical materials.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high&#8208;quality single crystals of 9&#8208;methylanthracene (9MA) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7&#8201;% along the c&#8208;axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress. The same expansion dynamics are highly reproducible across different single crystal samples. Organic single crystals exhibit well&#8208;defined linear expansions during 100&#8201;% photoconversion, suggesting that this class of solid&#8208;state phase change material could be used for actuation.

         <title>An Exceptional Thermally Induced Four&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch Arising from Stepwise Molecular Dynamic Changes in a New Hybrid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple hybrid salt has been synthesized that exhibits reversible multistep phase transitions and an unprecedented thermally induced three&#8208;step &#8220;silent&#8208;medium&#8208;low&#8208;high&#8221; second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation switching behavior. This behavior arises from complex and stepwise molecular dynamic changes of the polar organic cations.







Abstract
Switching materials in channels of nonlinear optics (NLOs) are of particular interest in NLO material science. Numerous crystalline NLO switches based on structural phase transition have emerged, but most of them reveal a single&#8208;step switch between two different second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) states, and only very rare cases involve three or more SHG states. Herein, we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid salt, (Me3NNH2)2[CdI4], which is an unprecedented case of a reversible three&#8208;step NLO switch between SHG&#8208;silent, &#8208;medium, &#8208;low, and &#8208;high states, with high contrasts of 25.5/4.3/9.2 in a temperature range of 213&#8211;303&#8197;K. By using the combined techniques of variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses, dielectric constants, solid&#8208;state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Hirshfeld surface analyses, we disclose that this four&#8208;state switchable SHG behavior is highly associated with the stepwise&#8208;changed molecular dynamics of the polar organic cations. This finding demonstrates well the complexity of molecular dynamics in simple hybrid salts and their potential in designing new advanced multistep switching materials.

         <title>3D Binary Mesocrystals from Anisotropic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles into large superstructures is a key component in the research of novel metamaterials. While the formation of mono&#8208;phase mesocrystals has been achieved in recent years, the self&#8208;assembly of binary structures from such particles remained highly challenging. A simple method enables the formation of binary mesocrystals from anisotropic iron oxide and platinum nanocubes in two and three dimensions.







Abstract
Binary mesocrystals offer the combination of nanocrystal properties in an ordered superstructure. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous self&#8208;assembly of platinum and iron oxide nanocubes into micrometer&#8208;sized 3D&#8197;mesocrystals using the gas&#8208;phase diffusion technique. By the addition of minor amounts of a secondary particle type tailored to nearly identical size, shape and surface chemistry, we were able to promote a random incorporation of foreign particles into a self&#8208;assembling host lattice. The random distribution of the binary particle types on the surface and within its bulk has been visualized using advanced transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The 20&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m sized binary mesocrystals have been further characterized through wide and small angle scattering techniques to reveal a long&#8208;range ordering on the atomic scale throughout the crystal while showing clear evidence that the material consists of individual building blocks. Through careful adjustments of the crystallization parameters, we could further obtain a reverse superstructure, where incorporated particles and host lattice switch roles.

         <title>Discovery and Mechanism of Action of Small Molecule Inhibitors of Ceramidases**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of synthetic fluorescent ceramide molecules allows the discovery of the first selective drug&#8208;like small molecule inhibitors for alkaline ceramidase 3, an intra&#8208;membrane enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism in health and disease. These inhibitors represent a new paradigm for controlling lipid metabolism with drug&#8208;like small molecules targeting conformationally dynamic membrane proteins.







Abstract
Sphingolipid metabolism is tightly controlled by enzymes to regulate essential processes in human physiology. The central metabolite is ceramide, a pro&#8208;apoptotic lipid catabolized by ceramidase enzymes to produce pro&#8208;proliferative sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Alkaline ceramidases are transmembrane enzymes that recently attracted attention for drug development in fatty liver diseases. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, no specific small molecule inhibitors have been reported. We present the discovery and mechanism of action of the first drug&#8208;like inhibitors of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3). In particular, we chemically engineered novel fluorescent ceramide substrates enabling screening of large compound libraries and characterized enzyme:inhibitor interactions using mass spectrometry and MD simulations. In addition to revealing a new paradigm for inhibition of lipid metabolising enzymes with non&#8208;lipidic small molecules, our data lay the ground for targeting ACER3 in drug discovery efforts.

         <title>A Unified View on Varied Ultrafast Dynamics of the Primary Process in Microbial Rhodopsins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics observed in the primary photoreaction of microbial rhodopsins are the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity arising from the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of the amino acid residue acting as the counterion of a protonated retinal Schiff base chromophore.







Abstract
All&#8208;trans to 13&#8208;cis photoisomerization of the protonated retinal Schiff base (PRSB) chromophore is the primary step that triggers various biological functions of microbial rhodopsins. While this ultrafast primary process has been extensively studied, it has been recognized that the relevant excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics differ significantly from one rhodopsin to another. To elucidate the origin of the complicated ultrafast dynamics of the primary process in microbial rhodopsins, we studied the excited&#8208;state dynamics of proteorhodopsin, its D97N mutant, and bacteriorhodopsin by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption (TA) spectroscopy in a wide pH range. The TA data showed that their excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics drastically change when pH approaches the pKa of the counterion residue of the PRSB chromophore in the ground state. This result reveals that the varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics in different rhodopsins mainly originate from the difference of the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity (i.e., protonation/deprotonation of the PRSB counterion).

         <title>Zr(OH)4&#8208;Catalyzed Controllable Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azoxybenzenes, Azobenzenes and Nitrosobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr(OH)4 can catalyze the selective oxidation of anilines to azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes and nitrosobenzenes for a wide range of substrates. Control experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the activation of H2O2 and O2 can be attributed to the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)4, respectively.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of aniline to metastable and valuable azoxybenzene, azobenzene or nitrosobenzene has important practical significance in organic synthesis. However, uncontrollable selectivity and laborious synthesis of the expensive required catalysts severely hinders the uptake of these reactions in industrial settings. Herein, we have pioneered the discovery of Zr(OH)4 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst capable of the selective oxidation of aniline, using either peroxide or O2 as oxidant, to selectively obtain various azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes, as well as nitrosobenzenes, by simply regulating the reaction solvent, without the need for additives. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of H2O2 and O2 is primarily achieved by the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)4, respectively. The present work provides an economical and environmentally friendly strategy for the selective oxidation of aniline in industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;The selective oxidation of aniline to metastable and valuable azoxybenzene, azobenzene or nitrosobenzene has important practical significance in organic synthesis. However, uncontrollable selectivity and laborious synthesis of the expensive required catalysts severely hinders the uptake of these reactions in industrial settings. Herein, we have pioneered the discovery of Zr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst capable of the selective oxidation of aniline, using either peroxide or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as oxidant, to selectively obtain various azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes, as well as nitrosobenzenes, by simply regulating the reaction solvent, without the need for additives. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is primarily achieved by the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The present work provides an economical and environmentally friendly strategy for the selective oxidation of aniline in industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Nanoislands on Ni/C Hybrid Nanosheet Activate Superior Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Efficiency H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array with dual&#8208;active nanoisland sites is reported. One type of island represents the bare Ni particle surface, the other consists of core&#8211;shell Ni@C structures (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA). The catalyst achieves efficient hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Clean hydrogen evolution through electrochemical water splitting underpins various innovative approaches to the pursuit of sustainable energy conversion technologies, but it is blocked by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has been considered as one of the most promising substitute for OER to improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we construct novel dual nanoislands on Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array: one kind of island represents the part of bare Ni particle surface, while the other stands for the part of core&#8211;shell Ni@C structure (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA), in which exposed Ni atoms and Ni&#8208;decorated carbon shell perform as active sites for HzOR and HER respectively. As a result, when the current density reaches 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the working potentials are merely &#8722;37&#8197;mV for HER and &#8208;20 mV for HzOR. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer exhibits superb activity that only requires an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.14&#8197;V to achieve 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multiphoton Excitation Regulator for the Activation of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through covalent modification of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide mimics and CeIII&#8208;OEt moieties in a metal&#8211;organic framework, a new multiphoton excitation approach was developed. This new strategy enables step&#8208;by&#8208;step triggering of the photoinduced electron transfer, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer and hydrogen atom transfer processes for activation of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen.







Abstract
The activation and oxidization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into value&#8208;added chemicals affords attractively economic and ecological benefits as well as central challenge in modern chemistry. Inspired by the natural enzymatic transformation, herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach to activate the inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen by integrating the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) events together into one metal&#8208;organic framework. The well&#8208;modified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) mimics oxidized CeIII&#8208;OEt moieties to generate CeIV&#8208;OEt chromophore and its reduced state mimics NAD. via PET. The in situ formed CeIV&#8208;OEt moiety triggers a LMCT excitation to form the alkoxy radical EtO., abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, accompanying the recovery of CeIII&#8208;OEt and the formation of alkyl radicals. The formed NAD. activates oxygen to regenerate the NAD+ for next recycle, wherein, the activated oxygen species interacts with the intermediates for the oxidization functionalization, paving a catalytic avenue for developing scalable and sustainable synthetic strategy.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Visualization of Proton Transport Pathways at Water&#8211;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a method for imaging aqueous proton transport with spatial resolution and observed the lateral transport of protons along the nanofluidic interface. The dynamics of proton transport can be further captured by quantitative analysis, thanks to the temporal resolution of this optical imaging technique.







Abstract
Probing proton transport is of vital importance for understanding cellular transport, surface catalysis and fuel cells. Conventional proton transport measurements rely on the use of electrochemical conductivity and do not allow for the direct visualization of proton transport pathways. The development of novel experimental techniques to spatiotemporally resolve proton transport is in high demand. Here, building upon the general conversion of aqueous proton flux into spatially resolved fluorescence signals, we optically visualize proton transport through nanopores and along hydrophilic interfaces. We observed that the fluorescence intensity increased at negative voltage due to lateral transport. Thanks to the temporal resolution of optical imaging, our technique further empowers the analysis of proton transport dynamics.

         <title>Eutectic Crystallization Activates Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered a novel crystallized Zn2+ conductor based on inducing crystallization of high&#8208;entropy, charge&#8208;separated eutectic liquids. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first introduction of the concept of a crystallized eutectic material to achieve dramatically enhanced multivalent&#8208;ion transport properties. This facile strategy may also open up opportunities for designing a wide variety of new solid ionic conductors.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state zinc (Zn) batteries offer a new candidate for emerging applications sensitive to volume, safety and cost. However, current solid polymeric or ceramic electrolyte structures remain poorly conductive for the divalent Zn2+, especially at room temperature. Constructing a heterogeneous interface which allows Zn2+ percolation is a viable option, but this is rarely involved in multivalent systems. Herein, we construct a solid Zn2+&#8208;ion conductor by inducing crystallization of tailored eutectic liquids formed by organic Zn salts and bipolar ligands. High&#8208;entropy eutectic&#8208;networks weaken the ion&#8208;association and form interfacial Zn2+&#8208;percolated channels on the nucleator surfaces, resulting in a solid crystal with exceptional selectivity for Zn2+ transport (t
=0.64) and appreciable Zn2+ conductivity (&#963;
=3.78&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, over 2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymers), and finally enabling practical ambient&#8208;temperature Zn/V2O5 metal solid cells. This design principle leveraged by the eutectic solidification affords new insights on the multivalent solid electrochemistry suffering from slow ion migration.

         <title>Highly Ethylene&#8208;Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enabled by Isolated Cu&#8722;S Motifs in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 precatalyst with stable isolated Cu&#8722;S motifs was prepared by the strategy of local sulfur doping. The precatalyst can be in situ reconstructed to obtain a Cu(S) matrix with active biphasic copper/copper sulfide interfaces, which delivers a current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Faradaic efficiency of ethylene to 57.2&#8201;% in the flow cell.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based materials are efficient electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to C2+ products, and most these materials are reconstructed in situ to regenerate active species. It is a challenge to precisely design precatalysts to obtain active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we develop a strategy based on local sulfur doping of a Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework precatalyst, in which the stable Cu&#8722;S motif is dispersed in the framework of HKUST&#8208;1 (S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1). The precatalyst exhibits a high ethylene selectivity in an H&#8208;type cell with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.0&#8201;%, and delivers a current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an ethylene FE up to 57.2&#8201;% in a flow cell. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption results demonstrate that Cu&#948;+ species stabilized by the Cu&#8722;S motif exist in S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 during CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations indicate the partially oxidized Cu&#948;+ at the Cu/CuxSy interface is favorable for coupling of the *CO intermediate due to the modest distance between coupling sites and optimized adsorption energy.

         <title>Conformational Flexibility of the Protein Insertase BamA in the Native Asymmetric Bilayer Elucidated by ESR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is an asymmetric bilayer. The effect of this asymmetry on protein structure and dynamics remains elusive. The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) mediates the folding and insertion of proteins into the outer membrane. Using in situ electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we show that the native outer membrane significantly enhances the dynamics of the BamA insertase of the BAM complex.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) consisting of the central &#946;&#8208;barrel BamA and four other lipoproteins mediates the folding of the majority of the outer membrane proteins. BamA is placed in an asymmetric bilayer and its lateral gate is suggested to be the functional hotspot. Here we used in situ pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy to characterize BamA in the native outer membrane. In the detergent micelles, the data is consistent with mainly an inward&#8208;open conformation of BamA. The native membrane considerably enhanced the conformational heterogeneity. The lateral gate and the extracellular loop 3 exist in an equilibrium between different conformations. The outer membrane provides a favorable environment for occupying multiple conformational states independent of the lipoproteins. Our results reveal a highly dynamic behavior of the lateral gate and other key structural elements and provide direct evidence for the conformational modulation of a membrane protein in situ.

         <title>Sterically Wrapped Multiple Resonance Fluorophors for Suppression of Concentration Quenching and Spectrum Broadening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically wrapped multiple resonance (MR) dopants with the MR&#8208;core sandwiched by bulk substituents have been developed to suppress molecular interactions, realizing organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3&#8211;37.2&#8201;%, identical small FWHMs of 24&#8197;nm and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;20&#8197;wt&#8201;%).







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) emitters are promising for highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrowband emission; however, they still face intractable challenges with concentration&#8208;caused emission quenching, exciton annihilation, and spectral broadening. In this study, sterically wrapped MR dopants with a fluorescent MR core sandwiched by bulk substituents were developed to address the intractable challenges by reducing intermolecular interactions. Consequently, high photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields of &#8805;90&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &#8804;25&#8197;nm over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;20&#8197;wt&#8201;%) were recorded. In addition, we demonstrated that the sandwiched MR emitter can effectively suppress Dexter interaction when doped in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, eliminating exciton loss through dopant triplet. Within the above dopant concentration range, the optimal emitter realizes remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3&#8211;37.2&#8201;%, identical small FWHMs of 24&#8197;nm, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs in OLEDs.

         <title>Highly Processable Covalent Organic Framework Gel Electrolyte Enabled by Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a general gelation strategy for the construction of highly processible covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;Gel materials through side&#8208;chain engineering. The COF&#8208;Gel is compatible with electronic devices with diverse functionality, including in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with a graphene&#8208;like structure present unique chemical and physical properties, they are essentially insoluble and infusible crystalline powders with poor processability, hindering their further practical applications. How to improve the processability of COF materials is a major challenge in this field. In this contribution, we proposed a general side&#8208;chain engineering strategy to construct a gel&#8208;state COF with high processability. This method takes advantages of large and soft branched alkyl side chains as internal plasticizers to achieve the gelation of the COF. We systematically studied the influence of the length of the side chain on the COF gel formation. Benefitting from their machinability and flexibility, this novel COF gel can be easily processed into gel&#8208;type electrolytes with specific shape and thickness, which were further applied to assemble lithium&#8208;ion batteries that exhibited high cycling stability.

         <title>Clippane: A Mechanically Interlocked Molecule (MIM) Based on Molecular Tweezers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new type of MIM comprised by two &#8220;open&#8221; U&#8208;shaped metallotweezers. The dissociation into its two components is hampered by mechanical bonds, as the presence of bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups provides the mechanical coercion required for avoiding the slippage that would otherwise produce the disassembly.







Abstract
In this study we report the preparation of a new mechanically interlocked molecule formed by the self&#8208;aggregation of two metallotweezers composed by two pyrene&#8208;imidazolylidene gold(I) arms and a pyridine&#8208;centered pentacyclic bis&#8208;alkynyl linker. The mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule arises from the presence of the bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups attached to the sides of the pyrene moieties of the arms of the tweezer, which act as stoppers avoiding the dissociation of the self&#8208;aggregated metallotweezer dimer once it is formed. By combining experimental techniques, we were able to confirm the mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule in solution, in the gas phase and in the solid state. The behavior of the tert&#8208;butyl substituted tweezer differs greatly form that shown by the tweezer lacking of these bulky groups, whose dimeric structure is in equilibrium with the monomeric structure, therefore not showing any mechanical coercion that avoids the disassembly of the self&#8208;aggregated structure.

The mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule arises from the presence of the bulky &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl groups attached to the sides of the pyrene moieties of the arms of the tweezer, which act as stoppers avoiding the dissociation of the self-aggregated metallotweezer dimer once it is formed. By combining experimental techniques, we were able to confirm the mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule in solution, in the gas phase and in the solid state. The behavior of the &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl substituted tweezer differs greatly form that shown by the tweezer lacking of these bulky groups, whose dimeric structure is in equilibrium with the monomeric structure, therefore not showing any mechanical coercion that avoids the disassembly of the self-aggregated structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancy Modulating Co3Sn2S2 Topological Semimetal for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 cathode was applied in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries with a discharge plateau around 1.5&#8197;V. Co3Sn1.8S2 activates Sn2+ and provides active sites with impressive charge&#8208;storage capabilities and fast kinetic processes. The material has high structural stability and conductivity, and an ionic diffusion rate that achieves appreciable cycling stability and capacity retention.







Abstract
Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with high electrical conductivity and suitable carrier density near the Fermi level are enticing candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), meriting from topological surface states (TSSs). We propose a WSM Co3Sn2S2 cathode for AZIBs showing a discharge plateau around 1.5&#8197;V. By introducing Sn vacancies, extra redox peaks from the Sn4+/Sn2+ transition appear, which leads to more Zn2+ transfer channels and active sites promoting charge&#8208;storage kinetics and Zn2+ storage capability. Co3Sn1.8S2 achieves a specific energy of 305&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 (0.2 Ag&#8722;1) and a specific power of 4900&#8197;Wkg&#8722;1 (5 Ag&#8722;1). Co3Sn1.8S2 and ZnxCo3Sn1.8S2 benefit from better conductivity at lower temperatures; the quasi&#8208;solid Co3Sn1.8S2//Zn battery delivers 126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.6 Ag&#8722;1) at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and a cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles (2 Ag&#8722;1) with 85&#8201;% capacity retention at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Inside Cover: Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the nature of M+ , the hydrides of the H2Cu11 reactant behave differently. In the case of M=Cu or Ag, they act as regular two&#8208;electron ligands yielding [CuH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3]+ (Cu12H2) or [AgH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)6]+ (AgH2Cu14); in the case of M=Au, they behave as electron donors to form [AuCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3Cl] (AuCu11). Details of the study are presented by Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202113266).

Binary mesocrystals demonstrate the combination of nanocrystals from different materials within a highly ordered manner. While nanocubes appear to be simple in their geometry, they can arrange in various ways into a complex entity that not only directs its habitus but also its properties. In their Research Article (e202112461), Helmut C&#246;lfen et&#8197;al. report on the formation and structural analysis of micrometer&#8208;sized two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional binary particle assemblies, revealing their mesocrystalline nature and highlighting their importance within the growing field of metamaterials.

Photomechanical crystals composed of 9&#8208;methylanthracene molecules were investigated by Daichi Kitagawa, Christopher J. Bardeen, Seiya Kobatake, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202114089). The crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. Moreover, the quantitative connection between molecular reaction kinetics and mechanical response in well&#8208;defined single crystals provides a new benchmark for analyzing these photomechanical materials.

         <title>Crystal Structure Classification of Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides as a Tool for the Design of Inorganic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classification of copper sulfides based on crystallographic features has been proposed from investigation of the structure&#8211;property relationships reported on their phases in dozens of publications from the fields of crystallography and materials for energy conversion. This classification reveals systematic trends that can be explained and exploited for the design and engineering of new environmentally friendly materials.







Abstract
Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties of inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension, and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth&#8208;abundant copper sulfides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulfides, associated with p&#8208; and/or d&#8208;block elements, is based on their crystallographic features and an analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimate some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) from consideration of only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies primarily on recent studies in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics as well as on crystal&#8208;structure investigations.

The conversion of methane driven by solar energy offers a promising approach to directly transform methane into valuable energy sources under mild conditions, but remains a great challenge. This Review highlights recent advances in the photocatalytic conversion of methane and gives insights into the design of effective semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts and classifies the photooxidations according to the oxidants in the reaction system.







Abstract
Abundant and affordable methane is not only a high&#8208;quality fossil fuel, it is also a raw material for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven conversion of methane offers a promising approach to directly transform methane to valuable energy sources under mild conditions, but remains a great challenge at present. In this Review, recent advances in the photocatalytic conversion of methane are systematically summarized. Insights into the construction of effective semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts from the perspective of light&#8208;absorption units and active centers are highlighted and discussed in detail. The performance of various photocatalysts in the conversion of methane is presented, with the photooxidation classified according to the oxidant systems. Lastly, challenges and future perspectives in the photocatalytic oxidation of methane are described.

         <title>Atomistic Insights of Irreversible Li+ Intercalation in MnO2 Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithiation front region of one &#946;&#8208;MnO2 nanowire analyzed by in&#8197;situ TEM, where the MnO2/LiMnO2 interface features arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, is disclosed with its atomic structure clearly captured. The findings have a bearing on MnO2 open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 represents open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage. Its wide application is limited by its poor cycling stability, whose structural origin is unclear. We tracked the structure evolution of &#946;&#8208;MnO2 upon Li+ ion insertion/extraction by combining advanced in&#8197;situ diagnostic tools at both electrode level (synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering) and single&#8208;particle level (transmission electron microscopy). The instability is found to originate from a partially reversible phase transition between &#946;&#8208;MnO2 and orthorhombic LiMnO2 upon lithiation, causing cycling capacity decay. Moreover, the MnO2/LiMnO2 interface exhibits multiple arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, which severely chop into the host and undermine its structural integrity. Our findings could account for the cycling instability of tunnel&#8208;structured materials, based on which future strategies should focus on tuning the charge transport kinetics toward performance enhancement.

         <title>Dynamic Manipulating Space&#8208;Resolved Persistent Luminescence in Core&#8211;Shell MOFs Heterostructures via Reversible Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiblock core&#8211;shell MOFs heterojunctions were prepared through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits both persistent luminescence and photochromic properties. The bright yellow afterglow in MOFs shell can be detected before irradiation but almost disappears after coloration upon continuous UV irradiation.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;controllable persistent luminescence at the single crystal level can be achieved by the integration of long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and photochromism within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for the first time. Moreover, the multiblock core&#8211;shell heterojunctions have been prepared utilizing the isostructural MOFs through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits bright yellow afterglow emission that gradually disappears upon further irradiation, but the core does not show such property. Benefitting from combined persistent luminescence and photochromic behavior, a multiple encryption demo can be facilely designed based on the dynamic manipulating RTP via reversible photochromism. This work not only develops new types of dynamically photo&#8208;controllable afterglow switch, but also provides a method to obtain MOFs&#8208;based optical heterojunctions towards potential space/time&#8208;resolved information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of a Macrobicyclic Olefin Bearing a Sacrificial Silyloxide Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;positions of the double bond as a new sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regio&#8208;selective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring with a substantial ring tension can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio&#8208;/stereospecificity.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has been regarded as a powerful tool for sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization. However, the traditional entropy&#8208;driven ROMP of macrocyclic olefins suffers from the lack of ring strain and poor regioselectivity, whereas the relay&#8208;ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization inevitably brings some unnecessary auxiliary structure into each monomeric unit. We developed a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;positions of the double bond as a new class of sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regioselective ROMP. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring, a 3&#8208;substituted cyclooctene structure with substantial ring tension, can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio&#8208;/stereospecificity. Besides, the silyloxide bridge can be sacrificially cleaved by desilylation and deoxygenation reactions to provide clean&#8208;structured, non&#8208;auxiliaried polymers.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Installation of N&#1013;&#8208;Modified Sidechains into Peptide and Protein Scaffolds via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Desulfurative C&#8211;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a rapid light&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction that enables installation of N&#1013;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins at defined positions. Selective for cysteine residues, the method proceeds via interception of free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated desulfurization. The chemistry is operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere, and retains the native stereochemistry at the modified residue.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) enhance the repertoire of protein function and mediate or influence the activity of many cellular processes. The preparation of site&#8208;specifically and homogeneously modified proteins, to apply as tools to understand the biological role of PTMs, is a challenging task. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated desulfurative C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond forming reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective installation of N&#1013;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins of interest. Rapid, operationally simple, and tolerant to ambient atmosphere, we demonstrate the installation of a range of lysine (Lys) PTMs into model peptide systems and showcase the potential of this technology by site&#8208;selectively installing an N&#1013;Ac sidechain into recombinantly expressed ubiquitin (Ub).

         <title>Folding&#8208;induced Fluorescence Enhancement in a Series of Merocyanine Hetero&#8208;Folda&#8208;Trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced fluorescence enhancement could be shown for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine dye in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy towards improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).







Abstract
Many dyes suffer from fast non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, thereby showing only short&#8208;lived excited states and weak photoluminescence. Here we show a pronounced fluorescence enhancement for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine (MC) dye by being co&#8208;facially stacked to other dyes in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. By means of fluorescence spectroscopy (lifetime, quantum yield) the fluorescence enhancement was explained by the rigidification of the emitting chromophore in the defined foldamer architecture and the presence of a non&#8208;forbidden lowest exciton state in H&#8208;coupled hetero&#8208;aggregates. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy toward improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).

         <title>Fully Condensed Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals: Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Structural Defects for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal, which features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structural defects, decorated with Pt and CoOx as redox cocatalysts efficiently drives the one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting for H2 and O2 production with a record apparent quantum efficiency of 12&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Conventional polymerization for the synthesis of carbon nitride usually generates amorphous heptazine&#8208;based melon with an abundance of undesired structural defects, which function as charge carrier recombination centers to decrease the photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structure defects was obtained by conducting the polycondensation in a mild molten salt of LiCl/NaCl. The melting point of the binary LiCl/NaCl system is around 550&#8201;&#176;C, which substantially restrain the depolymerization of triazine units and extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The optimized polymeric carbon nitride crystal exhibits a high apparent quantum efficiency of 12&#8201;% (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) for hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting, owing to the efficient exciton dissociation and the subsequent fast transfer of charge carriers.

         <title>Near&#8208;Equilibrium Growth of Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Framework/Graphene Oxide Hybrid Materials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;phase method has been developed for the synthesis of highly conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Vacuum filtration leads to the formation of a uniform conducting film of the COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials on a variety of substrates. The overpotential of one of the materials was as low as 45&#8197;mV in 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4 and reached a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is better than all the metal&#8208;free catalysts currently available.







Abstract
Facile synthesis and post&#8208;processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mild synthetic conditions are highly sought after and important for widespread utilizations in catalysis and energy storage. Here we report the synthesis of the chemically stable aza&#8208;fused COFs BPT&#8208;COF and PT&#8208;COF by a liquid&#8208;phase method. The process involves the spontaneous polycondensation of vicinal diamines and vicinal diketones, and is driven by the near&#8208;equilibrium growth of COF domains at a very low monomer concentration. The method permits in&#8197;situ assembly of COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials and leads to the formation of a uniform conducting film on arbitrary substrates on vacuum filtration. When used as electrocatalysts, the as&#8208;prepared membranes show a fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential (45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), which are the best among metal&#8208;free catalysts. Our results may open a new route towards the preparation of highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Dinitrogen and Nitric Oxide to Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of (electro&#8208;)chemically driven, reductive N2 splitting with nitrogen atom transfer to NO is reported. Nitrous oxide generation directly from dinitrogen and nitric oxide defines a new strategy for direct oxidative nitrogen fixation. Initial coordination of an activating NO ligand prepares the chemically robust ReV nitride for Re&#8801;N/NO radical coupling.







Abstract
Reductive splitting of N2 is an attractive strategy towards nitrogen fixation beyond ammonia at ambient conditions. However, the resulting nitride complexes often suffer from thermodynamic overstabilization hampering functionalization. Furthermore, oxidative nitrogen atom transfer of N2 derived nitrides remains unknown. We here report a ReIV pincer platform that mediates N2 splitting upon chemical reduction or electrolysis with unprecedented yield. The N2 derived ReV nitrides undergo facile nitrogen atom transfer to nitric oxide, giving nitrous oxide nearly quantitatively. Experimental and computational results indicate that outer&#8208;sphere ReN/NO radical coupling is facilitated by the activation of the nitride via initial coordination of NO.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of an Atomically Dispersed Zinc Electrocatalyst: Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible alteration of an 2&#8197;e&#8722;/4&#8197;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway was discovered by tuning the coordination environment of Zn single sites derived from MOF&#8208;5 by varying the functional group of ligands within the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursors. The formed ZnN4 follows a 4&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway, while ZnO3C achieves a maximum H2O2 production rate of 340&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Accurately regulating the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization, but challenging. A flexible alteration of ORR pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity ORR can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of the catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O&#8208; and C&#8208;coordination structure (ZnO3C) or N&#8208;coordination structure (ZnN4) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOF precursors. The coordination environment of as&#8208;prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN4 catalyst processes a 4&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway to generate H2O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO3C catalyst processes a 2&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway to generate H2O2 with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Calculations reveal that decreased electron density around Zn in ZnO3C lowers the d&#8208;band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2&#8197;e&#8722; ORR.

     alt="Tailoring the Electronic Structure of an Atomically Dispersed Zinc Electrocatalyst: Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flexible alteration of an 2&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/4&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway was discovered by tuning the coordination environment of Zn single sites derived from MOF-5 by varying the functional group of ligands within the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursors. The formed ZnN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; follows a 4&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR pathway, while ZnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C achieves a maximum H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 340&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately regulating the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization, but challenging. A flexible alteration of ORR pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity ORR can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of the catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O- and C-coordination structure (ZnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C) or N-coordination structure (ZnN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOF precursors. The coordination environment of as-prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst processes a 4&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR pathway to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C catalyst processes a 2&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR pathway to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Calculations reveal that decreased electron density around Zn in ZnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C lowers the d-band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Virus&#8208;Mimicking Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles for Cytosolic Delivery of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are engineered to express a viral fusion protein, thus enabling them to exhibit improved endosomal escape properties. It is demonstrated that these virus&#8208;mimicking nanocarriers are able to deliver mRNA payloads to the cytosolic compartment after cellular uptake, enhancing expression of the encoded proteins both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Effective endosomal escape after cellular uptake represents a major challenge in the field of nanodelivery, as the majority of drug payloads must localize to subcellular compartments other than the endosomes in order to exert activity. In nature, viruses can readily deliver their genetic material to the cytosol of host cells by triggering membrane fusion after endocytosis. For the influenza A virus, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein found on its surface fuses the viral envelope with the surrounding membrane at endosomal pH values. Biomimetic nanoparticles capable of endosomal escape were fabricated using a membrane coating derived from cells engineered to express HA on their surface. When evaluated in&#8197;vitro, these virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles were able to deliver an mRNA payload to the cytosolic compartment of target cells, resulting in the successful expression of the encoded protein. When the mRNA&#8208;loaded nanoparticles were administered in&#8197;vivo, protein expression levels were significantly increased in both local and systemic delivery scenarios. We therefore conclude that utilizing genetic engineering approaches to express viral fusion proteins on the surface of cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles is a viable strategy for modulating the intracellular localization of encapsulated cargoes.

An iron&#8208;superoxide corrole has been generated from a ferrous corrole and dioxygen, and was found to be capable of indole dioxygenation and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.







Abstract
A new structurally characterized ferrous corrole [FeII(ttppc)]&#8722; (1) binds one equivalent of dioxygen to form [FeIII(O2&#8722;.)(ttppc)]&#8722; (2). This complex exhibits a 16/18O2&#8208;isotope sensitive &#957;(O&#8208;O) stretch at 1128&#8197;cm&#8722;1 concomitantly with a single &#957;(Fe&#8208;O2) at 555&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating it is an &#951;1&#8208;superoxo (&#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221;) iron(III) complex. Complex 2 is the first well characterized Fe&#8208;O2 corrole, and mediates the following biologically relevant oxidation reactions: dioxygenation of an indole derivative, and H&#8208;atom abstraction from an activated O&#8722;H bond.

         <title>A Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Dimer of Au3 Superatoms Supported by Interlocked Tridentate Scaffolds Formed in Au18S2(SR)12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au18S2(SR)12, a new gold cluster that can be viewed as an interlocked dimer of Au9S(SR)6 cages, was synthesized using a bulky thiol ligand. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the Au6 core can be interpreted as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au3 superatoms.







Abstract
A new sulfur&#8208;containing gold cluster, Au18S2(STipb)12, was serendipitously obtained using the bulky thiol, 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzyl mercaptan (TipbSH), as protecting ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au18S2(STipb)12 has a deformed octahedral Au6 core clutched by two tridentate S[Au2(STipb)2]3 units in an interlocked manner. Based on density functional theory calculations, we propose that the Au6 core with two electrons is better viewed as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au3(1e) superatoms rather than an electronically closed Au6(2e) superatom. In situ formation of the sulfide anions (S2&#8722;) via C&#8208;S bond breakage is ascribed to the steric repulsion between the TipbS ligands.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Polymer Cyclization via Supramolecular Confinement of Cyanostilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular confinement effect facilitates cyclic polymerization of a telechelic cyanostilbene macromonomer via [2+2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition, in stark contrast to Z&#8208;E photo&#8208;isomerization in the monomeric state.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of cyclic polymers has received much attention in polymer chemistry field. Although photochemical cycloaddition of terminal &#960;&#8208;bonded units provides a plausible way toward cyclic polymerization, it remains challenging to avoid side reactions by manipulating the reaction selectivity. Herein supramolecular confinement has been developed as a promising strategy to address this issue, by introducing highly directional hydrogen bonds to the photo&#8208;reactive cyanostilbenes. The cyanostilbenes units on both ends of a telechelic macromonomer are orientationally aligned with high local concentrations, yielding [2+2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition products upon 430&#8197;nm light irradiation. It leads to the formation of cyclic polymers in the self&#8208;assembled state, in stark contrast to Z&#8208;E isomerization of cyanostilbenes in the monomeric state. Overall, supramolecular confinement effect exemplified in the current study provides new avenues toward cyclic topological polymers with high synthetic efficiency.

         <title>Emergence of a Promiscuous Peroxidase Under Non&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions**

Substrate&#8208;induced generation of a transient catalytic microphase was shown in presence of a single amino acid functionalized fatty acid and a cofactor hemin. The transient state exhibited acceleration of catalytic potential resulting in degradation of the substrate. Furthermore, latent catalytic function was displayed to hydrolyze a precursor to yield the same substrate suggesting promiscuous activity.







Abstract
Herein, we report the substrate induced generation of a transient catalytic microenvironment from a single amino acid functionalized fatty acid in presence of a cofactor hemin. The catalytic state accessed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions showed acceleration of peroxidase activity resulting in degradation of the substrate and subsequently led to disassembly. Equilibrated systems could not access the three&#8208;dimensional microphases and showed substantially lower catalytic activity. Further, the assembled state showed latent catalytic function (promiscuity) to hydrolyze a precursor to yield the same substrate. Consequently, the assembly demonstrated protometabolism by exploiting the peroxidase&#8208;hydrolase cascade to augment the lifetime and the mechanical properties of the catalytic state.

         <title>A Selective and General Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminomethylation of Olefins to Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective synthesis of amines via hydroaminomethylation of olefins in the presence of the specific Co&#8208;tert&#8208;BuPy&#8208;Xantphos catalyst is presented. This novel system is complementary to previously known noble metal catalysts and constitutes one of the most general catalysts for HAM.







Abstract
A new cobalt catalyst is presented for the domino hydroformylation&#8208;reductive amination reaction of olefins. The optimal Co&#8208;tert&#8208;BuPy&#8208;Xantphos catalyst shows good to excellent linear&#8208;to&#8208;branched (n/iso) regioselectivity for the reactions of aliphatic alkenes with aromatic amines under mild conditions. This system is far more selective than traditional cobalt(I) catalysts and even better than most known rhodium catalysts.

         <title>Leveraging the n&#8594;&#960;* Interaction in Alkene Isomerization by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fumarate to maleate (E&#8594;Z) isomerization was investigated to validate nO&#8594; &#960;C=O* interactions as a driving force for contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization. A general protocol based on selective energy transfer catalysis was developed with inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer for the conversion of diverse fumarate derivatives, including tetrasubstituted alkenes. The involvement of nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Examples of geometric alkene isomerization in nature are often limited to the net exergonic direction (&#916;G&#176;&lt;0), with the antipodal net endergonic processes (&#916;G&#176;&gt;0) comparatively under&#8208;represented. Inspired by the expansiveness of the maleate to fumarate (Z&#8594;E) isomerization in biochemistry, we investigated the inverse E&#8594;Z variant to validate nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions as a driving force for contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization. A general protocol involving selective energy transfer catalysis with inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer (&#955;max=402&#8197;nm) is disclosed. Whilst in the enzymatic process nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions commonly manifest themselves in the substrate, these same interactions are shown to underpin directionality in the antipodal reaction by shortening the product alkene chromophore. The process was validated with diverse fumarate derivatives (&gt;30 examples, up to Z:E&gt;99:1), including the first examples of tetrasubstituted alkenes, and the involvement of nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Engineering a Non&#8208;Natural Photoenzyme for Improved Photon Efficiency**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel HTS engineering platform to optimize photoenzymatic activity. The improvements in variants were correlated to an increase in enzymatic photon efficiency. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a shift from a stepwise to a concerted mechanism. The platform was expanded to improve the synthesis of &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;&#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides.







Abstract
Photoenzymes are biological catalysts that use light to convert starting materials into products. These catalysts require photon absorption for each turnover, making quantum efficiency an important optimization parameter. Flavin&#8208;dependent &#8220;ene&#8221;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) display latent photoenzymatic activity for synthetically valuable hydroalkylations; however, protein engineering has not been used to optimize this non&#8208;natural function. We describe a protein engineering platform for the high throughput optimization of photoenzymes. A single round of engineering results in improved catalytic function toward the synthesis of &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;&#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides. Mechanistic studies show that key mutations can alter the enzyme's excited state dynamics, enhance its photon efficiency, and ultimately increase catalyst performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that engineered variants display dramatically decreased radical lifetimes, indicating an evolution toward a concerted mechanism.

         <title>Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low T  g  vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds  via  thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Band&#8208;Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Bi3+/Te4+ Emitters in Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Cs2SnCl6 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent metal halides have attracted considerable attention in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting because of their superior optical properties and easy solution processibility. Herein, we report a new class of highly efficient and dual&#8208;band tunable white&#8208;light emitters based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doped perovskite derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals. Owing to the strong electron&#8722;phonon coupling and efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Te4+, the microcrystals exhibited broad dual&#8208;band white&#8208;light emission originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1 &#8594; 1S0 transitions of Bi3+ and Te4+, with good stability and a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield up to 68.3%. Specifically, a remarkable transition in Bi3+&#8208;PL lifetime from milliseconds at 10 K to microseconds at 300 K was observed, as a solid evidence for the isolated Bi3+ emission. These findings provide not only new insights into the excited&#8208;state dynamics of Bi3+ and Te4+ in Cs2SnCl6, but also a general approach to achieve single&#8208;composition white&#8208;light emitters based on lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal ion co&#8208;doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Stereo&#8208; and Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers via an Acid&#8208;Orthogonal Deprotection Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Absolute control over polymer stereo&#8208; and sequence structure, is highly challenging in polymer chemistry. Here, an acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection strategy is proposed for the iterative synthesis of a family of unimolecular polymers starting with enantiopure serines, featuring precise sequence, stereoconfiguration and side&#8208;chain functionalities that cannot be achieved using traditional polymerization techniques. Acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotections proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability. Under  p  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid, acidolysis of  tert  &#8208;butyloxycarbonyl can be proceeded exclusively, while low&#8208;dosage trifluoroacetic acid and low temperature only triggers the selective and quantitative cleavage of trityl. The pioneering use of this acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely  introduce structural and functional diversity into  stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers  , thus imparting their unique properties beyond natural biopolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit was designed and synthesized to model water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the crown ether unit of this cobalt corrole can grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions and the established water network plays vital roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to significantly boosted electrocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water&#8208;containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and 1H&#8197;NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown&#8208;ether&#8208;free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1)&#8197;external 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether to extract water molecules and 2)&#8197;potassium ion or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;n&#8208;butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water&#8208;containing networks.

         <title>Significance of Receptor Mobility in Multivalent Binding on Lipid Membranes.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous key biological processes rely on the concept of multivalency, where ligands achieve stable binding only upon engaging multiple receptors. These processes, like viral entry or immune synapse formation, occur on the diffusive cellular membrane. One crucial, yet underexplored aspect of multivalent binding is the mobility of coupled receptors. Here, we discuss the consequences of mobility in multivalent processes from four perspectives: (I) The facilitation of receptor recruitment by the multivalent ligand due to their diffusivity prior to binding. (II) The effects of receptor preassembly, which allows their local accumulation. (III) The consequences of changes in mobility upon the formation of receptor/ligand complex. (IV) The changes in the diffusivity of lipid environment surrounding engaged receptors. We demonstrate how understanding mobility is essential for fully unravelling the principles of multivalent membrane processes, leading to further development in studies on receptor interactions, and guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.</dc:description>

Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on both control experiments and extensive DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Detection of Aqueous Uranyl Based on Uranyl&#8208;Triggered Protein Photocleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of environmental uranyl is attracting increasing attention. However, the available detection strategies mainly depend on the selective recognition of uranyl, which is subject to severe interference by coexisting metal ions. Herein, based on the unique uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage property,&#160; protein&#160; BSA is labelled with fluorescent molecules that exhibit an aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect for uranyl detection. Uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage causes the separation of the fluorescent&#8208;molecule&#8208;labelled protein fragments, leading to attenuation of the emission fluorescence , which &#160;is used as a signal for uranyl detection. This detection strategy shows high selectivity for uranyl and ultralow detection limit of 24 pM with a broad detection range covering five orders of magnitude. The detection method also shows high reliability and stability, making it a promising technique for practical applications in diverse environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Inversion in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Directed by Curvature Mediated Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscale curvature&#8208;dependent interactions are of paramount importance in biological systems. Here, we report that nanoscale curvature plays an important role in regulating the chirality of self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites from chiral organic molecules and achiral nanoparticles. Specifically, we show that the supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites markedly depends on the nanoparticle curvature, where small sized nanoparticles of high curvature and large sized nanoparticles of low curvature lead to nanocomposites with opposite chirality. Quantitative kinetic experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that nanoparticle curvature plays a key role in promoting the pre&#8208;nucleation oligomerization of chiral molecules, which consequently regulates the supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites. We anticipate that this study will aid in rational design of artificial cooperative system giving rise to emergent assembling phenomena that can be surprisingly rich and often cannot be understood by studying the conventional noncooperative systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electropolymerization of Metal Clusters Establishing a Versatile Platform for Enhanced Catalysis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically&#8208;precise metal clusters are attractive as highly&#8208;efficient catalysts, but suffer from continuous efficiency deactivation in the catalytic process. Here, we report the development of an efficient strategy that enhance catalytic performance by electropolymerization (EP) of metal clusters into hybrid material. Based on carbazole ligand protection, three polymerized metal&#8208;cluster hybrid materials, namely  Poly&#8208;Cu  14  cba  ,  Poly&#8208;Cu  6  Au  6  cbz  and  Poly&#8208;Cu  6  Ag  4  cbz  , were prepared. Compared with isolated metal clusters, metal clusters immobilizing on biscarbazole network after EP significantly improved their electron&#8208;transfer ability and long&#8208;term recyclability, resulting in higher catalytic performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept,  Poly&#8208;Cu  14  cba  was evaluated as an electrocatalyst for reducing nitrate (NO  3  &#8208;  ) to ammonia (NH  3  ), which exhibited ~4&#8208;fold NH  3  yield rate and ~2&#8208;fold Faraday efficiency enhancement compared to that of  Cu  14  cba  with good durability. Similarly,  Poly&#8208;Cu  6  Au  6  cbz  showed 10&#8208;times higher photocatalytic efficiency towards chemical warfare simulants degradation than the cluster counterpart.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) radiating near ultraviolet (NUV) light are of high importance but rarely reported due to the lack of robust organic short&#8208;wavelength emitters. Here, we wish to report a shortly &#960;&#8210;conjugated molecule (POPCN&#8208;2CP) with high thermal and morphological stabilities and strong NUV photoluminescence. Its neat film exhibits an electroluminescence (EL) peak at 404 nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext,max) of 7.5% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The doped films of POPCN&#8208;2CP in both non&#8208;polar and polar hosts at a wide doping concentration range (10&#8210;80 wt%) achieve high&#8208;purity NUV light (388&#8210;404 nm) and excellent &#951;ext,maxs of up to 8.2%. The high&#8208;level reverse intersystem crossing improves exciton utilization and accounts for the superb &#951;ext,maxs. POPCN&#8208;2CP can also serve as an efficient host for blue fluorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence emitters, providing excellent EL performance via F&#246;rster energy transfer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a direct experimental observation of the torque&#8208;driven active reorientation of glucose&#8208;fueled flasklike colloidal motors to a glucose gradient exhibiting a positive chemotaxis. These streamlined flasklike colloidal motors are prepared by combining a hydrothermal synthesis and a vacuum infusion and can be propelled by enzymatic cascade reaction in the glucose fuel. Their flasklike architecture can be used to recognize their moving posture, and thus the dynamic glucose&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced alignment and orientation&#8208;dependent motility during positive chemotaxis can be examined experimentally. The chemotactic mechanism is that the enzymatic reactions inside lead to the glucose acid gradient and the glucose gradient which generate two phoretic torques at the bottom and the opening respectively, and thus continuously steer it to the glucose gradient. Such glucose&#8208;fueled flasklike colloidal motors resembling the chemotactic capability of living organisms hold considerable potential for engineering active delivery vehicles in response to specific chemical signals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst can firstly hook to bacteria and biofilm, then catalyze H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals for localized disinfection. Upon the near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, the bionanocatalyst can generate heat, which simultaneously accelerates the catalytic therapy and enables the heat ablation against bacteria.







Abstract
Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC's pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC's synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99&#8201;%. More surprisingly, the mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.

With the Ni@Co-NC's synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &amp;gt;99.99&#8201;%. More surprisingly, the mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co-NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, cell&#8208;permeable source of PdII is intracellularly reduced to the catalytically active Pd0 through the addition of sodium ascorbate. Controlled in&#8208;cell generation of Pd0 enables Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal intracellular activation of caged cytotoxic drugs and fluorophores in cancer cells.







Abstract
Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of PdII which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd0 species. Once generated, Pd0 triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of polyoxometalates (POMs) within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes is shown, demonstrating that the level of carbon oxidation and the efficacy of the filling are determined by the frontier orbital energies of the POM. Nanoencapsulation is found to confer significant stability to polyoxomolybdates despite their inherent lability.







Abstract
We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide detailed mechanistic insights into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these and similar nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8211;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86&#8201;% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles, despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, feasible, and simple approach for dynamic tunable afterglow systems based on a simple radiative energy transfer mechanism is presented. The persistent luminescent (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) can be reversibly converted between different colors in the solid, solution, and gel states by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor through a simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function relies on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with a traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.

         <title>Mesoporosity&#8208;Enabled Selectivity of Mesoporous Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals Catalysts in Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporosity engineering is demonstrated as an efficient route for boosting catalytic selectivity of Pd&#8208;based nanobundle catalysts in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of mesoporous Pd&#8208;based catalysts synergistically weaken the adsorption and binding strength of alkenes and energetically disable further over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.







Abstract
We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N to Give Colloidal Quantum Dots: Towards Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of colloidal carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;like quantum dots, C4NQDs, and their functional composites have been introduced. They show interesting fluorescence/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence dual&#8208;mode emission for advanced optical encryption. They also show edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalysis toward sulfur chemistry in Li&#8722;S cells by exploiting the functional group and edge effects of quantum dots.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C4N quantum dots (QDs) and their functional composites and explore their optical activities and edge&#8208;selective polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis. As&#8208;obtained C4NQDs are rich in carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating functionalities. While C4NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites give FL/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution to be used as an encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a barrier layer to decorate commercial separators, endowing a Li&#8722;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity. Computation and experiment studies show that edge sites in C4N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis and the enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs synergically promotecatalytic conversion of sulfur species.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) was systematically investigated on a single nanoparticle level using nanoparticle impact electrochemistry, which enables in&#8208;depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system, allowing quantitative analysis of the increased reaction possibility and the decreased activation energy. This work reveals the intrinsic physicochemical information at the nano&#8208;confined domains.







Abstract
The structure&#8211;function relationship of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalysts, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of an efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating cobalt metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOFNs) catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon&#8208;excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.

         <title>Chemically Engineered Porous Molecular Coatings as Reactive Oxygen Species Generators and Reservoirs for Long&#8208;Lasting Self&#8208;Cleaning Textiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials were prepared and used as textiles coatings to spontaneously convert absorbed oxygen from air into reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;termly store ROS in dark conditions. This work paves the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Wearable personal protective equipment that is decorated with photoactive self&#8208;cleaning materials capable of actively neutralizing biological pathogens is in high demand. Here, we developed a series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials capable of addressing this challenge. Textiles coated with these materials exhibit a broad range of functionalities, including spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;term ROS storage in dark conditions. The ROS generation and storage abilities of these materials can be further improved through chemical engineering of the precursors without altering the three&#8208;dimensional assembled superstructures. In comparison with traditional TiO2 or C3N4 self&#8208;cleaning materials, the fluorinated molecular coating material HOF&#8208;101&#8208;F shows a 10&#8208; to 60&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation and 10&#8208; to 20&#8208;fold greater ROS storage ability. Our results pave the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>A Heme&#8208;Acquisition Protein Reconstructed with a Cobalt 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation and Its Growth&#8208;Inhibition Activity Toward Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations were synthesized, and a cobalt(II) 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reconstructed protein strongly inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa and multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
Using artificial hemes for the reconstruction of natural heme proteins represents a fascinating approach to enhance the bioactivity of the latter. We report the synthesis of various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations as cofactors, and a cobalt 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesize that the oxaporphyrinium cation strongly binds to the HasA&#8208;specific outer membrane receptor (HasR) due to its cationic charge, which prevents the subsequent acquisition of heme. In fact, the reconstructed HasA inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and even of multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.

         <title>Multiple Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami nanostructures have been decorated with photosensitive reaction centers that produce reactive oxygen species at their individual characteristic wavelengths. In this way, polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine is induced and independent polymer patterning on the DNA origami template we can be directed. In addition, the polymer rings alter the interaction of DNA origami objects and cell membranes, thereby promoting their cellular uptake.







Abstract
The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multiple wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective maximum wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed method provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.

         <title>Hydrogenative Cycloisomerization and Sigmatropic Rearrangement Reactions of Cationic Ruthenium Carbenes Formed by Catalytic Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented hydrogenation reactions are disclosed, commencing with geminal delivery of both H&#8208;atoms of H2 to the triple bond of a propargyl alcohol derivative. When catalyzed with cationic ruthenium complexes, the resulting pianostool carbenes are so &#8220;hot&#8221; that they are readily intercepted by tethered nucleophiles, resulting in cycloisomerization or [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reactions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of propargyl alcohol derivatives with [CpXRu(MeCN)3]PF6 (CpX=substituted cyclopentadienyl) as catalysts affords cationic pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes which are so electrophilic that they attack a tethered olefin to furnish cyclopentene products; cyclopropanation or metathesis do not compete with this novel transformation. If the transient carbenes carry appropriate propargylic substituents, however, they engage in ([2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic) rearrangements to give enol esters (carbonates, carbamates, sulfonates) or alkenyl halides. Both pathways are unprecedented in the vast hydrogenation literature. The proposed mechanistic scenarios are in line with labeling experiments and spectroscopic data; most notably, PHIP NMR spectroscopy (PHIP=parahydrogen induced polarization) provides compelling evidence that the reactions are indeed triggered by highly unorthodox gem&#8208;hydrogenation events.

         <title>Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward molecular quantum computing, the system needs to have good coherence, scalability, and addressability. Using endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time, this work tackled the remaining two challenges by molecular modification and ensemble alignment. The refined molecular system scales up to four addressable quantum levels and enables the first implementation of geometric phase manipulation using pure electron paramagnetic resonance.







Abstract
Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of 4S3/2 has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero&#8208;field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis&#8208;addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.

         <title>12b,24b&#8208;Diborahexabenzo[a,c,fg,l,n,qr]pentacene: A Low&#8208;LUMO Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

         <dc:description>
A doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene was designed based on presynthetic DFT calculations, predicting intriguing optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, the electron&#8208;deficient, NIR&#8208;emitting B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was prepared via six net C&#8722;H borylations from an unfunctionalized alkene in a two&#8208;pot synthetic procedure. The structure obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon cyclization compared to non&#8208;fused derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron&#8208;doped nanographene. Our target boron&#8208;doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and a narrow band gap derived from its precise geometry and B&#8208;doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene (B2&#8208;HBP), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr3/AlCl3/2,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations, B2&#8208;HBP absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore, B2&#8208;HBP possesses a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V and &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc. Our methodology is surprisingly selective despite its implementation of unfunctionalized precursors and offers a new approach to the synthesis of pristine B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Biosensing with Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosensors are powerful tools for modern basic research and biomedical diagnostics. Their development requires substantial input from the chemical sciences. Sensors or probes with optical readout such as fluorescence offer rapid, minimally invasive sensing of analytes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The near infrared (NIR) is beneficial because of the reduced background and scattering of biological samples (tissue transparency window) in this range. In this context, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) have emerged as versatile NIR fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Here, we review advances of SWCNT&#8208;based NIR fluorescent molecular sensors. We review chemical design strategies for diverse analytes and summarize insights into photophysics and molecular recognition. Furthermore, different application areas are discussed from chemical imaging of cellular systems and diagnostics to&#160;  in vivo  &#160;applications and perspectives for the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 20&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products Yields Inducers of LC3 Lipidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design and synthesis of pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) through recombination of natural product (NP) fragments in unprecedented arrangements enables the discovery of novel biologically relevant chemical matter. With a view to wider coverage of NP&#8208;inspired chemical and biological space, we describe the combination of this principle with macrocycle formation. PNP&#8208;macrocycles were synthesized efficiently in a stereoselective one&#8208;pot procedure including the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of different dipolarophiles with dimeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived azomethine ylides formed in situ. The 20&#8208;membered bis&#8208;cycloadducts embody 18 stereocenters and an additional fragment&#8208;sized NP&#8208;structure. After further functionalization, a collection of 162 macrocyclic PNPs was obtained. Biological investigation revealed potent inducers of the lipidation of the microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein, which plays a prominent role in various autophagy&#8208;related processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While Mn  II  complexes meet increasing interest in biomedical applications, ligands are lacking that enable high Mn  II  complex stability and selectivity  vs  . Zn  II  , the most relevant biological competitor. We report here two new bispidine derivatives, which provide rigid and large coordination cavities that perfectly match the size of Mn  II  , yielding eight&#8208;coordinate Mn  II  complexes with record stabilities. In contrast, the smaller Zn  II  ion cannot accommodate all ligand donors, resulting in highly strained and less stable six&#8208;coordinate complexes. Combined theoretical and experimental data (X&#8208;ray crystallography, potentiometry, relaxometry and  1  H NMR spectroscopy) demonstrate unprecedented selectivity for Mn  II  vs.  Zn  II  (  K  MnL  /  K  ZnL  of 10  8  &#8208;10  10  ), in sharp contrast to the usual Irving&#8208;Williams behavior, and record Mn  II  complex stabilities and inertness with log  K  MnL  close to 25.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion with Stable Open&#8208;Shell Aromatic Nitric Acid Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is very challenging to prepare stable radicals as they are usually thermodynamically or kinetically unstable in air. Herein, a series of star&#8208;shaped aromatic nitric acid radicals were prepared via facile demethylation and consequent oxidation. As phenol radical without steric hindrance group protection, they exhibit high electrochemical and thermal stability due to its rich resonance structures including closed&#8208;shell nitro&#8208;like and open&#8208;shell nitroxide structure with unpaired electrons delocalized in conjugated backbones. Among them, TPA&#8208;TPA&#8208;O  6  powder exhibited extremely wide absorption of from 300 to 2000 nm covering the whole solar spectral irradiance, high photothermal conversion efficiency and negligible photobleaching effect in seawater desalination. Under the irradiation of one sunlight, the water evaporation efficiency of TPA&#8208;TPA&#8208;O  6  is recorded as high as 89.41% and the water evaporation rate is 1.293 kg/m  2  h, which represents&#160;the top performance in pure organic small molecule photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Selective Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Electron Transfer to Achieve Multi&#8208;Phase Transitions in an Asymmetric [Fe2Co]&#8208;Assembled Mixed&#8208;Valence Chain</title>

         <dc:description>Manipulation of multi&#8208;functions in molecular materials is promising for future switching and memory devices, although is currently difficult. Herein, we assembled the asymmetric {Fe2Co} unit into a cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#183;2CH3OH (1) (Tp = hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT = 3,4&#8211;bis&#8211;(1H&#8211;imidazol&#8211;1&#8211;yl)thiophen), which showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by the photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet property and dielectric anomalies. Variable temperature X&#8208;ray structural studies revealed thermo&#8208;and photo&#8208;induced selective electron transfer (ET) between the Co and one of the Fe ions. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that  1  displayed on and off of the single&#8208;chain magnet behavior by alternating 946&#8208;nm and 532&#8208;nm light irradiations. A substantial anomaly in dielectric constant was discovered during the electron transfer process, which is uncommon in similar ET complexes. These findings illustrate that  1  provided a new platform for multi&#8208;phase transitions and multi&#8208;switches adjusted by selective metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal ET.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Tuning Induced d&#8208;Band Center Modulation on Co&#8208;based Spinel Oxide for Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic substitutions at the tetrahedral site (A Td ) could theoretically achieve an efficient optimization of the charge at the octahedral site (B Oh ) through the A Td &#8208;O&#8208;B Oh  interactions in the spinel oxides (AB2O4). However, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and further use the spinel oxide composites (ACo2O4/NCNTs, A = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. And the optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn&#8211;air battery equipped the MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827 mAh gZn&#8208;1 with high power density of 74.63 mW cm&#8208;2 and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging&#8208;discharging rate (5 mA cm&#8208;2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the electronic structure modulated accompanied with the movement of d&#8208;band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;Co, the Co3+ Oh  of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance. This work not only proves the influence of the charge modulation mechanism on the oxygen catalysis process but also provides novel strategies for the subsequent design of other oxygen catalysis materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Liquid Crystalline Networks with Hydrogel&#8208;Like Actuation and Reconfigurable Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A porous liquid crystalline network (LCN), prepared using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures thermally induced shape change associated with LC&#8208;isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8208;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCN can be explored for versatile stimuli&#8208;triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquid, photothermal dye and fluorophore, which imparts a same porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light&#8208;driven locomotion, and emissive color.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Cell Tagging for Spatially Resolved Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OpTAG (optical cell tagging) is a novel chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. In combination with cell sorting and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq), OpTAG&#8208;seq enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for profiling gene expression of distinct cell populations at the single&#8208;cell level. However, the information of the positions of cells within the multicellular samples is missing in scRNA&#8208;seq datasets. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop OpTAG (optical cell tagging) as a new chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. With OpTAG, we establish OpTAG&#8208;seq, which enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq. We apply OpTAG&#8208;seq to investigate the spatially defined transcriptional program in migrating cancer cells and identified a list of genes that are potential regulators for cancer cell migration and invasion. OpTAG&#8208;seq provides a convenient method for mapping cellular heterogeneity with spatial information within multicellular biological systems.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Coordinated Perovskite Solar Cell with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Exceeding 1.23&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile which has C&#8801;N groups was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in perovskite films. The coordination of C&#8801;N with the lead cation was much stronger than that of the normally used C=O group. It could also reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. The device efficiency was improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;%, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V.







Abstract
In solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite films, halide&#8208;anion related defects including halide vacancies and interstitial defects can easily form at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The uncoordinated lead cations produce defect levels within the band gap, and the excess iodides disturb the interfacial carrier transport. Thus these defects lead to severe nonradiative recombination, hysteresis, and large energy loss in the device. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. The coordinating ability of cyano group was found to be stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination could reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the PAN perovskite film, the device efficiency improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;% and the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V, the ion migration activation energy increased, and operational stability improved.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable access to hypericin, a phytochemical with promising medicinal properties but low natural abundance, a strategy involving structure&#8208;based modification and organization of the microbial biosynthetic steps was developed without knowing its biosynthetic pathway in native plants. The designed consecutive reactions (see scheme) occurred in repurposed cells, thus circumventing the complex plant secondary metabolism.







Abstract
Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low in planta abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.

         <title>Preparation of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Carboxylic Acids by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Mixed Anhydrides**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids are rapidly converted into potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of their mixed anhydrides. This scalable method is compatible with a broad range of functional groups and allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic and aromatic KATs, including KATs derived from Fmoc&#8208; and Boc&#8208;protected amino acids.







Abstract
We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B2(pin)2, and aqueous KHF2. This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid&#8208;derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.

         <title>Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, representatively alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8210;BF3&#8208;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8210;Si(cat)2&#8208;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, we report another proposal using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Compared to Alkyl&#8210;BF3&#8208; and Alkyl&#8210;Si(cat)2&#8208;, Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3 show comparable activity in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3 gives the first success of group 14 tetraalkyl nucleophiles in nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes supplemented the limination of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study corresponds to the procedure that alkyl radical generates from tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also enlighten the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with metalloid center.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional&#8208;Polycyclic&#160;Photovoltaic Molecule with Low Trap Density for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical organic semiconductors show a high trap density of states (1016&#8208;1018 cm&#8208;3), providing a large number of centers for charge&#8208;carrier recombination, thus hindering the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Here, we introduce a strategy of designing and synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;polycyclic photovoltaic material, named as TPP, to reduce the trap density as low as 2.3&#215;1015 cm&#8208;3, which is 1&#8208;3 orders&#160;of&#160;magnitudes lower than those of typical organic photovoltaic semiconductors. Moreover, TPP exhibited broad and strong absorption, ordered molecular packing with large crystalline coherence length and enhanced electron mobility. Then, the bulk heterojunction nanoparticles (BHJ&#8208;NPs) based on the blend of polymer donor (PM6) and TPP, exhibited an average hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 72.75 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, which is higher than that of the control NPs based on typical PM6:Y6 (62.67 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) tested under 330&#8208;1100 nm illumination with light intensity of 198 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller&#8208;like conformation through substitution at the 2,6&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.







Abstract
New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.

&lt;p&gt;Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller-like conformation through substitution at the 2,6-positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep-blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6-position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep-blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep-blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly Curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave&#8211;convex interactions between of negatively and positively curved molecular nanographene with C60 allow the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms solvent dependent electron transfer after photo&#8208;excitation.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular complexes between C60 and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by 1H&#8197;NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale showed that the addition of C60 to NG&#8208;1 solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460&#8197;nm leads to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of the one&#8208;electron reduced form of C60 in benzonitrile was observed.

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins with multiple pyrene units exhibited bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Owing to their good molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8208;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5), the CPL brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1.







Abstract
We report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CyD) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8211;cyclodextrins (PCDs) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8722;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photophysical and chiroptical studies of the PCDs with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the CyD with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the synthesis of amides and peptides is reported. Synergistic cooperation between a cobaloxime and a photoredox catalyst removes the elements of H2O through the use of PPh3 as a gentle organic reductant. The deoxygenative method is compatible with gram&#8208;scale peptide synthesis and applicable to peptide fragment condensation and SPPS, which may find applications in both organic synthesis and pharmaceutical production.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.

         <title>Optimized Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable Crystalline Poly(Triazine Imide) with Minimized Defects for OLED Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) is a member of the family of graphitic carbon nitrides and its graphitic morphology allows exfoliation of the material into thin, solution&#8208;processable layers, while at the same time reducing migration and drift of chemically bonded dopants. A team of researchers from King's College London, Humboldt&#8208;Universit&#228;t zu Berlin, Carl von Ossietzky Universit&#228;t Oldenburg, and Helmholtz&#8208;Zentrum Berlin (HZB) constructed the first thin layer, organic light emitting device (OLED) with a solution&#8208;processed graphitic organic material as a metal&#8208;free emission layer. For details see the Research Article by Michael&#8197;J. Bojdys et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111749).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic binary phosphazene/TEB system is highly active and selective toward ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxides to prepare diverse CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs). In their Research Article(DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111197), Shaofeng Liu, Zhibo Li et&#8197;al. report that this metal&#8208;free organocatalyst can efficiently copolymerize CO2 with cyclohexene oxide under ambient conditions (1 atm pressure and room temperature), which is an environmental&#8208;friendly and more carbon&#8208;balanced way toward utilization of CO2.

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;to&#8208;adsorbent&#8208;based sorting of fine particles, including cells, is engineered by minimizing the masking effect of non&#8208;specific interactions. Due to a high contact area and hence high detachment energy, even non&#8208;specifically and weakly interacting particulates are quasi&#8208;irreversibly bound to adsorbents. Microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic interfaces provide a solution for sorting highly asymmetric cell and particle mixtures.







Abstract
The mechanism of separation methods, for example, liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions kT, required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few kT for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up&#8208;conversion nanoparticles and MnII&#8208;based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual&#8208;color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting.







Abstract
In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+,Yb3+ as core and a CsMnCl3 as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;initiating frustrated Lewis pairs promoted compounded sequence control to achieve one&#8208;step synthesis of the well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit much superior mechanical properties to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs and maintain TPEs properties at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091&#8201;%, tensile strength up to 11.5&#8197;MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95&#8201;% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100&#8201;% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.

         <title>Watching Microwave&#8208;Induced Microscopic Hot Spots via the Thermosensitive Fluorescence of Europium/Terbium Mixed&#8208;Metal Organic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;induced micro&#8208;hot spots were detected in liquid solutions through fluorescence thermometers attached on microwave&#8208;absorbing carbon particles. The fluorescent experiments confirmed the established microwave&#8208;irradiated energy&#8208;transfer model, whose results can guide precise control and optimization of conditions in microwave chemistry.







Abstract
The hypothesis of microscopic hot spots is widely used to explain the unique microwave (MW) effect in materials science and chemical engineering, but it has not yet been directly measured. Herein we use Eu/Tb mixed&#8208;metal organic complexes as nano thermometers to probe the intrinsic temperature of MW&#8208;absorbing particles in MW fields based on the thermosensitive fluorescent spectra. According to the measurements of the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interphase, we derive an MW&#8208;irradiated energy transfer model to predict the extent of microscopic hot spots. The fluorescence results agree with the model predictions that the MW&#8208;induced temperature gradient can be enlarged by increasing MW intensity, as well as the dielectric loss and size of particles. Conversely, the increase in the thermal conductivity and the dielectric loss of the liquid lowers the temperature gradient. This study enables control of MW&#8208;assisted synthesis and MW&#8208;responsive techniques.

         <title>Microfluidic Fabrication of Hierarchical&#8208;Ordered ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx Core&#8211;Sheath Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx core&#8211;sheath fibers have been developed by microfluidic assembly and microchannel reaction methods. Due to an in situ Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn bonding bridge, well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity and fast interfacial charge transfer, supercapacitors deliver high energy density, large capacitance, long&#8208;term stability and natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8211;sheath fibers, in which a ZIF&#8722;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), excellent capacitance (854&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20&#8201;000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO4 electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton&#8208;based battery chemistry.







Abstract
All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H2SO4) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H+ for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H+ intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H+ uptake/removal in the ZnSO4 electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of finned ferrierite produces a zeolite with reduced mass transport limitations, thereby enhancing its catalyst lifetime and increasing its selectivity to isobutene in tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.







Abstract
Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12&#8201;% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.

         <title>Smart Nano&#8208;PROTACs Reprogram Tumor Microenvironment for Activatable Photo&#8208;metabolic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) are developed for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. SPNCOX&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, leading to the depletion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.







Abstract
Protease inhibitors can modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off&#8208;targeted side effects. We report smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer&#8208;specific protein degradation to reprogram the TME for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano&#8208;PROTAC has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with a cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX&#8208;1/2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) via a cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. CPP can be activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB to induce the degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 depletes their metabolite prostaglandin E2 which is responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Such a smart PROTAC strategy synergized with phototherapy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity.

         <title>Collateral Damage Occurs When Using Photosensitizer Probes to Detect or Modulate Nucleic Acid Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of DNA/RNA impact their properties including susceptibility to oxidation. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and N6&#8208;methyladenine were competed for photooxidation by riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal against dA, dG, dC, and dT in DNA. This confirmed dG is more oxidation prone, representing collateral damage during photosensitized probing for the base methylations.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are chemically modified to fine&#8208;tune their properties for biological function. Chemical tools for selective tagging of base modifications enables new approaches; the photosensitizers riboflavin and anthraquinone were previously proposed to oxidize N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A) or 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mdC) selectively. Herein, riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal were allowed to react with the canonical nucleosides dA, dC, dG, and dT, and the modified bases 5mdC, m6A, 8&#8208;oxoguanine (dOG), and 8&#8208;oxoadenine (dOA) to rank their reactivities. The nucleoside studies reveal that dOG is the most reactive and that the native nucleoside dG is higher or similar in reactivity to 5mdC or m6A; competition in both single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA of dG vs. 5mdC or 6mdA for oxidant confirmed that dG is favorably oxidized. Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.

Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Characterization and Protein Engineering of a Triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosyltransferase Reveal a Conserved Residue Critical for the Regiospecificity</title>

         <dc:description>
We characterized the first plant cycloartane glycosyltransferase AmGT8 from A. membranaceus. Its mutants A394F, A394D, and T131V were discovered using semi&#8208;rational design, which showed specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation activities, respectively. This study uncovered a conserved residue critical for the regiospecificity of plant glycosyltransferases.







Abstract
Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the C&#8208; and O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.

         <title>Two Giant Calixarene&#8208;Like Polyoxoniobate Nanocups {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} Built from Mixed Macrocyclic Cluster Motifs</title>

         <dc:description>
Calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobates: Two unprecedented giant calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobate (PONb) nanocups based on multiple macrocyclic clusters have been made, showing the fusion of two areas of metallacalixarene and PONb chemistry. The two molecular nanocups are by far the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs and hold promise for developing largely unexplored inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONb chemistry.







Abstract
Cup&#8208;shaped molecules are of great interest due to their appealing architectures and properties. Compared with widely studied calixarenes, polyoxometalate&#8208;based cup&#8208;shaped molecules currently remain a virgin land waiting for exploration. In this work, we report the first discovery of two giant cup&#8208;shaped inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs) of {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128}. The former integrates three tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a hexacyclic Nb48 cluster into a cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a Cu12 metallacalixarene, while the latter unifies two tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a brand&#8208;new pentacyclic Nb40 cluster into another cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a hybrid Cd16 unit. With 132 and 144 metal centers, {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} show the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs known to date.

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8208;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification procedure on a 15&#8208;component building block of achiral Ln24Ti8 wheel&#8208;like assemblies has been developed to obtain new accessible building blocks, resulting in a pair of new chiral enantiomers in elusive Ln&#8211;Ti systems.







Abstract
Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multi&#8208;component building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA=salicylic acid, Ln=Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA=5&#8208;methoxysalicylic acid, x=1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8722; unit makes the originally variable Ln chains become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto&#8208;optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amides via Highly Chemoselective N&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation is reported. The protocol advances the biorelevant amide bond cross&#8208;coupling manifold to solid&#8208;state solventless cross&#8208;coupling methods.







Abstract
Although cross&#8208;coupling reactions of amides by selective N&#8722;C cleavage are one of the most powerful and burgeoning areas in organic synthesis due to the ubiquity of amide bonds, the development of mechanochemical, solid&#8208;state methods remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation. The method is conducted in the absence of external heating, for short reaction time and shows excellent chemoselectivity for &#963; N&#8722;C bond activation. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs and sequential orthogonal cross&#8208;couplings exploiting double solventless solid&#8208;state methods. The results extend mechanochemical reaction environments to advance the chemical repertoire of N&#8722;C bond interconversions to solid&#8208;state environmentally friendly mechanochemical methods.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxazaborolidines by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H Double Activation of 1,2&#8208;Azaborines</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;azaborines has been demonstrated. A wide variety of 1,2&#8208;azaborines underwent cycloaddition with vinylethylene carbonate through N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H bond cleavage to produce unique polycyclic oxazaborolidines under mild conditions. Furthermore, highly enantioselective direct functionalization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines afforded chiral tricyclic oxazaborolidines.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines proceeded via cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonate to produce polycyclic oxazaborolidines in 31&#8211;96&#8201;% yield. The key step in this process is the release of molecular hydrogen from a borate intermediate. Using a SPINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidite as a chiral ligand, chiral oxazaborolidines were synthesized in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The vinyl group of the resulting oxazaborolidine underwent metathesis, Heck reaction, and Wacker oxidation without affecting the oxazaborolidine framework.

         <title>Surface Engineering Assisted Size and Structure Modulation of Gold Nanoclusters by Ionic Liquid Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid cations are deployed to regulate the size and structure of AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. Upon mild reduction, such AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes can be easily converted into desired AuI&#8208;thiolate protecting motifs, selectively producing atomically precise gold nanoclusters with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry.







Abstract
Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize the desired Au0 core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.

         <title>Relating Conformational Equilibria to Conformer&#8208;Specific Lipophilicities: New Opportunities in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catching conformations: Lipophilicity (logP) is a molecular property which is nevertheless the weighted average of the lipophilicities of the individual conformers. The first direct measurement of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicity values is presented, together with the introduction of a new avenue for rational lipophilicity optimization of drug candidates which is focused on modification of conformational equilibria in water and in octanol.







Abstract
Efficient drug discovery is based on a concerted effort in optimizing bioactivity and compound properties such as lipophilicity, and is guided by efficiency metrics that reflect both aspects. While conformation&#8211;activity relationships and ligand conformational control are known strategies to improve bioactivity, the use of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicities (logp) is much less explored. Here we show how conformer&#8208;specific logp values can be obtained from knowledge of the macroscopic logP value, and of the equilibrium constants between the individual species in water and in octanol. This is illustrated with fluorinated amide rotamers, with integration of rotamer 19F NMR signals as a facile, direct method to obtain logp values. The difference between logp and logP optimization is highlighted, giving rise to a novel avenue for lipophilicity control in drug discovery.

         <title>Ordered PtFeIr Intermetallic Nanowires Prepared through a Silica&#8208;Protection Strategy for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowires supported on commercial carbon were synthesized. Coating with SiO2 and the addition of Ir enabled the integrity of the nanowire structure to be maintained during their transformation from a disordered fcc&#8208;phase to an ordered fct&#8208;phase. The fct&#8208;phase nanowires exhibited much better ORR activity and structural and electrochemical stability than the fcc&#8208;phase ones.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is a way to promote the large&#8208;scale application of fuel cells. Pt&#8208;based alloy nanowires are promising ORR catalysts, but their application is hampered by activity loss caused by structural destruction during long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, the preparation of ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowire catalysts with an average diameter of 2.6&#8197;nm and face&#8208;centered tetragonal structure (fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C) is reported. A silica&#8208;protected strategy prevents the deformation of PtFeIr nanowires during the phase transition at high temperature. The as&#8208;prepared fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C exhibited superior mass activity for ORR (2.03&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) than disordered PtFeIr nanowires with face&#8208;centered cubic structure (1.11&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and commercial Pt/C (0.21&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). Importantly, the structure and electrochemical performance of fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C were maintained after stability tests, showing the advantages of the ordered structure.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Lithium Conducting Polymers with High Ionic Conductivity Based on Borate Pendant Groups</title>

         <dc:description>
A new family of lithium&#8208;conducting methacrylic polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is discussed. The optimized borate homopolymer shows the highest ionic conductivity reported for a single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte for lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
A family of single&#8208;ion lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is reported. The effect of the nature of the substituents on the boron atom on the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single&#8208;ion conducting homopolymer (1.65&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C). This together with its high lithium transference number t
=0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2&#8197;V vs Li0/Li+ show promise for application in lithium batteries. To illustrate this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into a single&#8208;ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (&lt;0.85&#8197;V at &#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 175&#8197;h).

&lt;p&gt;A new family of lithium-conducting methacrylic polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is discussed. The optimized borate homopolymer shows the highest ionic conductivity reported for a single-ion conducting polymer electrolyte for lithium metal batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family of single-ion lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is reported. The effect of the nature of the substituents on the boron atom on the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electron-withdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single-ion conducting homopolymer (1.65&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C). This together with its high lithium transference number &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
=0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2&#8197;V vs Li&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; show promise for application in lithium batteries. To illustrate this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into a single-ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (&amp;lt;0.85&#8197;V at &#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 175&#8197;h).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TMSCF2Br&#8208;Enabled Fluorination&#8211;Aminocarbonylation of Aldehydes: Modular Access to &#945;&#8208;Fluoroamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines has been developed, in which the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) is the key to the success of this multicomponent process.







Abstract
A protocol for the modular assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8211;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the in situ formed TMS&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potion from the ocean: New peptide antibiotics from a sponge&#8208;derived bacterium are reported, featuring chlorination and an unusual amino&#8208;capped C&#8208;terminus. Studies on isolation, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, total synthesis, and structure&#8211;activity relationships are presented.







Abstract
Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium Aquimarina sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarin residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore is chemically introduced into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also have excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics.







Abstract
In nature, many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechano&#8208;chromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.

         <title>K&#8208;Chabazite Zeolite Nanocrystal Aggregates for Highly Efficient Methane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed iteration method to synthesis macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) aggregates with enhanced mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity of CH4 to effectively separate CH4/N2 is reported, which has significant potential for low&#8208;concentrated coalbed methane enrichment.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) enrichment and purification is of great significance for increasing the heating value of unconventional natural gas sources and curtailing its effect on global warming. For a long time, commercial adsorbents for CH4 separation have been hampered by low adsorption capacities, sub&#8208;optimal adsorption selectivities, or slow diffusion rates, which have significantly restricted separation productivity. Herein, we report a facile and green seed&#8208;passaging method to fabricate donut&#8208;like macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical zeolite K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal aggregates. This consecutive seed&#8208;inducing method requires no organic template. By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH4 adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH4/N2 separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled&#8208;up to the order of 100&#8197;kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.

         <title>Circular Permutated PQQ&#8208;Glucose Dehydrogenase as an Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circular permutation of PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase creates an artificial allosteric enzyme controlled by ligand binding to N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal domains. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.







Abstract
Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ&#8208;GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ&#8208;GDH that show large (&gt;10&#8208;fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N&#8208; and C termini by ligand binding domain/ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.

     alt="Circular Permutated PQQ-Glucose Dehydrogenase as an Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Biosensor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular permutation of PQQ-glucose dehydrogenase creates an artificial allosteric enzyme controlled by ligand binding to N- and C-terminal domains. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub-nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ-glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ-GDH that show large (&amp;gt;10-fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N- and C termini by ligand binding domain/ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub-nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays. For instance, the concentration of Cyclosporine&#8197;A could be measured in 1&#8197;&#956;L of undiluted blood with the same accuracy as the leading diagnostic technique that uses 50 times more sample. We further used this biosensor to construct highly porous gold bioelectrodes capable of robustly detecting concentrations of Cyclosporine&#8197;A as low as 20&#8197;pM and retained functionality in samples containing at least 60&#8201;% human serum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical mechanical responses, from elastic and elasto&#8208;plastic bending to exceptional malleability, have been realized at different stress and temperature conditions in crystals of a rhenium oxyacid salt. The extent of the molecular rotations/translations in the mechanism is governed by the crystal structure.







Abstract
Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of a dynamic crystal (1), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two&#8208;face elasticity (within &#8776;1&#8201;% strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at room temperature. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at &#8776;105&#8201;&#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#956;&#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in the rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.

         <title>An Activatable Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanocomposite as Early Evaluation System of Therapy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;vivo &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; NIR&#8208;II FL and NIR&#8208;II PA signals by using activated caspases&#8208;3 after radiotherapy to proteolytically cleave the peptide sequence of an AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048 nanoprobe, in addition to integrating living imaging information with a radiotherapy effect using the caspase&#8208;3 enzyme as &#8220;matchmaker&#8221; and developing the relationship between each other, achieves real&#8208;time evaluation and early prediction of radiotherapy effects.







Abstract
Delays in evaluating cancer response to radiotherapy (RT) usually reduce therapy effect or miss the right time for treatment optimization. Hence, exploring timely and accurate methods enabling one to gain insights of RT response are highly desirable. In this study, we have developed an apoptosis enzyme (caspase&#8208;3) activated nanoprobe for early evaluation of RT efficacy. The nanoprobe bridged the nanogapped gold nanoparticles (AuNNPs) and the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) molecules (IR&#8208;1048) through a caspase&#8208;3 specific peptide sequence (DEVD) (AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048). After X&#8208;ray irradiation, caspase&#8208;3 was activated to cut DEVD, turning on both NIR&#8208;II FL and PA imaging signals. The increased NIR&#8208;II FL/PA signals exhibited a positive correlation with the content of caspase&#8208;3. Moreover, the amount of the activated caspase&#8208;3 was negatively correlated with the tumor size. The results underscore the role of the caspase&#8208;3 activated by X&#8208;ray irradiation in bridging the imaging signals variation and tumor inhibition rate. Overall, activatable NIR&#8208;II FL/PA imaging was successfully used to timely predict and evaluate the RT efficacy. The evaluation system based on biomarker&#8208;triggered living imaging has the capacity to guide treatment decisions for numerous cancer types.

Half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via &#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aldimines and alkenes with broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208;, diastereoselectivity and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency.







Abstract
Here we report for the first time the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of a wide range of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via the activation of an unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol offers a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aliphatic aldimines and alkenes. The annulation of aldimines with styrenes exclusively afforded the 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity through the 2,1&#8208;insertion of a styrene unit. The annulation of aldimines with aliphatic alkenes selectively gave the 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane products in a 1,2&#8208;insertion fashion. A catalytic amount of an appropriate amine such as adamantylamine (AdNH2) or dibenzylamine (Bn2NH) showed significant effects on the catalyst activity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of amino/nitro&#8208;cyclopropylalanine moieties in hormaomycin and belactosin was fully elucidated. The pathway involves six&#8208;electron oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine by heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes (HrmI/BelK) and C&#8722;C bond formation by iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases (HrmJ/BelL). This is the first example of Fe/&#945;&#8208;KG oxygenase&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropane formation.







Abstract
Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes, hrmI/belK and hrmJ/belL, were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine to afford l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine.

     alt="Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biosynthetic pathway of amino/nitro-cyclopropylalanine moieties in hormaomycin and belactosin was fully elucidated. The pathway involves six-electron oxidation of the &#1013;-amino group of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine by heme oxygenase-like dinuclear iron enzymes (HrmI/BelK) and C&#8722;C bond formation by iron- and &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (HrmJ/BelL). This is the first example of Fe/&#945;-KG oxygenase-catalyzed cyclopropane formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes, &lt;i&gt;hrmI&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;belK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;hrmJ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;belL&lt;/i&gt;, were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase-like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#1013;-amino group of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine to afford &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-6-nitronorleucine. Subsequently, HrmJ and BelL, which are iron- and &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, effectively convert &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-6-nitronorleucine into 3-(&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2-nitrocyclopropyl)-alanine through C4&#8722;C6 bond installation. These observations disclose a novel pathway of cyclopropane ring construction and exemplify the new chemistry involving metalloenzymes in natural product biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probes for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels In&#8197;Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a general energy balance approach by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized platform, the first dual&#8208;ratio NIRF/PA response probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2 was designed for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels in vivo.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual&#8208;ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia in&#8197;vivo. AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene&#8208;hemicyanine (AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;1) and a 4&#8208;nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10&#8208;fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I773/I733) and 2.4&#8208;fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA730/PA670) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified the hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for the dual ratiometric imaging of other disease&#8208;relevant biomarkers.

         <title>Atomic Bridging Structure of Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bridging structure of nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon active sites confined in channel&#8208;rich porous carbon fibers enables the highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.







Abstract
To meet strategic applications, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemical molecules would be improved by the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed active sites. Herein an electrospun&#8208;pyrolysis cooperative strategy is presented to not only modulate the porous structure of the carbon support for favorable charge and mass transfer, but also adjust the bridging structure of atomically dispersed metal species. Typically, the experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique chemical structure of binuclear nickel bridging with nitrogen and carbon atoms (namely Ni2&#8722;N4&#8722;C2) tunes the electronic nature of the d&#8208;states for the optimal adsorption of carbon dioxide and intermediates, thus inducing the substantial enhancement of CO2 reduction via the thermodynamically more favorable pathway. The identification of such a structure demonstrates the large space to modulate the atomic bridging status for optimizing electrocatalysis.

         <title>The Crystal Plane is not the Key Factor for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methane Electrosynthesis on Reconstructed Cu2O Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;depth mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on in&#8197;situ reconstructed Cu2O microparticles is still ambiguous. Now strong evidence shows that the Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane production rather than the initial crystal planes of the Cu2O microparticles.







Abstract
Cu2O microparticles with controllable crystal planes and relatively high stability have been recognized as a good platform to understand the mechanism of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane formation, rather than the initial crystal plane of the reconstructed Cu2O microparticles. Experimental results indicate that the methane evolution is dominated on all three different crystal planes with similar Tafel slopes and long&#8208;term stabilities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that *CO is protonated via a similar bridge configuration at the Cu2O/Cu interface, regardless of the initial crystal planes of Cu2O. The Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of *CHO on different reconstructed Cu2O planes are close and more negative than that of *OCCOH, indicating the methane formation is more favorable than ethylene on all Cu2O crystal planes.

         <title>Formation of Super&#8208;Assembled TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Inverse Opal Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (TZNC IO) structure is designed through a multi&#8208;step method to regulate Zn deposition for Zn metal anodes. Benefitting from the ordered open structure with abundant zincophilic sites, the TZNC host can realize a preferential Zn nucleation and growth in the confined space. As expected, the dendrite&#8208;free TZNC@Zn composite anode enables long&#8208;term cycling in both symmetric and full cells.







Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions are the major restrictions for the commercialization of Zn metal anodes. Herein, we develop a TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (denoted as TZNC IO) host to regulate the Zn deposition. Amorphous TiOx and Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon can serve as the zincophilic nucleation sites to prevent the parasitic reactions. More importantly, the highly ordered IO host homogenizes the local current density and electric field to stabilize Zn deposition. Furthermore, the three&#8208;dimensional open networks could regulate Zn ion flux to enable stable cycling performance at large current densities. Owing to the abundant zincophilic sites and the open structure, granular Zn deposits could be realized. As expected, the TZNC IO host guarantees the steady Zn plating/stripping with a long&#8208;term stability over 450&#8197;h at the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a TZNC@Zn||V2O5 full cell shows long lifespan over 2000&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.
