         <title>Infrared Multiphoton Dissociation Enables Top&#8208;Down Characterization of Membrane Protein Complexes and G Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are challenging to analyze by native mass spectrometry (MS) as their hydrophobic nature typically requires detergent micelles that are removed prior to analysis via collisional activation. There is however a practical limit to the amount of energy which can be applied, which often precludes subsequent characterization by top&#8208;down MS. To overcome this barrier, we have applied a modified Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to an infrared laser within a high&#8208;pressure linear ion trap. We show how tuning the intensity and time of incident photons enables liberation of membrane proteins from detergent micelles. Specifically, we relate the ease of micelle removal to the infrared absorption of detergents in both condensed and gas phases. Top&#8208;down MS via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), results in good sequence coverage enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes. By contrasting and comparing the fragmentation patterns of the ammonia channel with two class A GPCRs, we identify successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids within transmembrane domains. Using gas&#8208;phase molecular dynamics simulations, we show that areas prone to fragmentation maintain aspects of protein structure at increasing temperatures. Altogether, we propose a rationale to explain why and where in the protein fragment ions are generated.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward a Formyl&#8208;to&#8208;Phenyl Conversion: An Unexpected Photochemical Fulvene&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toward a conversion of aldehydes into arenes, we designed a sequence involving the initial reaction of an aldehyde to give a fulvene, followed by photochemical and platinum&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements into a Dewar benzene&#8208;derivative, which finally isomerizes into the targeted arene. While computational studies support the plausibility of this route, we find that fulvene irradiation resulted in an unexpected isomerization into a spiro[2.4]heptadiene. This unusual photorearrangement has been investigated mechanistically and provides access to a variety of spiro[2.4]heptadienes with different substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction through Water Structure Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past, the design of efficient electrocatalyst materials for alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) were mostly focused on tuning the adsorption properties of reaction intermediates. A recent breakthrough shows that the performance can be improved by manipulating water structure at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface using atomically localized electric fields. Such effect was realized on IrRu Dizygotic Single&#8208;Atom Sites (DSAC), which shows significantly accelerated water dissociation and improved alkaline HER performance. Supported by extensive data from advanced modelling, characterization, and electrochemical measurement, the work delivers an intricate examination of the interaction between water molecules and the catalyst surface, thereby enriching our understanding of water dissociation kinetics and proposing new insights to boost overall alkaline HER efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Redox&#8208;Neutral&#160;Thiolation  of Alkyl Halides with Thioformates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as an important strategy to furnish thioethers; however, the dominant utilization of noble metal catalysts as well as the construction of challenging C(sp3)&#8208;S bonds by transition metal&#8208;catalysis remain highly problematic. Earth&#8208;abundant manganese has gathered increasing interest as an attractive catalyst for new reaction development; nevertheless, C(sp3)&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reaction by manganese catalysis has not been reported. Herein, we disclose a highly efficient manganese&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral thiolation of a broad range of alkyl halides with thioformates as practical sulfuration agents. Strategically, employing easily synthesized thioformates as thiyl radical precursors allows access to various aryl and alkyl thioethers in good to excellent yields. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral method avoids the utilization of strong bases, external ligands, forcing reaction conditions, and stoichiometric manganese, thus presenting apparent advantages, such as broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and mild reaction conditions. Finally, the utilities of this method are also illustrated by downstream transformations and late&#8208;stage thiolation of structurally complex natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>When High&#8208;Temperature Cesium Chemistry Meets Self&#8208;Templating: Metal Acetates as Building Blocks of Unusual Highly Porous Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon with a large specific surface area of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 is obtained by highly facile and straightforward pyrolysis of cesium acetate. The unique role of CsAc is revealed as a precursor, catalyst, physical template, and activating agent during the whole process.







Abstract
Self&#8208;templating is a facile strategy for synthesizing porous carbons by direct pyrolysis of organic metal salts. However, the method typically suffers from low yields (&lt;4%) and limited specific surface areas (SSA&lt;2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) originating from low activity of metal cations (e.g., K+ or Na+) in promoting construction and activation of carbon frameworks. Here we use cesium acetate as the only precursor of oxo&#8208;carbons with large SSA of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, tunable oxygen contents, and yields of up to 15&#8201;%. We unravel the role of Cs+ as an efficient promoter of framework formation, templating and etching agent, while acetates act as carbon/oxygen sources of carbonaceous frameworks. The oxo&#8208;carbons show record&#8208;high CO2 uptake of 8.71&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an ultimate specific capacitance of 313&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the supercapacitor. This study helps to understand and rationally tailor the materials design by a still rare organic solid&#8208;state chemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Cationic Defects Coupling with Local Alkaline&#8208;Enriched Environment for Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density cationic defects coupling with local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment were developed to inhibit the dissolution of highly active species during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. A higher concentration of alkaline around cationic defects than bulk electrolyte enables ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8722; ions. This novel strategy greatly enhances the stability and improves the activity.







Abstract
The inferior activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limit their practical applications in various electrochemical energy conversion systems. Here we report, a drastic nonequilibrium precipitation approach to construct a highly disordered crystal structure of layered double hydroxides as a model OER catalyst. The unconventional crystal structure contains high&#8208;density cationic defects coupled with a local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment, enabling ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8722; ions and thus avoiding the formation of a local acidic environment and dissolution of active sites during OER. An integrated experimental and theoretical study reveals that high&#8208;density cationic defects, especially di&#8208;cationic and multi&#8208;cationic defects, serve as highly active and durable catalytic sites.

     alt="High-Density Cationic Defects Coupling with Local Alkaline-Enriched Environment for Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-density cationic defects coupling with local alkaline-enriched environment were developed to inhibit the dissolution of highly active species during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. A higher concentration of alkaline around cationic defects than bulk electrolyte enables ultrafast diffusion of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This novel strategy greatly enhances the stability and improves the activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferior activity and stability of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limit their practical applications in various electrochemical energy conversion systems. Here we report, a drastic nonequilibrium precipitation approach to construct a highly disordered crystal structure of layered double hydroxides as a model OER catalyst. The unconventional crystal structure contains high-density cationic defects coupled with a local alkaline-enriched environment, enabling ultrafast diffusion of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions and thus avoiding the formation of a local acidic environment and dissolution of active sites during OER. An integrated experimental and theoretical study reveals that high-density cationic defects, especially di-cationic and multi-cationic defects, serve as highly active and durable catalytic sites. This work showcases a promising strategy of crystal structure engineering to construct robust active sites for high-performance oxygen evolution in an alkaline solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CuNi Nanoalloys with Tunable Composition and Oxygen Defects for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of Cu to bimetallic CuNi nanoalloys of tunable composition and size promotes the catalytic activity in the electrochemical Oxygen Evolution reaction and the formation of Ni3+ under reaction conditions. The experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations showed that the relative amount between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) is an excellent descriptor of the catalytic performance in alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni3+ sites under reaction conditions. The ratio OV/OL between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu50Ni50NP showed the lowest overpotential (318&#8197;mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Targeted Glycan Editing on Living Cells Disrupts KRAS Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;targeted glycan editing strategy is developed for interfering with KRAS activity by manipulating the glycosylation of upstream membrane receptors. The attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 blocks its binding with galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes.







Abstract
The frequent mutation of KRAS oncogene in some of the most lethal human cancers has spurred incredible efforts to develop KRAS inhibitors, yet only one covalent inhibitor for the KRASG12C mutant has been approved to date. New venues to interfere with KRAS signaling are desperately needed. Here, we report a &#8220;localized oxidation&#8208;coupling&#8221; strategy to achieve protein&#8208;specific glycan editing on living cells for disrupting KRAS signaling. This glycan remodeling method exhibits excellent protein and sugar specificity and is applicable to different donor sugars and cell types. Attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3, a membrane receptor upstream of KRAS, blocks its binding to galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes. Our work represents the first successful attempt to interfere with KRAS activity by manipulating membrane receptor glycosylation.

         <title>Toward Complete Transformation of Sodium Polysulfides by Regulating the Second&#8208;Shell Coordinating Environment of Atomically Dispersed Fe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed N, S&#8208;coordinated Fe catalysts are anchored into porous carbon nanofibers as hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The introduction of second&#8208;shell S atoms modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, thus enhancing the catalytic activity for promoting complete transformation of active S species, while realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na deposition.







Abstract
Room temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are highly competitive as potential energy storage devices. Nevertheless, their actually achieved reversible capacities are far below the theoretical value due to incomplete transformation of polysulfides. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N/S active center by regulating the second&#8208;shell coordinating environment of Fe single atom is proposed. The Fe&#8722;N4S2 coordination structure with enhanced local electronic concentration around the Fermi level is revealed via synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations, which can not only significantly promote the transformation kinetics of polysulfides, but induce uniform Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the obtained S cathode delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 1590&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly the theoretical value. This work opens up a new avenue to facilitate the complete transformation of polysulfides for RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Carboxysome&#8208;Inspired Electrocatalysis using Enzymes for the Reduction of CO2 at Low Concentrations
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired approach using enzyme electrocatalysis for the efficient direct reduction of CO2 at low concentrations to formate using Carbonic Anhydrase co&#8208;immobilized with Formate Dehydrogenase in a mesoporous indium tin oxide electrode is described.







Abstract
The electrolysis of dilute CO2 streams suffers from low concentrations of dissolved substrate and its rapid depletion at the electrolyte&#8208;electrocatalyst interface. These limitations require first energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture and concentration, before electrolyzers can achieve acceptable performances. For direct electrocatalytic CO2 reduction from low&#8208;concentration sources, we introduce a strategy that mimics the carboxysome in cyanobacteria by utilizing microcompartments with nanoconfined enzymes in a porous electrode. A carbonic anhydrase accelerates CO2 hydration kinetics and minimizes substrate depletion by making all dissolved carbon available for utilization, while a highly efficient formate dehydrogenase reduces CO2 cleanly to formate; down to even atmospheric concentrations of CO2. This bio&#8208;inspired concept demonstrates that the carboxysome provides a viable blueprint for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 streams to chemicals by using all forms of dissolved carbon.

         <title>High Dielectric Poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;Based Polymer Enables Uniform Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport in Solid&#8208;State Ionogel Electrolytes</title>

The P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE) shows lower adsorption energy on Pyr13+ from ionic liquids (ILs) than PVDF, which reduces the chance for Pyr13+ to occupy transport sites of Li+ and lower the Li+ migration barrier. In consequence, the Li+ transport in polymer phases is promoted, which narrows the gap of Li+ mobility between polymer phases with ILs and polymer&#8208;ILs interfaces, contributing to uniform Li+ flux to inhibit the lithium dendrites&#8217; growth.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs)&#8208;incorporated solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (iono&#8208;SPEs) have high ionic conductivities but show non&#8208;uniform Li+ transport in different phases. This work greatly promotes Li+ transport in polymer phases by employing a poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE), PTC] as the framework of ILs to prepare iono&#8208;SPEs. Unlike PVDF, PTC with suitable polarity shows weaker adsorption energy on IL cations, reducing their possibility of occupying Li+&#8208;hopping sites. The significantly higher dielectric constant of PTC than PVDF facilitates the dissociation of Li&#8208;anions clusters. These two factors motivate Li+ transport along PTC chains, narrowing the difference in Li+ transport among varied phases. The LiFePO4/PTC iono&#8208;SPE/Li cells cycle steadily with capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work paves a new way to induce uniform Li+ flux in iono&#8208;SPEs through polarity and dielectric design of polymer matrix.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the periodic surface of catalysts by the inclusion of single atoms can help building atomic electric fields that highly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. We show here that this is achieved by modulating the interfacial water orientation and by subsequently decreasing the active sites&#8208;hydrogen distance.







Abstract
The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00&#215;1010&#8197;N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8722;H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early&#8208;Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preeclampsia is a cardiovascular complication that can occur during the second half of pregnancy. Here, we developed a point&#8208;of&#8208;care test incorporating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based lateral flow strips conjugated to novel vascular biomarkers including FKBPL and CD44 proteins, for timely and reliable diagnosis of preeclampsia during pregnancy that can improve the odds of preventing major maternal complications and possibly death.







Abstract
Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip&#8208;based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early&#8208;onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for FKBPL and 15&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut&#8208;off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100&#8201;% and the negative predictive value of 91&#8201;%. Our LFA shows promise as a rapid and highly sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care test for preeclampsia.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Trisubstituted Carbocyclic Olefins: An Access to Chiral Cyclic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral cyclic amides has been achieved via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the corresponding enamides with a high degree of enantioselectivity. This methodology extends the utilization of earth abundant metal catalysis in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic enamides has been achieved using an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. Using CoCl2/(S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE, several trisubstituted carbocyclic enamides were reduced with high activity and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to the corresponding saturated amides. The methodology can be extended to the synthesis of chiral amines by base hydrolysis of the hydrogenation products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal the presence of a high spin cobalt (II) species in the catalytic cycle. We propose that the hydrogenation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond proceeds via a sigma&#8208;bond&#8208;metathesis pathway.

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Fluorescent NETosis Reporter for the Prognosis Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) is developed for sensitive and specific NETosis detection. TNR1 activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, which are neutrophil granular proteases involved in NETs formation. TNR1 represents the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice.







Abstract
NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro&#8208;tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer immunotherapy. Non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains challenging. Herein, we report a Tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for the specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker&#8208;specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem&#8208;locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single&#8208;locked reporters fail to do so. The near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intratumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem&#8208;locked probe design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro-tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer immunotherapy. Non-invasive real-time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains challenging. Herein, we report a &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;andem-locked &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;ETosis &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;eporter&#8197;1 (TNR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) that activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for the specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker-specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem-locked design allows TNR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single-locked reporters fail to do so. The near-infrared signals from activated TNR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intratumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near-infrared signals from activated TNR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem-locked probe design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Utilizing Cationic Vacancies and Spontaneous Polarization on Cathode to Enhance Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage and Inhibit Dendrite Growth in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic vacancies of nickel cobalt oxide (NCOV) and a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) at the heterojunction cathode are introduced to boost zinc&#8208;ion adsorption and transport in Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The growth of zinc dendrites is inhibited by a mitigating electrolyte concentration gradient resulting from the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization field (SPF). Consequently, the NCOV/BFO heterojunction//Zn cell exhibits a comparable specific capacity and delivers a competitive capacity retention of 83.3&#8201;% over 3000 cycles.







Abstract
High energy density and intrinsic safety are the central pursuits in developing rechargeable Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). The capacity and stability of nickel cobalt oxide (NCO) cathode are unsatisfactory because of its semiconductor character. Herein, we propose a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) approach by synergizing cationic vacancies and ferroelectric spontaneous polarization on cathode side to facilitate electron adsorption and suppress zinc dendrite growth on the anode side. Concretely, NCO with cationic vacancies was constructed to expand lattice spacing for enhanced zinc&#8208;ion storage. Heterojunction with BEF leads to the Heterojunction//Zn cell exhibiting a capacity of 170.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and delivering a competitive capacity retention of 83.3&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We conclude the role of spontaneous polarization in suppressing zinc dendrite growth dynamics, which is conducive to developing high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;safety batteries via tailoring defective materials with ferroelectric polarization on the cathode.

         <title>Crystal Structure of an i&#8208;Motif from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a biologically relevant i&#8208;motif from the HRAS oncogene was solved to 1.8&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure is a dimer of two i&#8208;motifs formed by six C&#8722;C+ pairs. The structure contains 20 base pairs, of which only two are canonical. The extensive network of capping and connecting interactions is unprecedented and suggests that auxiliary interactions are essential for i&#8208;motif stability in vivo.







Abstract
An i&#8208;motif is a non&#8208;canonical DNA structure implicated in gene regulation and linked to cancers. The C&#8208;rich strand of the HRAS oncogene, 5&#8242;&#8208;CGCCCGTGCCCTGCGCCCGCAACCCGA&#8208;3&#8242; (herein referred to as iHRAS), forms an i&#8208;motif in vitro but its exact structure was unknown. HRAS is a member of the RAS proto&#8208;oncogene family. About 19&#8201;% of US cancer patients carry mutations in RAS genes. We solved the structure of iHRAS at 1.77&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure reveals that iHRAS folds into a double hairpin. The two double hairpins associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming an i&#8208;motif dimer capped by two loops on each end and linked by a connecting region. Six C&#8722;C+ base pairs form each i&#8208;motif core, and the core regions are extended by a G&#8722;G base pair and a cytosine stacking. Extensive canonical and non&#8208;canonical base pairing and stacking stabilizes the connecting region and loops. The iHRAS structure is the first atomic resolution structure of an i&#8208;motif from a human oncogene. This structure sheds light on i&#8208;motifs folding and function in the cell.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic catalyst in single&#8208;domain exhibits similar water oxidation performance in the absence of an external magnetic field as does a multi&#8208;domain counterpart under magnetization. The findings tell that an external magnetic field is not the only way to take the benefits of spin&#8208;polarized water oxidation. Reducing the particle size into the single&#8208;domain region can also achieve the same.







Abstract
The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for OER. Herein, we demonstrate that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.

         <title>Rational Design of the &#946;&#8208;Bulge Gate in a Green Fluorescent Protein Accelerates the Kinetics of Sulfate Sensing
</title>

         <dc:description>
The serendipitous discovery of an intrinsic fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor for sulfate called SulfOFF&#8208;1 is reported. This function was unlocked by introducing mutations in a solvent&#8208;exposed region of the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. An integrated approach encompassing in vitro spectroscopy and in silico modeling provides a comprehensive understanding of the sensor mechanism.







Abstract
Detection of anions in complex aqueous media is a fundamental challenge with practical utility that can be addressed by supramolecular chemistry. Biomolecular hosts such as proteins can be used and adapted as an alternative to synthetic hosts. Here, we report how the mutagenesis of the &#946;&#8208;bulge residues (D137 and W138) in mNeonGreen, a bright, monomeric fluorescent protein, unlocks and tunes the anion preference at physiological pH for sulfate, resulting in the turn&#8208;off sensor SulfOFF&#8208;1. This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the &#946;&#8208;barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.

         <title>Construction of Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers via Asymmetric Metal Carbene gem&#8208;Dialkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines is reported, which leads to poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones with excellent enantioselectivity. This unprecedented metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation reaction features a cascade formal asymmetric allylation and aminomethylation process with concomitant construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using readily available materials.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8722;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi&#8208;component reactions that build two C&#8722;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene gem&#8208;difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aminocyclobutane Monoesters: Synthesis and Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocyclobutanes are high potential building blocks but have been underexplored. A one&#8208;step synthesis to access them from commercial starting materials was developed. Using these new donor&#8208;acceptor systems, a (4+2) annulation was conducted with indoles using silylium catalysis. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction.







Abstract
A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminocyclobutane monoesters starting from commercially available reagents is reported. The obtained strained rings undergo (4+2) dearomative annulation with indole partners using silylium catalysis. This organocatalyzed annulation provided tricyclic indolines with four new stereocenters in up to quantitative yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 diastereoselectivity and can proceed both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction. This divergent outcome could be rationalized based on DFT calculations.

         <title>A Dicyanomethyl Radical Conjugated with a Pyridylamino Group: Combining Radical&#8208;based Dynamic Covalent Chemistry and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group that combines dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) property based on a reversible radical coupling/cleavage reaction and coordination ability to metal ions for the first time. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.







Abstract
In this work, we aimed to develop a dicyanomethyl radical that undergoes both reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation and metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions to combine dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) based on organic radicals with coordination chemistry. We have previously reported a dicyanomethyl radical conjugated with a triphenylamine (1&#8901;) that exhibits a monomer/dimer equilibrium between the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (12). We designed and synthesized a novel dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group as a coordination point (2&#8901;) by replacing the phenyl group of 1&#8901; with a 3&#8208;pyridyl group. We showed that 2&#8901; is also in an equilibrium with the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (22) in solution and has suitable thermodynamic parameters for application in DCC. 22 coordinates to PdCl2 in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio to selectively form a metallamacrocycle (22)2(PdCl2)2, and its structure was clarified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR, ESR, and electronic absorption measurements revealed that (22)2(PdCl2)2 also undergoes the reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation reaction. Ligand&#8208;exchange experiment showed that 22 was liberated from (22)2(PdCl2)2 by the addition of another ligand with a higher affinity for PdII. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.

         <title>Sodium Carbazolide and Derivatives as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium carbazolide tetrahydrofuran derivatives, a new type of metalorganic&#8208;based materials intended for hydrogen storage, are fabricated and exhibit fast ionic conductivity as high as 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with excellent interfacial stability against Na electrodes. A &#8220;neutral ligand&#8208;assisted&#8221; cation migration mechanism is proposed, providing a new strategy for the design of superionic conductors.







Abstract
Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na&#8208;CZ) and its THF&#8208;coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na+ conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF&#8208;coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na+ conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C for Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;1THF and Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na+ conductors under the same condition. Furthermore, stable Na plating/stripping is observed even over 400&#8197;h cycling, showing outstanding interfacial stability and compatibility against Na electrode. More advantages such as ease of synthesis, low&#8208;cost, and cold pressing for molding can be obtained. In situ NMR results revealed that the evaporation of THF may play an essential role in the Na+ migration, where the movement of THF creates defects/vacancies and facilitates the migration of Na+.

         <title>Organohydrogels with High&#8208;Speed Lubrication by Confining Polymer Chain Mobility by an Interpenetrated Heteronetwork</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement effect of an oleophilic network limits the mobility of hydrophilic polymer chains on the countersurfaces. This reduces the energy dissipation on stretching polymer chains during shearing, thus decreasing the frictional stress in the high velocity region.







Abstract
Hydrogels with pure hydrophilic network have received much attention due to their excellent low frictional behavior. However, the lubrication performance of hydrogels is not satisfied under high&#8208;speed condition due to the energy dissipation caused by adsorbed polymer chains as well as the failure of lubricating mechanisms accompanied by the transition of lubrication regime. In this work, interpenetrating double&#8208;network organohydrogels were constructed by combining hydrophilic and oleophilic polymer networks to modify the physiochemical properties of surface polymer chains, especially the chain mobility. The oleophilic polymer network spatially restricting the mobility of the swollen hydrophilic network in water, resulted in a low coefficient of friction (ca. 0.01) compared with conventional hydrogels at high speed (0.1&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1). Meanwhile, the organohydrogels had superior wear resistance, with almost no wear observed on the sliding track after 5&#8197;k&#8197;cycles of rubbing at high speed. The design concept of organohydrogels can be extended to a variety of low&#8208;wear, highly&#8208;lubricating materials.

         <title>Constructing Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Heterogeneous Nanowire Arrays for Efficient Overall Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By proposing and fabricating Ni2P&#8208;CoCH heterostructure with large &#916;&#934; as a model catalyst for overall alkaline water electrolysis, the introduction of a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is successfully realized to create the asymmetrical charge distributions on catalyst surfaces. The negative charge&#8208;enriched Ni2P and positive charge&#8208;enriched CoCH as active sites separately achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities.







Abstract
Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate heterogeneous nickel phosphide&#8208;cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Impressively, Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to obtain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the assembled lab&#8208;scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50&#8197;h electrocatalysis with a 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface&#8208;induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions. This work offers an avenue to rationally design high&#8208;performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts.

         <title>A General Preparation of Solid Solution&#8208;Oxide Heterojunction Photocatalysts through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Transformation Induced Pre&#8208;nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop a generally applicable strategy to prepare the solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunction through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) transformation induced pre&#8208;nucleation. Our approach involved the transformation of MOFs possessing distinct topologies, leading to the pre&#8208;nucleation of the parent MOF in the form of an oxide within the pores of the daughter MOF. This transformative process was a pivotal step in synthesizing novel heterojunctions comprising solid solutions with significant variations of metal ions (Ce1&#8722;xTixO2) and rare earth oxide (CeO2).







Abstract
Solid solution&#8208;oxide heterostructures combine the advantages of solid solution and heterojunction materials to improve electronic structure and optical properties by metal doping, and enhance charge separation and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts by creating a built&#8208;in electric field. Nevertheless, the effective design and synthesis of these materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we develop a generally applicable strategy that leverages the transformable properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunctions with controllable structural and chemical compositions. The process consists of three main steps. First, MOFs with different topological structures and metal centers are transformed, accompanied by pre&#8208;nucleation of a metal oxide. Second, solid solution is prepared through calcination of the transformed MOFs. Finally, a heterojunction is formed by combining solid solution with another metal oxide group through endogenous overflow. DFT calculations and study on carrier dynamics show that the structure of the material effectively prevents electrons from returning to the bulk phase, exhibiting superior photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2. This study is expected to promote the controllable synthesis and research of MOF&#8208;derived heterojunctions.

         <title>Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8208;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 for Reversible Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional MOF, (Cu3(HHTP)2), is synthesized with two different morphologies. Flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like shaped particles were evaluated to investigate the impact of the particle morphology of MOFs on electrochemical Li+ ion storage. By optimization of the particle morphology, diffusion limitation of the Faradaic process can be strongly reduced.







Abstract
Faradaic reactions including charge transfer are often accompanied with diffusion limitation inside the bulk. Conductive two&#8208;dimensional frameworks (2D MOFs) with a fast ion transport can combine both&#8212;charge transfer and fast diffusion inside their porous structure. To study remaining diffusion limitations caused by particle morphology, different synthesis routes of Cu&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu3(HHTP)2), a copper&#8208;based 2D MOF, are used to obtain flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like MOF particles. Both morphologies are systematically characterized and evaluated for redox&#8208;active Li+ ion storage. The redox mechanism is investigated by means of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ XRD. Both types are compared regarding kinetic properties for Li+ ion storage via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A significant influence of particle morphology for 2D MOFs on kinetic aspects of electrochemical Li+ ion storage can be observed. This study opens the path for optimization of redox active porous structures to overcome diffusion limitations of Faradaic processes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Anion&#8208;Binding Catalytic Living Cationic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution reports in&#8208;depth mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization in which the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalyst and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions in the whole catalytic cycle are elucidated through a combination of theoretical DFT study and experimental study.







Abstract
Exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner.

&lt;p&gt;This contribution reports in-depth mechanistic insight into anion-binding catalytic living cationic polymerization in which the structure-reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno-cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalyst and the roles of anion-binding interactions in the whole catalytic cycle are elucidated through a combination of theoretical DFT study and experimental study.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploiting non-covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non-covalent anion-binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner. Here, we further elucidate the structure-reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno-cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalysts and the roles of anion-binding interactions by a combined theoretical DFT study and experimental study. The investigation suggests that the distinct &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodiphosph(V)azane framework combined with &#8220;selenium effect&#8221; and electron-withdrawing 3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Phenyl substitution pattern in catalyst enables a critical contribution to accessing excellent stability, anion affinity and solubility under polymerization conditions. Thus, the catalyst could leverage anion-binding interactions to precisely control reversible and transient dormant-active species equilibrium, allowing it to dynamically bind, recognize and pre-organize propagating ionic species and monomer, thereby facilitating efficient chain propagation and minimizing irreversible chain transfer events under mild conditions. The more in-depth understanding of the mechanism for anion-binding catalytic LCP reported herein should help to guide future catalyst design and to extend this concept to broader polymerization systems where ionic species serve as crucial intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheet catalyst was developed for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction. Benefiting from the tandem catalysis of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets, a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. RHE as well as high stability of 700&#8197;h in a flow cell were achieved.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8208;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700&#8197;h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;88&#8201;% at 365&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Alcohols and Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Alcohols under Manganese Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

A manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols in a divergent synthesis of either &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols or &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is herein reported. A wide range of different alcohols could undergo the cross&#8208;coupling process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products by using the same catalyst, with overall moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols for the divergent synthesis of &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols and &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is reported. Employing the well&#8208;defined Mn&#8208;MACHOPh as the catalyst, this novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable disubstituted alcohols and ketones in moderate to good yields. The strong influence of the reaction temperature on the selective formation of alcohol products was theorized in preliminary DFT studies. Studies have shown that the Gibbs free energy of the formation of alcohols is thermodynamically more favourable than corresponding ketones at a lower temperature.

         <dc:description>
The study reports selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and N&#8208;oxides, where electrochemical outcomes were dictated by the cathode material (RVC=reticulated vitreous carbon). The adaptability of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides for various C&#8722;H functionalization reactions was showcased. Furthermore, 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were utilized to synthesize the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3), key intermediates for various drugs, and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
The selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and their N&#8208;oxides and the subsequent C&#8722;H functionalization of the 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides are described. The electrochemical outcomes were determined by the nature of the cathode material. When a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode was used, a wide range of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized, and the electrosynthesis products were deoxygenated to N&#8208;heteroaromatics, owing to cathodic cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond via paired electrolysis, when a Zn cathode was used. The scope of this electrochemical protocol is broad, as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substrates were tolerated. The potency of this electrochemical strategy was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, making this reaction attractive for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazole derivatives for pharmaceutical research and development. Detailed mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggested a radical pathway featuring iminoxyl radicals. Owing to the rich reactivity of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides, diverse C&#8722;H functionalization reactions were performed. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides by synthesizing the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3); key intermediates for bendazac, benzydamine, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAM&#8208;531, and gamendazole analogues; and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Overcoming the Ambient Manufacturability&#8208;Performance Bottleneck in Perovskite Nanocrystal Emitters for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crude large&#8208;scale synthesis strategy is proposed to overcome the ambient manufacturability&#8208;performance bottleneck to achieve high&#8208;quality perovskite nanocrystals with strong emission and narrow bandwidth, regardless of humidity or temperature. The resulting nanocrystals capped with PbSP&#8208;dominated shell have low trap and ligand density, facilitating charge&#8208;carrier hopping and tunneling.







Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have risen rapidly in luminescence efficiency and color purity. However, their high performance requires careful and complex pre&#8208;treatment of precursors and precise regulation of the reaction atmosphere; otherwise, their emission will be weak and broad. To overcome these limitations, we develop a facile ligand exchange method using a new type of bidentate ligand, which is obtained by reacting cheap sulfur with tributylphosphine (S&#8208;TBP).

&lt;p&gt;A crude large-scale synthesis strategy is proposed to overcome the ambient manufacturability-performance bottleneck to achieve high-quality perovskite nanocrystals with strong emission and narrow bandwidth, regardless of humidity or temperature. The resulting nanocrystals capped with PbSP-dominated shell have low trap and ligand density, facilitating charge-carrier hopping and tunneling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have risen rapidly in luminescence efficiency and color purity. However, their high performance requires careful and complex pre-treatment of precursors and precise regulation of the reaction atmosphere; otherwise, their emission will be weak and broad. To overcome these limitations, we develop a facile ligand exchange method using a new type of bidentate ligand, which is obtained by reacting cheap sulfur with tributylphosphine (S-TBP). During ligand exchange, the double bond between P and S atoms breaks and a single bond is formed between them, after which S-TBP switches into a bidentate ligand and binds to a perovskite NC at two points. With short-chain S-TBP ligands that have high spatial position resistance, both NC spacing and surface ligand density can be reduced, thereby improving carrier injection and transport. On the NC surface after ligand exchange, halogen vacancies were substantially filled, leading to a PbSP (Pb, S, and P elements) component-dominated shell that greatly decreases trap density and enhances material stability. The resulting perovskite NCs are stable and bright with a photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;96&#8201;%, and an external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;%. Note that our ligand-exchange strategy remains effective even when scaling up, which should accelerate commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molten Salts&#8208;Driven Discovery of a Polar Mixed&#8208;Anion 3D Framework at the Nanoscale: Zn4Si2O7Cl2, Charge Transport and Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>

Nanowires of the new oxychloride Zn4Si2O7Cl2 crystallize from molten salts as a polar three&#8208;dimensional tetrahedral framework. They exhibit strongly anisotropic charge carrier mobility, adjustable electrical properties, and photoelectrochemical properties for H2 production from water.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion compounds widen the chemical space of attainable materials compared to single anionic compounds, but the exploration of their structural diversity is limited by common synthetic paths. Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon&#8208;based connectors from a non&#8208;oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed&#8208;anion solids

         <dc:description>
An efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been developed, especially its convergent pattern for E/Z&#8208;substrates. Excellent enantioselectivity, wide substrate scope, and valuable applications were shown.







Abstract
Using the diphosphine&#8208;cobalt&#8208;zinc catalytic system, an efficient asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been realized. In particular, the Ph&#8208;BPE ligand can achieve convergent asymmetric hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;substrates. High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were obtained for both acyclic and cyclic enamides bearing &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl substituents. Hydrogenated products can be applied for the synthesis of useful chiral drugs such as Arfromoterol, Rotigotine, and Norsertraline. In addition, reasonable catalytic mechanism and stereocontrol mode are proposed based on DFT calculations.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>

A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXenzyme shows benign biocompatibility and multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, combatting neurogenic hypertension by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting inflammatory response.







Abstract
Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but there is still a tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicines. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme displays multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in a stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozymes to treat hypertension but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.

         <title>Giant Molecule Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Processed Using Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) EV&#8208;i and EV&#8208;o were synthesized and applied in non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed organic solar cells (OSCs). The EV&#8208;i based OSC exhibits suitable phase separation in active layer, which contributes to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27&#8201;%, while the EV&#8208;o based OSCs show a poor PCE of 2.50&#8201;% due to its excessive aggregation.







Abstract
High efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) based on A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were mostly fabricated by toxic halogenated solvent processing, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the non&#8208;halogenated solvent processed OSCs is mainly restricted by the excessive aggregation of the SMAs. To address this issue, we developed two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) with the &#960;&#8208;spacer linking on the inner carbon (EV&#8208;i) or out carbon (EV&#8208;o) of benzene end group of the SMA with longer alkyl side chains (ECOD) for the capability of non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processing. Interestingly, EV&#8208;i possesses a twisted molecular structure but enhanced conjugation, while EV&#8208;o shows a better planar molecular structure but weakened conjugation. The OSC with EV&#8208;i as acceptor processed by the non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) demonstrated a higher PCE of 18.27&#8201;% than that of the devices based on the acceptor of ECOD (16.40&#8201;%) or EV&#8208;o (2.50&#8201;%). 18.27&#8201;% is one of the highest PCEs among the OSCs fabricated from non&#8208;halogenated solvents so far, benefitted from the suitable twisted structure, stronger absorbance and high charge carrier mobility of EV&#8208;i. The results indicate that the GMAs with suitable linking site would be the excellent candidates for fabricating high performance OSCs processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of a Highly Stable Aluminium Phosphonate Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Showing Reversible HCl Adsorption</title>

Protons make the difference. Highly acidic synthesis conditions were employed to synthesize porous MIII&#8208;phosphonates with different degrees of framework protonation. Rapid release of HCl in solution and re&#8208;adsorption from aqueous solution and from the gas phase is demonstrated and structural changes that accompany these processes are elucidated.







Abstract
A concept for obtaining isoreticular compounds with tri&#8208; instead of tetravalent metal cations using highly acidic reaction conditions was developed and successfully applied in a high throughput study using N,N&#8242;&#8208;piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic&#160;acid) (H4PMP), that resulted in the discovery of a new porous aluminium phosphonate denoted CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl. The high&#8208;throughput study was subsequently extended to other trivalent metal ions. Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl demonstrates reversible desorption of HCl (18.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading) with three distinct compositions observed with zero, four or six HCl molecules per formula unit. Structural changes were followed in detail by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, EDX analysis as well as IR spectroscopy. Rapid desorption of HCl in water within minutes and subsequent adsorption from the gas phase and from aqueous solution are shown. Furthermore, it is possible to adsorb HBr into the guest free Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60 framework, demonstrating the high stability of this compound.

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an important transformation in organic synthesis. Herein, we present a unified electrochemical strategy for the efficient and selective synthesis of disilanes, oligosilanes, and cyclosilanes&#8212;which are important precursors for the synthesis of functional organic and polymeric compounds&#8212;from readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism.

         <title>Ultrarapid Nanomanufacturing of High&#8208;Quality Bimetallic Anode Library toward Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy fabrication through tube furnace annealing (TFA) faces many limitations, such as uncontrolled coarsening and volatilization of constituent metals. In this work, we apply an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method to realize the general fabrication of a family of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys. The rapid HTR approach could create a new and wide space for broad applications of nano&#8208;sized unique alloys.







Abstract
Bimetallic alloy nanomaterials are promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high electrochemical performance. The most well&#8208;adopted fabrication method for bimetallic alloy nanomaterials is tube furnace annealing (TFA) synthesis, which can hardly satisfy the trade&#8208;off among granularity, dispersity and grain coarsening due to mutual constraints. Herein, we report a facile, scalable and ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method for the fabrication of a library of ultrafine bimetallic alloys with narrow size distribution (&#8776;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm), uniform dispersion and high loading. The metal&#8208;anchor containing heteroatoms (i.e., O and N), ultrarapid heating/cooling rate (&#8776;103&#8197;K&#8201;s&#8722;1) and super&#8208;short heating duration (several seconds) synergistically contribute to the successful synthesis of small&#8208;sized alloy anodes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;prepared BiSb&#8208;HTR anode shows ultrahigh stability indicated by negligible degradation after 800&#8197;cycles. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the K+ storage mechanism of BiSb&#8208;HTR. This study can shed light on the new, rapid and scalable nanomanufacturing of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys toward extended applications of energy storage, energy conversion and electrocatalysis.

         <title>Defect Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Mott&#8211;Schottky Photocatalysts for Enhanced Ammonia Synthesis at Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8722;x was synthesized with visible light absorption and extremely low work function. High&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic ammonia synthesis was achieved at low pressure with excellent catalytic activities. The pyrochlore structure exhibits amazing intrinsic activity, markedly enhances N2 dissociation on Ru, and is expected to be an ideal material for efficient ambient ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The ambient ammonia synthesis coupled with distributed green hydrogen production technology can provide promising solutions for low&#8208;carbon NH3 production and H2 storage. Herein, we reported Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8722;x with remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and a very low work function, enabling effective visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 at low pressure down to 0.2&#8197;atm. The photocatalytic rate was 2.8&#8197;times higher than that of the best previously reported photocatalyst and the photo&#8208;thermal rate at 425&#8197;K was similar to that of Ru&#8208;loaded black TiO2 at 633&#8197;K. Compared to perovskite&#8208;type KTaO3&#8722;x with the same composition, the pyrochlore exhibited a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity due to a higher photoexcited charge separation efficiency and a higher conduction band position. The interfacial Schottky barrier and spontaneous electron transfer between K2Ta2O6&#8722;x and Ru further improve photoexcited charge separation and accumulate energetic electrons to facilitate N2 activation.

         <title>Photodissociative Modules that Control Dual&#8208;Emission Properties in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Organoborane Fluorophores</title>

         <dc:description>
The diversity of triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores has been increased by extensive tuning of the triarylborane moiety. Herein, ortho&#8208; P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X=O or S) are introduced onto a boron atom as a photodissociative module to impart the fluorophores with responsiveness to multiple stimuli or environmental parameters. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores that consist of an electron&#8208;donating amino group and an electron&#8208;accepting triarylborane moiety generally exhibit substantial solvatochromism in their fluorescence while retaining high fluorescence quantum yields even in polar media. Herein, we report a new family of this compound class, which bears ortho&#8208;P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X=O or S) as a photodissociative module. The P=X moiety that intramolecularly coordinates to the boron atom undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to dual emission from the corresponding tetra&#8208; and tricoordinate boron species. The susceptibility of the systems to photodissociation depends on the coordination ability of the P=O and P=S moieties, whereby the latter facilitates dissociation. The intensity ratios of the dual emission bands are sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solution polarity, and the viscosity of the medium. Moreover, precise tuning of the P(=X)R2 group and the electron&#8208;donating amino moiety led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrophosphinylation of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of methylene cyclopropanes allowed for the synthesis of a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to 94&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to support the experimental results and to investigate the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) has presented a considerable challenge due to the difficult manipulation of regioselectivity and complicated reaction patterns. Herein, we report a straightforward Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrophosphinylation reaction of MCPs via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage. This method allows for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Supramolecular Peptide Nanostructures Regulate Catalytic Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based supramolecular nanostructures can mimic the activity and 3&#8208;dimensional complexity of enzymes. We report three tetrapeptides with the same amino acids but in different orders that self&#8208;assemble into unique nanostructures, and we find that their supramolecular morphology influences enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations reveal how histidine residues clustered in hydrophobic pockets influence their catalytic activity.







Abstract
We report three constitutionally isomeric tetrapeptides, each comprising one glutamic acid (E) residue, one histidine (H) residue, and two lysine (KS) residues functionalized with side&#8208;chain hydrophobic S&#8208;aroylthiooxime (SATO) groups. Depending on the order of amino acids, these amphiphilic peptides self&#8208;assembled in aqueous solution into different nanostructures:nanoribbons, a mixture of nanotoroids and nanoribbons, or nanocoils. Each nanostructure catalyzed hydrolysis of a model substrate, with the nanocoils exhibiting the greatest rate enhancement and the highest enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations, analyzed with unsupervised machine learning, revealed clusters of H residues in hydrophobic pockets along the outer edge of the nanocoils, providing insight for the observed catalytic rate enhancement. Finally, all three supramolecular nanostructures catalyzed hydrolysis of the l&#8208;substrate only when a pair of enantiomeric Boc&#8208;l/d&#8208;Phe&#8208;ONp substrates were tested. This study highlights how subtle molecular&#8208;level changes can influence supramolecular nanostructures, and ultimately affect catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Dual Recycling of Depolymerization Catalyst and Biodegradable Polyester that Markedly Outperforms Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual recycling of the potent depolymerization catalyst PMA and biodegradable polyester PVL that largely outperforms commodity polyolefins has been achieved. The chemical recycling of PVL in bulk phase is performed under mild temperature of only 100&#8201;&#176;C, recovering the pure monomer in quantitative yield for closed&#8208;loop recycling and the depolymerization catalyst that can be reused repeatedly without loss of activity and efficiency.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable, circular polymers continue to attract increasing attention, but rendering both catalysts for depolymerization and high&#8208;performance polymers recyclable is a more sustainable yet challenging goal. Here we introduce a dual catalyst/polymer recycling system in that recyclable inorganic phosphomolybdic acid catalyzes selective depolymerization of high&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature biodegradable poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) in bulk phase, which, upon reaching suitable molecular weight, exhibits outstanding mechanical performance with a high tensile strength of &#8776;66.6&#8197;MPa, fracture strain of &#8776;904&#8201;%, and toughness of &#8776;308&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3, and thus markedly outperforms commodity polyolefins, recovering its monomer in pure state and quantitative yield at only 100&#8201;&#176;C. In sharp contrast, the uncatalyzed depolymerization not only requires a high temperature of &gt;310&#8201;&#176;C but is also low yielding and non&#8208;selective. Importantly, the recovered monomer can be repolymerized as is to reproduce the same polymer, thereby closing the circular loop, and the recycled catalyst can be reused repeatedly for depolymerization runs without loss of its catalytic activity and efficiency.

         <title>Electrically Conductive &#960;&#8208;Intercalated Graphitic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Alternate &#960;&#8208;Donor/Acceptor Stacks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy afforded the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated 2D graphitic metal&#8211;organic framework (iGMOF) containing alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor stacks of metal&#8208;coordinated &#960;&#8208;donor ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated planar &#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules, which displayed an impressive bulk electrical conductivity (&#8776;30&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1) thanks to its simultaneous in&#8208;plane through&#8208;bond and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane through &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor stacks charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional graphitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through&#8208;bond in&#8208;plane charge transport, however, less efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conduction across the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom&#8208;up method the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built&#8208;in alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor (&#960;&#8208;D/A) stacks of CuII&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated &#960;&#8208;acidic hexacyano&#8208;triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport while the hexagonal Cu3(HATP)2 scaffold maintained in&#8208;plane conduction. As a result, iGMOF1 attained an order of magnitude higher bulk electrical conductivity and much smaller activation energy than Cu3(HATP)2 (&#963;=25 vs. 2&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1, Ea=36 vs. 65&#8197;meV), demostrating that simultaneous in&#8208;plane (through&#8208;bond) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (through &#960;D/A stacks) charge transport can generate higher electrical conductivity in novel iGMOFs.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional graphitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through-bond in-plane charge transport, however, less efficient out-of-plane conduction across the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom-up method the first &#960;-intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built-in alternate &#960;-donor/acceptor (&#960;-D/A) stacks of Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated electron-rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non-coordinatively intercalated &#960;-acidic hexacyano-triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out-of-plane charge transport while the hexagonal Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HATP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scaffold maintained in-plane conduction. As a result, iGMOF1 attained an order of magnitude higher bulk electrical conductivity and much smaller activation energy than Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HATP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#963;=25 vs. 2&#8197;S&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=36 vs. 65&#8197;meV), demostrating that simultaneous in-plane (through-bond) and out-of-plane (through &#960;D/A stacks) charge transport can generate higher electrical conductivity in novel iGMOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>I3&#8722;/I&#8722; Redox Reaction&#8208;mediated Organic Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries with Accelerated Kinetics and Long Shelf Lives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox mediators (RMs) have been introduced in organic Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to solve the sluggish kinetics and short shelf lives issues that have been plaguing ZABs long&#8208;lastingly. Based on the chemical oxidation of I3&#8722; and catalytic effect of I&#8722;, our ZABs show accelerated kinetics and long shelf lives in open air.







Abstract
The storage time of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) for practical implementation have been neglected long&#8208;lastingly. ZABs based on organic solvents promise long shelf lives but suffer from sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a longly storable ZAB with accelerated kinetics mediated by I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox. In the charge process, the electrooxidation of Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O is accelerated by I3&#8722; chemical oxidation. In the discharge process, I&#8722; adsorbed on the electrocatalyst changes the energy level of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefitting from these advantages, the prepared ZAB shows remarkably improved round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.03&#8201;% vs. 30.97&#8201;% without the mediator), and long&#8208;term cycling time (&gt;2600&#8197;h) in ambient air without replacing any components or applying any protective treatment to Zn anode and electrocatalyst. After resting for 30&#8197;days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5&#8197;h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200&#8197;h (440&#8197;cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25&#8197;h, and 50/25&#8197;h (10/5&#8197;cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Essential Amino Acids from Nitric Oxide Using Atomically Dispersed Fe on N&#8208;doped Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creative strategy is established to convert NOx from exhaust gas and nitrate&#8208;laden wastewater into amino acids by electrochemistry with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon. It is significantly important for NOx removal and efficient activated hydrogen utilization from water splitting directly to synthesize high&#8208;value nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds.







Abstract
How to transfer industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;values product is significantly important and challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative method for artificial synthesis of essential &#945;&#8208;amino acids from nitric oxide (NO) by reacting with &#945;&#8208;keto acids through electrocatalytic process with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (AD&#8208;Fe/NC) as the catalyst. A yield of valine with 32.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 is delivered at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding a selectivity of 11.3&#8201;%. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopy analyses show that NO as nitrogen source converted to hydroxylamine that promptly nucleophilic attacked on the electrophilic carbon center of &#945;&#8208;keto acid to form oxime and subsequent reductive hydrogenation occurred on the way to amino acid. Over 6 kinds of &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been successfully synthesized and gaseous nitrogen source can be also replaced by liquid nitrogen source (NO3&#8722;). Our findings not only provide a creative method for converting nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;valued products, which is of epoch&#8208;making significance towards artificial synthesis of amino acids, but also benefit in deploying near&#8208;zero&#8208;emission technologies for global environmental and economic development.

         <title>Direct Arylation of Silicon Nanocrystals with Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Derived Benzynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;free arylation reagents are reported for the functionalization of silicon nanocrystals. Benzyne derivatives formed via a hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction effectively cleave Si&#8722;H bonds and yield benzenoid&#8208;passivated silicon surfaces under mild conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have garnered significant interest in optoelectronics and biomedical applications. Direct arylation provides pathways to enhance the solution processability of particles and manipulate the photophysical and electronic properties of SiNCs. Unfortunately, existing methods employed to prepare aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs are based on organometallic coupling or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies, which require metal&#8208;based reagents for preactivation or the precursors and complicated post&#8208;treatment processes for product purification. Herein, we demonstrate a metal&#8208;free method that directly functionalizes SiNCs with aryl&#8208;based ligands. We design a series of benzyne derivatives formed from the thermal cyclization of predesigned alkynes, allowing efficient arylation on hydride&#8208;terminated silicon surfaces under mild conditions. These aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs exhibit strong blue emissions with nanosecond&#8208;scaled decay, suggesting the formation of a new radiative recombination channel on SiNC surfaces.

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols typically requires very harsh conditions and has therefore not been used for the self&#8208;assembly of host&#8208;guest systems. In this work, unexpected solvent and salt effects are described, rationalized and exploited for the synthesis of degradable supramolecular hosts.







Abstract
The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive experimental and computational account on the reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in drug delivery.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Lactam Electrophiles for Covalent Chemical Biology
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

We report here an &#945;&#8208;lactam electrophile that is tolerant of aqueous buffers and reacts with biologically relevant nucleophiles. Additionally, the compound efficiently targets and inhibits the serine hydrolase enzymes CES1/2 in HepG2 cells and cell lysate. The unique reactivity of &#945;&#8208;lactams suggests many potential applications of this new warhead&#8208;class within covalent chemical biology.







Abstract
Electrophilic groups are one of the key pillars of contemporary chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For instance, 3&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds&#8212;such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines&#8212;possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The &#945;&#8208;lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an &#945;&#8208;lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases&#8197;1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo&#8208; and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, this study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of &#945;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.

         <dc:description>
A method for the C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) of bromo(iodo)arenes with 3&#176;, 2&#176;, and 1&#176;alkyl bromides is reported. This mild XEC displays a broad scope with demonstrated functional group tolerance and finds use in the streamlined preparation of synthetically challenging bioactive compounds. Given the prevalence of its building blocks and the substrate generality, this discovery will likely inspire numerous applications.







Abstract
Despite several methodologies established for C(sp2)&#8722;I selective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, achieving arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons by cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl precursors with bromo(iodo)arenes in a C(sp2)&#8722;I selective manner is rare. Here we report a general Ni&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reaction, in which, beyond 3&#176; alkyl bromides (for constructing arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons), 2&#176; and 1&#176; alkyl bromides are also demonstrated to be viable coupling partners. Moreover, this mild XEC displays excellent C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and functional group compatibility. The practicality of this XEC is demonstrated in simplifying the routes to several medicinally relevant and synthetically challenging compounds. Extensive experiments show that the terpyridine&#8208;ligated NiI halide can exclusively activate alkyl bromides, forming a NiI&#8722;alkyl complex through a Zn reduction. Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8722;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.

         <title>Electron Acceptor Molecule Doping Induced &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction to Promote Charge Transport Kinetics for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene is utilized to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to facilitate carrier transportation. It effectively reduces defect density and optimizes energy level alignment. As a result, the 2D/3D perovskite solar cell achieves a champion PCE of up to 24.01&#8201;% coupled with greatly strengthened environmental stability.







Abstract
Although the incorporation of 2D perovskite into 3D perovskite can greatly enhance intrinsic stability, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D/3D perovskite is still inferior to its 3D counterpart due to poor carrier transport kinetics resulted from the quantum and dielectric confinement of 2D component. To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01&#8201;%. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94&#8201;% after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000&#8197;h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>

Shape&#8208;selective catalysis is enabled by a steric, kinetic&#8208;control strategy based on the substrate being anchored on the internal wall of an adjustable pore space in porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates via synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme's ability, we showcase herein a targeting strategy with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydrocyanation toward Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;Trisubstituted Acrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various trisubstituted E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitriles have been successfully synthesized from the same starting material via a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent hydrocyanation reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that Z&#8208;acrylonitriles were obtained by a sequential hydrocyanation/geometric isomerization (E to Z) pathway.







Abstract
We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of propiolamides for the stereodivergent synthesis of trisubstituted acrylonitriles. This synthetic method tolerated various primary, secondary and tertiary propiolamides. The cautious selection of a suitable ligand is essential to the success of this stereodivergent process. Control experiments indicate the intermediacy of E&#8208;acrylonitriles, which lead to Z&#8208;acrylonitriles via isomerization. The density functional theory calculations suggests that the bidentate ligand L2 enables a feasible cyclometallation/isomerization pathway for the E to Z isomerization, while the monodentate ligand L1 inhibits the isomerization, leading to divergent stereoselectivity. The usefulness of this method can be demonstrated by the readily derivatization of products to give various E&#8208; and Z&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. In addition, the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitrile products have also been successfully employed in cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO Mediated by Silver Single Atoms Anchored on Tubular Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag single atoms anchored on hollow porous polygonal tubular carbon nitride (Ag1@PCN) form a catalyst with strong metal&#8211;support interactions. Ag&#8722;N3 exhibits enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity and high CO selectivity due to favorable *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and the dynamic transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between PCN and the Ag single atoms.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into fuels and value&#8208;added chemical products. However, photocatalysts usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, we describe anchoring of Ag single atoms on hollow porous polygonal C3N4 nanotubes (PCN) to form the photocatalyst Ag1@PCN with Ag&#8722;N3 coordination for CO2 photoreduction using H2O as the reductant. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag1@PCN exhibits a high CO production rate of 0.32&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mass of catalyst: 2&#8197;mg), a high selectivity (&gt;94&#8201;%), and an excellent stability in the long term. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that the strong metal&#8211;support interactions (Ag&#8722;N3) favor *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and accelerate dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers between C3N4 and Ag single atoms, thereby accounting for the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity with a high CO selectivity. This work provides a deep insight into the important role of strong metal&#8211;support interactions in enhancing the photoactivity and CO selectivity of CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Selective Functionalisation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalisation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine is achieved by xanthone&#8208;catalysed photoredox catalysis. The specific nature of the functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine on ribonucleic acid (RNA) was used to install a Halo&#8208;Tag reactive handle which enabled the chemical enrichment of 5&#8208;methylcytosine containing RNA.







Abstract
The epigenetic modification 5&#8208;methylcytosine plays a vital role in development, cell specific gene expression and disease states. The selective chemical modification of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine methyl group is challenging. Currently, no such chemistry exists. Direct functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine would improve the detection and study of this epigenetic feature. We report a xanthone&#8208;photosensitised process that introduces a 4&#8208;pyridine modification at a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We propose a reaction mechanism for this type of reaction based on density functional calculations and apply transition state analysis to rationalise differences in observed reaction efficiencies between cyanopyridine derivatives. The reaction is initiated by single electron oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine followed by deprotonation to generate the methyl group radical. Cross coupling of the methyl radical with 4&#8208;cyanopyridine installs a 4&#8208;pyridine label at 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We demonstrate use of the pyridination reaction to enrich 5&#8208;methylcytosine&#8208;containing ribonucleic acid.

         <title>Dual Microenvironment Modulation of Pd Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PdCu2 nanoparticles are incorporated into isoreticular COFs, namely, MF&#8722;X (X=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3 and &#8722;CN), for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, where PdCu2@MF&#8722;CH3 exhibits the best catalytic performance. The dual modulation of the Pd microenvironment turns out to be crucial: the Cu species (primary microenvironment) improves the selectivity, while the engineered pore walls around PdCu2 sites (secondary microenvironment) optimize the activity.







Abstract
The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise for tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of the trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species, as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites, greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8722;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 97&#8201;% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to a modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.

The cobalt oxide cores correspond to increasingly large molecular analogues of infinite cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. They are the largest cobalt polyoxoniobates and the polyoxometalates with the greatest number of Co ions and the highest&#8208;nuclearity cobalt clusters known thus far. They are shown to be efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Only rarely have polyoxometalates been found to form core&#8211;shell nanoclusters. Here, we succeeded in isolating a series of rare giant and all&#8208;inorganic core&#8211;shell cobalt polyoxoniobates (Co&#8722;PONbs) with diverse shapes, nuclearities and original topologies, including 50&#8208;nuclearity {Co12Nb38O132}, 54&#8208;nuclearity {Co20Nb34O128}, 62&#8208;nuclearity {Co26Nb36O140} and 87&#8208;nuclearity {Co33Nb54O188}. They are the largest Co&#8722;PONbs and also the polyoxometalates containing the greatest number of Co ions and the largest cobalt clusters known thus far. These molecular Co&#8722;PONbs have intriguing and atomically precise core&#8211;shell architectures comprising unique cobalt oxide cores and niobate oxide shells. In particular, the encapsulated cobalt oxide cores with different nuclearities have identical compositions, structures and mixed&#8208;valence Co3+/Co2+ states as the different sized Co&#8722;O moieties of the bulk cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4, suggesting that they can serve as various molecular models of the cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. The successful construction of the series of the Co&#8722;PONbs reveals a feasible and versatile synthetic method for making rare core&#8211;shell heterometallic PONbs. Further, these new&#8208;type core&#8211;shell bimetal species are promising cluster molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Quadruple H&#8208;Bonding and Polyrotaxanes Dual Cross&#8208;linking Supramolecular Elastomer for High Toughness and Self&#8208;healing Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tough and self&#8208;healable elastomer is prepared through a strategy by combining quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxane dual crosslinks. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation and low&#8208;field solid state 1H&#8197;NMR confirmed the combined effect. Highly stretchable conductors based on the elastomers provide great potential for stretchable and tough electronic devices.







Abstract
Tough and self&#8208;healable substrates can enable stretchable electronics long service life. However, for substrates, it still remains a challenge to achieve both high toughness and autonomous self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Herein, a strategy by using the combined effects between quadruple H&#8208;bonding and slidable cross&#8208;links is proposed to solve the above issues in the elastomer. The elastomer exhibits high toughness (77.3&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), fracture energy (&#8776;127.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), and good healing efficiency (91&#8201;%) at room temperature. The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross&#8208;linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self&#8208;healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8211;0.26&#8197;&#937;) even at the strain of 1600&#8201;%.

         <title>Reactive Polymer as Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive surrogate polymer containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties is developed, that can form an artificial polymeric SEI (APSEI) in situ with lithium metal anodes. This APSEI greatly facilitates the induction of uniform deposition of lithium ions while suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites. The APSEI significantly improved the performance of lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes. Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named P(St&#8208;MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in situ form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St&#8208;MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900&#8197;h under 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO4 full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96&#8201;% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes. The innovative strategy of artificial SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Unbiased C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds: Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion reaction of strictly unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is described. The reaction uses readily available starting materials and benefits from extremely simple reaction conditions. A library of structurally diverse scaffolds bearing a C(sp2)&#8722;Br bond has been obtained. In addition, an original reaction pathway in gold catalysis involving a concerted insertion on a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation has been disclosed.







Abstract
Selective functionalization of non&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is a major challenge in chemistry, so functional groups are often used to enhance reactivity. Here, we present a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes without any sort of electronic, or conformational bias. The reaction proceeds regiospecifically and stereospecifically to the corresponding bromocyclopentene derivatives. The latter can be readily modified, comprising an excellent library of diverse 3D scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. In addition, a mechanistic study has shown that the reaction proceeds via a so far unknown mechanism: a concerted [1,5]&#8208;H shift / C&#8722;C bond formation involving a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation&#8208;like transition state.

Hybrid composites between nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been described as optimal materials for a wide range of applications in optical sensing, drug delivery, pollutant removal or catalysis. These materials are usually core&#8208;shell single&#8208; or multi&#8208;nanoparticles, restricting the inorganic surface available for reaction. Here, we develop a method for the preparation of yolk&#8208;shells consisting in a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with MOF. This configuration shows more colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, seems to show some interesting synergy with gold for their application in photocatalysis and present strong optical activity to be used as SERS sensors.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By accelerating the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs, enhancing the protonation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and promoting the O2 adsorption in a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; Yeager&#8208;type with enhanced adsorption energy, FS&#8208;COFs alter the photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route to the one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route, achieving efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthetic strategy, especially the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) ORR route holds great potential in achieving highly efficient and selectivity. However, efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR is rarely harvested and the underlying mechanism for regulating the ORR pathways remains greatly obscure. Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS&#8208;COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H2O2 generation via one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS&#8208;COFs exert a superb H2O2 yield of 3904.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming most reported metal&#8208;free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one&#8208;step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible and inexpensive method for linking chemical handles to the backbone of oligonucleotides during solid&#8208;phase synthesis was developed. Primary or secondary amines are linked to positions where a tert&#8208;butyl phosphoramidite is inserted by an oxidative coupling using iodine to obtain the desired phosphoramidate. With this method different functional groups such as azides, alkynes, amines were inserted as chemical handles.







Abstract
Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80&#8201;%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH&#8197;5.5 buffer.

         <title>Fabrication of Photoprocessable Materials via Photopolymerization Using an Acid&#8208;Induced Photocleavable Platinum&#8208;Acetylide Crosslinker</title>

         <dc:description>
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for the precise molding and tuning of polymer materials; however, they are incompatible with single materials because of their conflicting reactivity. Herein, the acid&#8208;induced photocleavage of a platinum&#8211;acetylide crosslinker allows the fabrication of materials via photopolymerization with 365&#8208;nm UV light as well as photoprocessing with 365&#8208;nm UV light under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for molding and tuning polymer materials. However, they are incompatible with single materials owing to their contradictory photoreactivity. Herein, an acid&#8208;induced photocleavable crosslinker, a platinum&#8211;acetylide complex covered by permethylated cyclodextrins, enables the fabrication of photoprocessable materials via photopolymerization with N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)acrylamide. The polymer networks are molded by 365&#8197;nm irradiation as well as softened and degraded by a cooperative reaction with HCl as an acidic additive under 365&#8197;nm UV light, or 470&#8197;nm visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Moreover, the crosslinker is applied to a photoadhesive triggered by 365&#8197;nm irradiation. The adhesion is detachable on&#8208;demand through acid&#8208;induced photodegradation with the same wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Thus, acid&#8208;induced photocleavage allows the integration of light&#8208;induced molding and processing under various lights of various wavelengths, opening up new strategies for polymer technologies.

The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes for double meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H transformations was achieved by metalla&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and &#963;&#8208;activation, featuring excellent site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, along with ample scope.







Abstract
Twofold distal C&#8722;H functionalization was accomplished by difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes to provide rapid access to multifunctionalized molecules. The multicomponent ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote 1,n&#8208;difunctionalization (n=6,7) of nonactivated alkenes with fluoroalkyl halides and heteroarenes in a modular manner is reported. The meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H distal functionalization featured mild conditions, unique selectivity, and broad substrate scope with a domino process for twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of the sequential formation of three different carbon&#8208;centered radicals. A plausible mechanism was proposed based on detailed experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Dithioacetal Polymers via Reversible Entropy&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydithioacetals depolymerize to a mixture of macrocycles that regenerates the parent polymers via entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization. When crosslinked, they demonstrate covalent adaptable network (CAN) behavior at elevated temperatures. The swollen CANs are also depolymerizable to macrocycles, which are polymerized back to the CANs. Polydithioacetals are thus desirable candidates as chemically recyclable thermoplastics and thermosets.







Abstract
In a sustainable circular economy, polymers capable of chemical recycling to monomers are highly desirable. We report an efficient monomer&#8208;polymer recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA). Pristine PDTAs were readily synthesized from 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alkyl dithiols. They then exhibited depolymerizability via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization into macrocycles, followed by entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) to reform the virgin polymers. High conversions were obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions. Once crosslinked, the network exhibited thermal reprocessability enabled by acid&#8208;catalyzed dithioacetal exchange. The network retained the recyclability into macrocyclic monomers in solvent which can repolymerize to regenerate the crosslinked network. These results demonstrated PDTA as a new molecular platform for the design of recyclable polymers and the advantages of ED&#8208;ROP for which polymerization is favored at higher temperatures.

         <title>Hidden Lives. Early Childhood Care as an Academic: The Slow Burn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hidden Lives series documents the &#8220;second jobs&#8221; of our colleagues, the invisible work that often goes unseen. In this first Viewpoint Article, we see the challenges of early childhood care set against the backdrop of societal shifts in caretaker roles and job responsibilities.







Abstract
As the inaugural entry in the new series Hidden Lives, this Viewpoint Article highlights challenges in early childhood care faced by academicians. Research centers must adapt to societal shifts in family structure, uncertainty around research funding, expanded job responsibilities and upheavals brought about by the pandemic. These problems represent opportunities for change at the technological, cultural and policy levels. It is crucial that we recognize those in need and help where we can.

Dual&#8208;emissive triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solvent polarity, and viscosity of the medium, are reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202303725). The intramolecularly coordinated B&#8211;X=P bond undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to bright emissions from the two different states. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

Polydithioacetals , a new class of chemically recyclable thermoplastic and thermoset polymers, depolymerize to give a mixture of homologous macrocyclic monomers. Ying Yang and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in their Research Article (e202303039) that these monomers regenerate the virgin polymer via entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization with high conversions at ambient temperatures.

A methyltransferase from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was identified and engineered for late&#8208;stage modifications of the carbon skeleton of terpenes. A variant with three changes in the amino acid sequence was able to produce methylated derivatives of linear terpenoids with high selectivity by C&#8208;methylation of an unactivated alkene. This opens new avenues for the modification of carbon scaffolds in various applications, as demonstrated by Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202301601).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the slow water dissociation process limits the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In their Research Article (e202300873), Emiliano Cort&#233;s and co&#8208;workers designed an atomically asymmetric local electric field using IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to optimize the dissociation process by tuning the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation. As a result, IrRu DSACs exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2 current density in a single cell and a high stability over 300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;A/cm2 in a membrane electrode assembly.

         <title>Small Data Can Play a Big Role in Chemical Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the paucity of reliable datasets, chemical discovery is enriched by machine learning techniques. Recent advances in data infrastructure management now prioritize high&#8208;quality data, which enable creative reinterpretation of information across contexts and disciplines. Likewise, insights resulting from analyzing small data can be fed back into big data workflows.







Abstract
The chemistry community is currently witnessing a surge of scientific discoveries in organic chemistry supported by machine learning (ML) techniques. Whereas many of these techniques were developed for big data applications, the nature of experimental organic chemistry often confines practitioners to small datasets. Herein, we touch upon the limitations associated with small data in ML and emphasize the impact of bias and variance on constructing reliable predictive models. We aim to raise awareness to these possible pitfalls, and thus, provide an introductory guideline for good practice. Ultimately, we stress the great value associated with statistical analysis of small data, which can be further boosted by adopting a holistic data&#8208;centric approach in chemistry.

Abstract
Machine learning (ML) algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. Conventionally, ML is understood as a fundamentally data&#8208;driven endeavour. Unfortunately, large well&#8208;curated databases are sparse in chemistry. In this contribution, I therefore review science&#8208;driven ML approaches which do not rely on &#8220;big data&#8221;, focusing on the atomistic modelling of materials and molecules. In this context, the term science&#8208;driven refers to approaches that begin with a scientific question and then ask what training data and model design choices are appropriate. As key features of science&#8208;driven ML, the automated and purpose&#8208;driven collection of data and the use of chemical and physical priors to achieve high data&#8208;efficiency are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate model evaluation and error estimation is emphasized.

         <title>Recent Development of SnII, SbIII&#8208;based Birefringent Material: Crystal Chemistry and Investigation of Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered SnII, SbIII&#8208;based birefringent crystals are systematically summarized in this review, including their structural chemistry, optical properties, as well as structure&#8208;properties relationships. The insight gained from this study provides guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.







Abstract
The combination of SnII or SbIII with &#960;, non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units has produced birefringent crystals with birefringence ranging from 0.005 to 0.468@1064&#8197;nm. It is proven that introducing SnII or SbIII into crystals is a feasible strategy to enlarge the birefringence, which not only promotes the miniaturization of fabricated devices, but also effectively modulates polarized light. Herein, recently discovered SnII, SbIII&#8208;based birefringent crystals with birefringence investigated are summarized, including their crystal structure and optical properties, especially birefringence. This review also presents the influence of SnII, SbIII with stereochemically active lone pair on the optical anisotropy. We hope that this work provides a clear perspective on the crystal chemistry of SnII, SbIII&#8208;based optical functional crystals and promotes the development of new birefringent crystals with large optical anisotropy.

         <title>Optimizing Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;selective membrane is the key component in reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power harvesting techniques. This Minireview provides an overview of the balance between ion selectivity (voltage) and ion permeability (current) in osmotic ion transport and offers a set of design guidelines for material parameters to optimize membrane performance to maximize osmotic power generation.







Abstract
The design of ion&#8208;selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.

     alt="Optimizing Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ion-selective membrane is the key component in reverse electrodialysis-based osmotic power harvesting techniques. This Minireview provides an overview of the balance between ion selectivity (voltage) and ion permeability (current) in osmotic ion transport and offers a set of design guidelines for material parameters to optimize membrane performance to maximize osmotic power generation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of ion-selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis-based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon ion intercalation.







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework featured with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Cihunamides, Macrocyclic Antibacterial RiPPs with a Unique C&#8722;N Linkage Formed by CYP450 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical analysis of volcanic&#8208;island&#8208;derived Streptomyces uncovered cihunamides, unique ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with antibacterial activity. Genome mining, comparative bioinformatics, and heterologous co&#8208;expression revealed that the key step for cihunamide biosynthesis is the cytochrome&#8197;P450 mediated oxidative coupling of two tryptophan residues to form an endocyclic C&#8722;N bond.







Abstract
Cihunamides&#8197;A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), novel antibacterial RiPPs, were isolated from volcanic&#8208;island&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. The structures of 1&#8211;4 were elucidated by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR, MS, and chemical derivatization; they contain a tetrapeptide core composed of WNIW, cyclized by a unique C&#8722;N linkage between two Trp units. Genome mining of the producer strain revealed two biosynthetic genes encoding a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme and a precursor peptide. Heterologous co&#8208;expression of the core genes demonstrated the biosynthesis of cihunamides through P450&#8208;mediated oxidative Trp&#8208;Trp cross&#8208;linking. Further bioinformatic analysis uncovered 252 homologous gene clusters, including that of tryptorubins, which possess a distinct Trp&#8208;Trp linkage. Cihunamides do not display the non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism shown in tryptorubins, which are the founding members of the &#8220;atropitide&#8221; family. Therefore, we propose to use a new RiPP family name, &#8220;bitryptides&#8221;, for cihunamides, tryptorubins, and their congeners, wherein the Trp&#8208;Trp linkages define the structural class rather than non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism.

         <title>Mixed Conductive, Injectable, and Fluorescent Supramolecular Eutectogel Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first example of mixed ionic/electronic conductive eutectogel composites formed from low molecular weight gelators (LMWG) combined with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate (ChS) and glycine/choline chloride (Gly/ChCl) deep eutectic solvent (DES). Eutectogels exhibit fluorescence, high combined conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatible properties to be used as injectable materials for bioimaging.







Abstract
Eutectogels are an emerging family of soft ionic materials alternative to ionic liquid gels and organogels, offering fresh perspectives for designing functional dynamic platforms in water&#8208;free environments. Herein, the first example of mixed ionic and electronic conducting supramolecular eutectogel composites is reported. A fluorescent glutamic acid&#8208;derived low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was found to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrillar networks in deep eutectic solvents (DES)/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate dispersions. These dynamic materials displayed excellent injectability and self&#8208;healing properties, high ionic conductivity (up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and fluorescence imaging ability. This set of features turns the mixed conducting supramolecular eutectogels into promising adaptive materials for bioimaging and electrostimulation applications.

         <title>Methylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Engineered Methyltransferases To Generate Non&#8208;natural Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpenoids are applied in various ways, in flavors and fragrances as well as in pharmaceuticals and plant protection. Through diversification of the carbon scaffold, non&#8208;natural terpenoids can be generated and screened for improved properties. The identification and engineering of methyltransferases for late&#8208;stage C&#8208;methylation of unactivated alkenes with high selectivity provided access to methylated derivatives of readily available terpenoids.







Abstract
Terpenoids are built from isoprene building blocks and have numerous biological functions. Selective late&#8208;stage modification of their carbon scaffold has the potential to optimize or transform their biological activities. However, the synthesis of terpenoids with a non&#8208;natural carbon scaffold is often a challenging endeavor because of the complexity of these molecules. Herein we report the identification and engineering of (S)&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent sterol methyltransferases for selective C&#8208;methylation of linear terpenoids. The engineered enzyme catalyzes selective methylation of unactivated alkenes in mono&#8208;, sesqui&#8208; and diterpenoids to produce C11, C16 and C21 derivatives. Preparative conversion and product isolation reveals that this biocatalyst performs C&#8722;C bond formation with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The alkene methylation most likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and regioselective deprotonation. This method opens new avenues for modifying the carbon scaffold of alkenes in general and terpenoids in particular.

         <title>Photochromic Polyoxoniobates with Photoinduced &#8220;D&#8208;f&#8208;A&#8221; Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a general synthetic strategy for constructing a brand&#8208;new kind of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs), organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. Fascinatingly, such composite PONbs can be reduced by M&#8208;UV irradiation to form long&#8208;term stable heteropoly blues with visible color changes in air. More fascinatingly, a unique &#8220;donor&#8208;f&#8208;bridge&#8208;acceptor&#8221; electron transfer mechanism for the reduction of the novel PONbs has been proposed and evidenced.







Abstract
Compounds with redox activities have appealing applications in catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, but the redox inert of polyoxoniobates (PONbs) significantly limits their applications for a long time. In this work, we are able to integrate organophosphate and lanthanide cluster into PONb to create the first family of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. These novel species not only present the first family of redox active PONbs that can be reduced to form long&#8208;lived &#8220;heteropoly blues&#8221; under ambient conditions, but also a new photochromic system. More importantly, the analyses of the electronic configurations and photochromic properties for a series of designed proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PONbs models allow us to discover a D&#8208;f&#8208;A electron transfer mechanism, that is, photoinduced electron is transferred from a photosensitive organophosphate electron donor (D) to the NbV electron acceptor (A) through the unoccupied 4&#8201;f&#8208;orbitals of Ln (f). This work paves the way for developing diverse PONb&#8208;based redox materials and expanding the possibility of the applications of PONbs in the redox chemistry.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrical refinement structure with self&#8208;polarizing unit possesses benchmark electrocatalytic activity towards CO2 to ethanol reduction on Cu2O@MOF/CF electrodes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of CH3CHO* for the generation of ethanol.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8722;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3&#8201;% with an energy efficiency of 27&#8201;% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.615&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Embedded in Porphyrinoids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane bridgehead positions can easily be modified to carbinols under mild conditions to yield stable and simple to handle isostere building blocks. The versatility of this approach has been illustrated by creating a new family of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two rigid scaffold units.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to obtain synthetically versatile bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives using Grignard reagents. This method allows the incorporation of BCP units in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles and the synthesis of a new class of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two BCP units. In addition, a doubly N&#8208;confused system was also formed in the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the BCP bridgeheads. The pyrrole rings in BCP containing macrocycles exist in 1,3&#8208;alternate or &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; conformations, as observed from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Pore Size Modulation in Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling High Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

The solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was used to modulate the pore size of MIL&#8208;88B, which enables to reveal the pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity of MOF materials for the first time.







Abstract
Pore size plays a critical role in determining the performance of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalysis, sensing, and gas storage or separation. However, revealing the pore&#8208;size/property relationship remains extremely challenging because ideal structure models possessing different pore sizes but having the same components are lacking. In this work, a solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was developed for modulating the ratio between the large and narrow pore phases of a flexible MOF, MIL&#8208;88B. Pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity were studied for the first time in the MIL&#8208;88B samples. The optimized MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;20&#8201;% sample showed one of the best sensing performances among all the reported MOF&#8208;based H2S&#8208;sensing materials. This work not only provides a method to synthesize ideal structure models for revealing the relationship between pore&#8208;size and properties, but also may inspire the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensing materials.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Pillared Vanadate Via Chemical Pre&#8208;Intercalation Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient NH4V4O10 (NVO) nanobelts with large interlayer spacing are fabricated as the cathode for stable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The pre&#8208;intercalated C3N4 acts as the &#8220;pillars&#8221; to enlarge the interplanar spacing for better structural stability and faster ion transfer. The abundant oxygen vacancies improve the conductivity of NVO. The obtained NVO cathode enables exceptional rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling in full cells.







Abstract
Vanadium based compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitride (C3N4) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self&#8208;engaged hydrothermal strategy. Of note, C3N4 nanosheets can act as both the nitrogen source and pre&#8208;intercalation species to transform the orthorhombic V2O5 into layered NH4V4O10 with expanded interlayer spacing. Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn2+ ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH4V4O10 cathode are promoted. As a result, the NH4V4O10 cathode delivers exceptional Zn&#8208;ion storage ability with a high specific capacity of about 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate capability of 194.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen-deficient NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (NVO) nanobelts with large interlayer spacing are fabricated as the cathode for stable aqueous zinc-ion batteries. The pre-intercalated C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the &#8220;pillars&#8221; to enlarge the interplanar spacing for better structural stability and faster ion transfer. The abundant oxygen vacancies improve the conductivity of NVO. The obtained NVO cathode enables exceptional rate capability and long-term cycling in full cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanadium based compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc (Zn)-ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen-deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitride (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self-engaged hydrothermal strategy.

Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cathode are promoted.

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of defective [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28) nanoclusters (NCs) on a gram scale has been developed. The surface vacancy on one of the vertices of Cu28 was systematically investigated at the atomic level and Cu28 can act as an effective and selective catalyst for Sonogashira C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under visible&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle's electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report the synthesis of novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Construction of Thioamide Peptides from Chiral Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward linking of natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane was established to construct various thioamide&#8208;containing peptides. The carbonyl group is replaced with a thiono group by sequential activation, and the chirality of the amino acid component is maintained in the products.







Abstract
Thioamide peptides were synthesized in a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that the trichlorosilane enables the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8722;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded the thioamide peptides. The potential applications of these thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.

         <title>The Elusive Structure of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride Determined by Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Levocetirizine dihydrochloride is a widely known antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that is effectively used for the relief of allergic symptoms in patients of various age groups. Despite its usage in such medications for more than two decades, its crystal structure has yet to be determined unambiguously. Electron diffraction is used here to determine its crystal structure.







Abstract
Levocetirizine is an orally administrated, second&#8208;generation antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been used to treat symptoms of allergy and long&#8208;term hives for over 25&#8197;years. Despite the wide use of this compound, its crystal structure has remained unknown. Here we report the application of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED)/Micro&#8208;crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the crystal structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride directly from crystalline powders that were extracted from commercially available tablets containing the compound. We also showcase the utility of dynamical refinement to unambiguously assign absolute configuration. The results highlight the immense potential of 3D ED/MicroED for structure elucidation of components of microcrystalline mixtures that obviates the need to grow large&#8208;size single crystals and the use of complementary analytical techniques, which could be important for identification as well as for primary structural characterization.

         <title>Stiba&#8208;, Arsa&#8208; and Phosphastannenes: Syntheses and Reactivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

Stibastannene featuring a Sn=Sb double bond together with homologous phospha&#8208; and arsastannene were synthesized by chloride abstraction from the respective pnictinidenes. The pnictastannene cations exhibit coordination at palladium phosphine fragments and can undergo cycloaddition reactions with dimethylbutadiene and phosphaalkyne.







Abstract
A facile synthesis for unprecedented stibastannene (10) featuring a Sn=Sb&#8208;double bond together with the homologous arsa&#8208; (9) and phosphastannenes (8) is presented. Chloride abstraction from respective stannyl pnictinidenes [E=P (5), As (6), Sb (7)], which were made accessible by reduction of ECl3 addition products at an intramolecular phosphine&#8208;stabilized stannylene, gave the pnictastannenes in moderate yields. The pnictastannenes coordinate Pd(PPh3)2 fragments (12&#8211;14) and the phosphastannene forms also a nickel coordination compound with the Ni(PPh3)2&#8208;fragment (11). 2,3&#8208;Dimethylbutadiene shows a [2+4]&#8208;cycloaddition (15&#8211;17) in reaction with the pnictastannenes (8&#8211;10). Products of a [2+2]&#8208;addition (18, 19) were isolated as the phosphaalkyne reaction products for 8 and 9. Addition of an O&#8722;H bond at the Sn=P&#8208;bond was found in reaction of water with phosphastannene 8. Reaction with ammonia afforded the NH3&#8208;adducts (21&#8211;23) at the tin atom for pnictastannenes 8&#8211;10. Only in the case of the arsastannene an azide reaction product featuring a three membered Sn&#8722;As&#8722;N&#8208;ring was obtained.

The pnictastannenes coordinate Pd(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fragments (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;) and the phosphastannene forms also a nickel coordination compound with the Ni(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fragment (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;). 2,3-Dimethylbutadiene shows a [2+4]-cycloaddition (&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt;) in reaction with the pnictastannenes (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;). Products of a [2+2]-addition (&lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;19&lt;/b&gt;) were isolated as the phosphaalkyne reaction products for &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;. Addition of an O&#8722;H bond at the Sn=P-bond was found in reaction of water with phosphastannene &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;. Reaction with ammonia afforded the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adducts (&lt;b&gt;21&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;23&lt;/b&gt;) at the tin atom for pnictastannenes &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;. Only in the case of the arsastannene an azide reaction product featuring a three membered Sn&#8722;As&#8722;N-ring was obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Applied Mass Spectrometry Team at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS Mannheim) in Germany. They recently published an article together with Sirius Fine Chemicals SiChem GmbH and Bruker Daltonics. The work presents a novel concept for vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrices that enable long MALDI mass spectrometry measurements (e.g., for imaging) of at least 72&#8197;hours. Through the use of a photo&#8208;removable group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable one. The protecting group can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then the matrix performs in the same way as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP. &#8220;A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging&#8221;, Q.

         <title>Molecular orbital delocalization enhanced charge transfer in &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic semiconductors are promising materials for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;active substrates based on the tunability of electronic structures and molecular orbitals. Herein, we investigate the effect of the temperature&#8208;mediated resonance structure transitions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films on the interactions between substrate and probe molecules, thereby affecting the SERS activity. Absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations show that this effect occurs mainly due to delocalization of the electron distribution in molecular orbitals, effectively promoting the charge transfer between the semiconductor and probe molecules. In this work, we investigate for the first time the effect of electron delocalization in molecular orbitals on SERS activity, which will provide new design ideas for the development of highly sensitive SERS substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of the O&#8208;antigen of A. baumannii ATCC 17961 Using Long&#8208;Range Levulinoyl Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we described the first synthesis of pentasaccharide and decasaccharide of A. baumannii ATCC 17961 O&#8208;antigen for developing a synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine against A. baumannii infection. The efficient synthesis of the rare sugar 2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;glucuronate was achieved using our recently introduced organocatalytic glycosylation method. We found, for the first time, that long&#8208;range levulinoyl group participation via a hydrogen bond can result in a significantly improved &#946;&#8208;selectivity in glycosylations. This solves the stereoselectivity problem of highly branched galactose acceptors. The proposed mechanism was supported by control experiments and DFT computations. Benefiting from the long&#8208;range levulinoyl group participation strategy, pentasaccharide donor and acceptor were obtained via an efficient [2 + 1 + 2] one&#8208;pot glycosylation method, which were used for the target decasaccharide synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling (eXEC) Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemistry utilizes electrons as a potent, controllable, and traceless alternative to chemical oxidants or reductants, and typically offers a more sustainable option for achieving selective organic synthesis. Recently, the merger of electrochemistry with readily available electrophiles has been recognized as a viable and increasingly popular methodology for efficiently constructing challenging C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds in a sustainable manner for complex organic molecules. In this mini&#8208;review, we have systematically summarized the most recent advances in electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) reactions during the last decade. Our focus has been on readily available electrophiles, including aryl and alkyl organic (pseudo)halides, as well as small molecules such as CO2, SO2, and D2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Bimetallic Catalysis via One&#8208;Metal/Two&#8208;Ligands: Mechanistic Insights of Polyfluoroarylation&#8208;Allylation of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal/ligand in situ assembly is often crucial for tailoring the reactivity &amp; selectivity in transition metal catalysis. Although cooperative bimetallic catalysis has been applied as a powerful strategy in new reaction development, cooperative catalysis via a single metal/two ligands is still underdeveloped, since it is rather challenging to harness the distinct reactivity profiles of the species generated by self&#8208;assembly of a single metal precursor with a mixture of different ligands. Herein, we report a catalytic system composed of a single metal/two ligands for a three&#8208;component reaction of polyfluoroarene, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and allylic electrophile, leading to highly efficient construction of densely functionalized quaternary carbon centers, that are otherwise hardly accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest this reaction follows a cooperative bimetallic pathway via two catalysts with distinct reactivity profiles, which are assembled in situ from a single metal precursor and two ligands and work in concert to escort the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Stabilities of Tetravalent Cerium, Uranium, and Neptunium Imidophosphorane Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of the redox chemistry of mid&#8208;actinides (U &#8211; Pu) has historically relied on cerium as a model, due to the accessibility of trivalent and tetravalent oxidation states for these ions. Recently, dramatic shifts of lanthanide 4+/3+ non&#8208;aqueous redox couples have been established within a homoleptic imidophosphorane ligand framework. Herein we extend the chemistry of the imidophosphorane ligand (NPC = [N=PtBu(pyrr)2]&#8722;; pyrr = pyrrolidinyl) to tetrahomoleptic NPC complexes of neptunium and cerium (1&#8208;M, 2&#8208;M, M = Np, Ce) and present comparative structural, electrochemical, and theoretical studies of these complexes. Large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M = Ce, U, Np) couples underpin the stabilization of higher metal oxidation states owing to the strongly donating nature of the NPC ligands, providing access to the U5+/4+, U6+/5+, and to an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. The differences in the chemical redox properties of the U vs. Ce and Np complexes are rationalized based on their redox potentials, degree of structural rearrangement upon reduction/oxidation, relative molecular orbital energies, and orbital composition analyses employing density functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Triggered Structural Defects in Au44 Homologues Boost Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The systematic induction of structural defects at the atomic level is crucial to metal nanocluster research because it endows cluster&#8208;based catalysts with highly reactive centers and allows for a comprehensive investigation of viable reaction pathways. Herein, by substituting neutral phosphine ligands for surface anionic thiolate ligands, we establish that one or two Au3 triangular units can be successfully introduced into the double&#8208;stranded helical kernel of Au44(TBBT)28, where TBBT = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzenethiolate, resulting in the formation of two atomically precise defective Au44 nanoclusters. Along with the regular face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) nanocluster, the first series of mixed&#8208;ligand cluster homologues is identified, with a unified formula of Au44(PPh3)n(TBBT)28&#8208;2n (n = 0&#8211;2). The Au44(PPh3)(TBBT)26 nanocluster having major structural defects at the bottom of the fcc lattice demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction to CO. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the active site near the defects significantly lowers the free energy for the *COOH formation, the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Light&#8208;Enabled Access to &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Application in the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allyl Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operationally simple strategies to assemble boron containing organic frameworks are highly enabling in organic synthesis. While conventional retrosynthetic logic has engendered many platforms focusing on the direct formation of C&#8211;B bonds, &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals have recently reemerged as versatile open&#8208;shell alternatives to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8211;C bond formation. Direct light&#8208;enabled &#945;&#8208;activation is currently contingent on photo&#8208; or transition metal&#8208;catalysis activation to efficiently generate radical species. Here, we disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using only visible light and a simple Lewis base to enable homolytic scission. Intermolecular addition to styrenes facilitates the rapid construction of highly versatile E&#8208;allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger of this construct with selective energy transfer catalysis to enable the complimentary stereodivergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronic esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Characterization and Cyclization Mechanism of a Diterpene Synthase Catalyzing the Skeleton Formation of Cephalotane&#8208;type Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CsCTS, a new diterpene synthase from Cephalotaxus sinensis, responsible for forming cephalotene (1), the core skeleton of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids with highly rigid 6/6/5/7 tetracyclic ring system, was functionally characterized. The stepwise cyclization mechanism is proposed mainly based on structural investigation of its derailment products, and further demonstrated through isotopic labeling experiments and density functional theory calculations. Homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation combined with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis reveal the critical amino acid residues for the unique carbocation&#8208;driven cascade cyclization mechanism of CsCTS. Altogether, this study reports the discovery of the diterpene synthase that catalyzes the first committed step of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid biosynthesis and delineates its cyclization mechanism, laying the foundation to decipher and artificially construct the complete biosynthetic pathway of this type diterpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Purely Organic Fluorescence Afterglow: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitation, Inherent Mechanism, Tunable Color, and Practical Applications with Very Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient approach of constructing fluorescence afterglow materials triggered by visible light was presented. By dispersing fluorescent dyes with coplanar and rigid chemical structure into matrixes with multiple hydroxyl groups, bright and color tunable fluorescence afterglow was achieved after the cease of white light. The mechanism was investigated, and the aqueous solution of the dye was used for low&#8208;cost anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Purely organic materials with visible light excitable fluorescence afterglow are promising for applications. Herein, fluorescence afterglow with various intensity and duration was observed on fluorescent dyes once being dispersed in polymer matrix, thanks to the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) and long delayed fluorescence lifetime (&#964;DF) derived from the coplanar and rigid chemical structure of the dyes. To verify the mechanism, different polymers were used to tune singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy based on solvent effect. And commercial acriflavine (Acf) film showed blue shifted fluorescence compared to purified one, with slower kRISC (&#8776;100&#8197;s&#8722;1) and longer &#964;DF (0.6&#8197;s). Via energy transfer from Acf to rhodamine B, the afterglow color was further regulated, with the largest fluorescence quantum yield of 42.4&#8201;%. It was demonstrated that the materials worked on color tunable light sources, and low&#8208;cost ($2 for 50&#8201;000&#8197;labels) anti&#8208;counterfeit labels recognized by white light.

         <title>Easily Scalable Shell&#8208;Structured Copper Catalyst with High Activity and Durability for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous ceria shell was formed on small Cu nanoparticles with a size of &#8804;10&#8197;nm by promoting the surface oxygen transfer. This catalyst presented high activity and durability for CO2 hydrogenation. It could be easily scaled&#8208;up and applied in a bench&#8208;scale reactor, achieving a high CO production rate.







Abstract
Inducing strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) has been a useful way to control the structure of surface active sites. The SMSI often causes the encapsulation of metal particles with an oxide layer. Herein, an amorphous ceria shell was formed on Cu nanoparticles under a mild gas condition with high activity and durability for surface reaction. Cu&#8722;Ce solid solution promoted the transfer of surface oxygen species, which induced the ceria shell formation on Cu nanoparticles. This catalyst was used for CO2 hydrogenation, selectively producing CO with high low&#8208;temperature activity and good durability for operation at high temperature. CO2 activation and H2 spillover could occur at low temperatures, enhancing the activity. The shell prevented the sintering, assuring durability. This catalyst was applied to a bench&#8208;scale reactor without loss in performance, resulting in high CO productivity in all temperature ranges.

         <title>Conformationally Locked Cyclo[2]Dipyrrins Linked with Anthracene Subunits: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracene&#8208;containing helically locked &#8216;Figure of eight&#8217; expanded porphyrin has been obtained by a simple condensation strategy. The 3D crystal packing showed the presence of two helical enantiomers, which were stable enough to be separated in solution. The P,P and M,M enantiomers show moderate chiroptical properties (gabs ca.10&#8722;3 and glum=3.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 700&#8197;nm) and are not interconvertible, presumably because of a high racemization barrier.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of anthracene&#8208;containing twisted cyclo[2]dipyrrin 1 by utilizing a non&#8208;planar building block, 1,5&#8208;dipyrrylanthracene (1,5&#8208;DPA). The non&#8208;planar nature of the macrocycle enhanced the solubility and helped in structural characterization. Macrocycle 1 adopts a twisted &#8216;figure of eight&#8217; conformation stabilized by strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions and exists as a pair of helical enantiomers, as revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. More importantly, the sterically locked structure enabled facile optical resolution using chiral HPLC. The (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomers show moderate chiroptical properties, such as absorption dissymmetry factors |gabs| in the order of 10&#8722;3, and luminescence dissymmetry factors |glum| of 3.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and 2.9&#215;10&#8722;3 at 702&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <title>Single Atom Bi Decorated Copper Alloy Enables C&#8722;C Coupling for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 into C2+ Products
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single atom Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) was prepared for the first time to enable the C&#8722;C coupling, resulting in selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products with faraday efficiency of ca. 73&#8201;%.







Abstract
Single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have been recently explored for promotion of various heterogeneous catalysis, but it remains unexplored for selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products involving C&#8722;C coupling. Herein we report a single&#8208;atomic Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) electrocatalyst that could effectively modulate selectivity of CO2 reduction into C2+ products instead of previous C1 ones. The BiCu&#8208;SAA catalyst exhibits remarkably superior selectivity of C2+ products with optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.4&#8201;% compared to the pure copper nanoparticle or Bi nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Cu nanocomposites, and its structure and performance can be well maintained at current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the flow cell system. Based on our in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the BiCu&#8208;SAA is found to favor the activation of CO2 and subsequent C&#8722;C coupling during the electrocatalytic reaction, as should be responsible for its extraordinary C2+ selectivity.

         <title>Synergic Electron and Defect Compensation Minimizes Voltage Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn perovskite solar cells have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the Sn perovskites are notorious to feature heavy p&#8208;doping characteristics and possess abundant vacancy defects, which resulted in under&#8208;optimized interfacial energy level alignment and severe nonradiative recombination. Here, we reported a synergic &#8220;electron and defect compensation&#8221; strategy to simultaneously modulate the electronic structures and defect profiles of Sn perovskites via incorporating a traced amount (0.1 mol%) of heterovalent metal halide salts. Consequently, the doping level of modified Sn perovskites was altered from heavy p&#8208;type to weak p&#8208;type (i.e. up&#8208;shifting the Fermi Level by ~ 0.12 eV) that determinately reducing the barrier of interfacial charge extraction and effectively suppressing the charge recombination loss throughout the bulk perovskite film and at relevant interfaces. Pioneeringly, the resultant device modified with electron and defect compensation realized a champion efficiency of 14.02%, which is ~46% higher than that of control device (9.56%). Notably, a record&#8208;high photovoltage of 1.013 V was attained, corresponding to the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38 eV reported to date, and narrowing the gap with Pb&#8208;based analogues (~ 0.30 V).</dc:description>

         <title>Dissection of the Catalytic Mechanisms of Transmembrane Terpene Cyclases Involved in Fungal Meroterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic function of the terpene cyclase AdrI, which cyclizes (6R,10&#8242;R)&#8208;epoxyfarnesyl&#8208;DMOA methyl ester (1) into andrastin&#8197;E (2), was investigated using its AlphaFold2&#8208;generated protein model. This revealed several amino acid residues that are required for reaction initiation and product selectivity. Moreover, a comparison of AdrI with homologues that also cyclize 1 afforded insight into how these cyclases yield diverse cyclized products.







Abstract
Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases are noncanonical transmembrane terpene cyclases involved in the biosynthesis of microbial meroterpenoids and catalyze diverse cyclization reactions. Despite the ubiquity of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases in microorganisms, their three&#8208;dimensional structures have never been experimentally determined. Herein, we focused on AdrI, the Pyr4&#8208;family enzyme for the andrastin A pathway, and its homologues, and performed a series of mutational experiments using their AlphaFold2&#8208;generated structures. Intriguingly, we found that AdrI and InsA7, which both accept the same substrate, use different amino acid residues for the initiation of the cyclization cascade. Furthermore, we obtained several AdrI variants with altered product selectivity, one of which dominantly yielded a new meroterpenoid species. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the catalytic functions of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases and will facilitate the engineering of these enzymes.

         <title>Beyond Solvothermal: Alternative Synthetic Methods for Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a comprehensive overview of the recent synthetic advancements of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with emphasis on the energy input required. These emerging strategies encompass microwave&#8208;assisted, sonochemical, mechanochemical, photochemical, plasma&#8208;promoted, electric field&#8208;induced, and electron beam&#8208;mediated synthesis. We also delve into the merits and limitations of these methods in comparison to the solvothermal approach.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous organic materials that hold a wealth of potential applications across various fields. The development of COFs, however, is significantly impeded by the dearth of efficient synthetic methods. The traditional solvothermal approach, while prevalent, is fraught with challenges such as complicated processes, excessive energy consumption, long reaction times, and limited scalability, rendering it unsuitable for practical applications. The quest for simpler, quicker, more energy&#8208;efficient, and environmentally benign synthetic strategies is thus paramount for bridging the gap between academic COF chemistry and industrial application. This Review provides an overview of the recent advances in alternative COF synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on energy input. We discuss representative examples of COF synthesis facilitated by microwave, ultrasound, mechanic force, light, plasma, electric field, and electron beam. Perspectives on the advantages and limitations of these methods against the traditional solvothermal approach are highlighted.

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Mediated Profiling of Viral RNA at Single&#8208;Nucleotide Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) is reported for rapid and ultrasensitive detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants. By combining CRISPR technology with highly sensitive field&#8208;effect transistor arrays, CAVRED demonstrated RT&#8208;PCR&#8208;equivalent sensitivity without preamplification and achieved simultaneous profiling of 9 critical RNA mutations associated with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern at single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.







Abstract
Mass pathogen screening is critical to preventing the outbreaks and spread of infectious diseases. The large&#8208;scale epidemic of COVID&#8208;19 and the rapid mutation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) virus have put forward new requirements for virus detection and identification techniques. Here, we report a CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) for the rapid detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants. A series of CRISPR RNA assays were designed to amplify the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system&#8216;s ability to discriminate between mutant and wild RNA genomes with a single&#8208;nucleotide difference. The identified viral RNA information was converted into readable electrical signals through field&#8208;effect transistor biosensors for the achievement of highly sensitive detection of single&#8208;base mutations. CAVRED can detect the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus genome as low as 1&#8197;cp&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1 within 20&#8197;mins without amplification, and this value is comparable to the detection limit of real&#8208;time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Based on the excellent RNA mutation detection ability, an 8&#8208;in&#8208;1 CAVRED array was constructed and realized the rapid identification of 40 simulated throat swab samples of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants with a 95.0&#8201;% accuracy. The advantages of accuracy, sensitivity, and fast speed of CAVRED promise its application in rapid and large&#8208;scale epidemic screening.

         <title>A Cleavable Crosslinking Strategy for Commodity Polymer Functionalization and Generation of Reprocessable Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cleavable bis&#8208;diazirine crosslinkers can be used to upgrade commodity, aliphatic polymers into reprocessable thermosets. The method also provides a convenient means to introduce new functionality into polymers, through facile C&#8722;H insertion followed by hydrolysis.







Abstract
Covalently crosslinked polymeric materials, known as thermosets, possess enhanced mechanical strength and thermal stability relative to the corresponding uncrosslinked thermoplastics. However, the presence of covalent inter&#8208;chain crosslinks that makes thermosets so attractive is precisely what makes them so difficult to reprocess and recycle. Here, we demonstrate the introduction of chemically cleavable groups into a bis&#8208;diazirine crosslinker. Application of this cleavable crosslinker reagent to commercial low&#8208;functionality polyolefins (or to a small&#8208;molecule model) results in the rapid, efficient introduction of molecular crosslinks that can be uncoupled by specific chemical inputs. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept findings provide one potential strategy for circularization of the thermoplastic/thermoset plastics economy, and may allow crosslinked polyolefins to be manufactured, used, reprocessed, and re&#8208;used without losing value. As an added benefit, the method allows the ready introduction of functionality into non&#8208;functionalized commodity polymers.

         <title>A Proximity&#8208;Induced Fluorogenic Reaction Triggered by Antibody&#8211;Antigen Interactions with Adjacent Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction by using two monoclonal antibodies to interact with different epitopes of an antigen. Accelerated reaction was observed using a fluorescence&#8208;based method and the importance of epitope selection was demonstrated.







Abstract
Proximity&#8208;induced chemical reactions are site&#8208;specific and rapid by taking advantage of their high affinity and highly selective interactions with the template. However, reactions induced solely by antibody&#8211;antigen interactions have not been developed. Herein, we propose a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER) as a novel template reaction. In BATER, reactive functional groups are conjugated to two antibodies that interact with two epitopes of the same antigen to accelerate the reaction. We developed a method for visualizing the progress of BATER using fluorogenic click chemistry for optimal antibody selection and linker design. The reaction is accelerated in the presence of a specific antigen in a linker length&#8208;dependent manner. The choice of the antibody epitope is important for a rapid reaction. This design will lead to various applications of BATER in living systems.

         <title>Fast and Tunable Phosphorescence from Organic Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence mechanism of crystalline diphosphonium iodide salts strongly depends on anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the case of iodide&#8211;&#960; charge transfer combined with electrostatically controlled packing effects, high quantum yields (&#934;em up to 0.75) and fast radiative rate constants (kr of up to 2.77&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) of phosphorescence have been realized at room temperature, which are exceptionally rare for metal&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
Crystalline diphosphonium iodides [MeR2P&#8208;spacer&#8208;R2Me]I with phenylene (1, 2), naphthalene (3, 4), biphenyl (5) and anthracene (6) as aromatic spacers, are photoemissive under ambient conditions. The emission colors (&#955;em values from 550 to 880&#8197;nm) and intensities (&#934;em reaching 0.75) are defined by the composition and substitution geometry of the central conjugated chromophore motif, and the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Time&#8208;resolved and variable&#8208;temperature luminescence studies suggest phosphorescence for all the titled compounds, which demonstrate observed lifetimes of 0.46&#8211;92.23&#8197;&#956;s at 297&#8197;K. Radiative rate constants kr as high as 2.8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 deduced for salts 1&#8211;3 were assigned to strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhanced by an external heavy atom effect arising from the anion&#8208;&#960; charge&#8208;transfer character of the triplet excited state. These rates of anomalously fast metal&#8208;free phosphorescence are comparable to those of transition metal complexes and organic luminophores that utilize triplet excitons via a thermally activated delayed fluorescence mechanism, making such ionic luminophores a new paradigm for the design of photofunctional and responsive molecular materials.

         <title>NIR Clusteroluminescence of Non&#8208;conjugated Phenolic Resins Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonconjugated luminescent materials derived from well&#8208;developed engineering plastic of phenolic resins could fluoresce from deep blue to the NIR region. This remarkable luminescence is attributed to through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) and can be manipulated using two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing D/A groups. The NIR emission endows phenolic resins with practical values as luminescence materials and is a breakthrough in clusteroluminescence from nonconjugated materials.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) and through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) of non&#8208;conjugated molecules have drawn more attention due to their unique photophysical behaviors that are different from largely conjugated luminogens. However, achieving red and even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission from such systems is still challenging due to the intrinsic drawbacks of non&#8208;conjugated molecules and the lack of theories for structure&#8211;property relationships. In this work, six phenolic resins are designed and synthesized based on two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing groups. All phenolic resins are verified as luminogens with CL property (CLgens), and the first example of CLgens with NIR emission (maximum emission wavelength &#8805;680&#8197;nm) and high absolute quantum yield (47&#8201;%) is reported. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal that two TSIs types, through&#8208;space locally excited state and through&#8208;space charge transfer state, play essential roles in achieving CL from these non&#8208;conjugated polymers, which could be manipulated via changing structural conformation and electron density or altering electron transition behaviors. This work not only provides an approach to manipulate TSIs and CL of non&#8208;conjugated polymers but also endows commercially available phenolic resins with high practical value as luminescence materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells Containing Pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;Core&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors with Optimized Orbit Overlap Lengths and Molecular Packing</title>

         <dc:description>
We developed a series of SMAs with pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline (PyQx) as new electron&#8208;deficient unit by combining with the strategy of cascade chlorination, namely Py1, Py2, Py3, Py4 and Py5. Py2&#8208;based device yields the best device performance due to the better molecular packing and aggregation behaviors induced by large dipole moments, small &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances and extended orbit overlap lengths in dimers.







Abstract
The central core in A&#8208;DA1D&#8208;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptor (SMAs) plays an important role in determining the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), while the principles governing the efficient design of SMAs remain elusive. Herein, we developed a series of SMAs with pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline (PyQx) as new electron&#8208;deficient unit by combining with the cascade&#8208;chlorination strategy, namely Py1, Py2, Py3, Py4 and Py5. The introduction of chlorine atoms reduces the intramolecular charge transfer effects but elevates the LUMO values. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that Py2 with ortho chlorine substituted PyQx and Py5 with two chlorine atoms yield larger dipole moments and smaller &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances, as compared with the other three acceptors. Moreover, Py2 shows the strongest light absorption capability induced by extended orbit overlap lengths and more efficient packing structures in the dimers. These features endow the best device performance of Py2 due to the better molecular packing and aggregation behaviors, more suitable domain sizes with better exciton dissociation and charge recombination. This study highlights the significance of incorporating large dipole moments, small &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances and extended orbit overlap lengths in dimers into the development of high&#8208;performance SMAs, providing insight into the design of efficient A&#8208;DA1D&#8208;A&#8208;type SMAs for OSCs.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of p&#8211;type Organics for Zinc Batteries with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular tailoring of p&#8208;type organics for zinc batteries is achieved by coupling a triphenylamine unit and a phenothiazine unit. The p&#8208;type organic electrodes reach excellent stability (2000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (1.3&#8197;V) and high capacity (145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials are known for their high redox voltages and fast kinetics. However, single&#8208;electron p&#8208;type organic materials generally exhibit low capacity despite high operating voltage and stability, while some multi&#8208;electron p&#8208;type organic materials have high theoretical capacity but low stability. To address this challenge, we explore the possibility of combining single&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;electron units to create high&#8208;capacity and stable p&#8208;type organic electrodes. We demonstrate the design of a new molecule, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazine&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyl) bis (N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline) (PTZAN), which is created by coupling the triphenylamine molecule and the phenothiazine molecule. The resulting PTZAN||Zn battery shows excellent stability (2000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (1.3&#8197;V), high capacity (145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and energy density of 187.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ analysis reveal that the charge storage of the PTZAN electrode is mainly driven by the redox of phenothiazine heterocycles and triphenylamine unit, accompanied by the combination/release of anions and Zn2+.

         <title>Ordered and Fast Ion Transport of Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Electrolyte with Regulated Coordination Strength for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the coordination strength of Li+ on the functional groups of a 3D network polymer and liquid solvent, the ionic conductivity of the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte can approach to that of liquid electrolytes in lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymer based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSE) has attracted great attention due to its assurance for high safety of rechargeable batteries including lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, it faces the issue of low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer between QSE and lithium anode. Herein, we firstly demonstrate that the ordered and fast transport of lithium ion (Li+) can be realized in QSE. Due to the higher coordination strength of Li+ on tertiary amine (&#8722;NR3) group of polymer network than that on carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of ester solvent, Li+ can diffuse orderly and quickly on &#8722;NR3 of polymer, significantly increasing the ionic conductivity of QSE to 3.69&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, &#8722;NR3 of polymer can induce in situ and uniform generation of Li3N and LiNxOy in SEI. As a result, the Li||NCM811 batteries (50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil) with this QSE show an excellent stability of 220&#8197;cycles at &#8776;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 5 times to those with conventional QSE. LMBs with LiFePO4 can stably run for &#8776;8300&#8197;h. This work demonstrates an attractive concept for improving ionic conductivity of QSE, and also provides an important step for developing advanced LMB with high cycle stability and safety.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Polyethylene Hydrocracking over Two&#8208;Dimensional Platinum&#8208;Anchored Tungsten Trioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical upcycling of polyethylene (PE) can convert plastic waste into valuable resources. However, engineering a catalyst that allows PE decomposition at low temperatures with high activity remains a significant challenge. Herein, we anchored 0.2 wt.% platinum (Pt) on defective  two&#8208;dimensional tungsten trioxide (2D WO3) nanosheets and achieved hydrocracking of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) waste at 200&#8208;250 &#176;C with a liquid fuel (C5&#8208;18) formation rate up to 1456 gproducts&#8729;gmetal species&#8722;1&#8729;h&#8722;1. The reaction pathway over the bifunctional 2D Pt/WO3 is elucidated by quasi&#8208;operando transmission infrared spectroscopy, where (I) well&#8208;dispersed Pt immobilized on 2D WO3 nanosheet triggers the dissociation of hydrogen; (II) adsorption of PE and activation of C&#8208;C cleavage on WO3 are through the formation of C=O/C=C intermediates; (III) intermediates are converted to alkane products by the dissociated H. Our study directly illustrates the synergistic role of bifunctional Pt/WO3 catalyst in the hydrocracking of HDPE, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with the optimized chemical and morphological properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the copper&#8208;catalyzed, regioselective, and stereospecific alkylation of unbiased internal allylic carbonates with functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit high stereospecificity and regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8217; products under two sets of copper&#8208;catalyzed conditions, which enables the preparation of a broad range of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Evolution of Piperazic Acid Incorporation by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering of biosynthetic enzymes is increasingly employed to synthesize structural analogues of antibiotics. Of special interest are non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) responsible for production of important antimicrobial peptides. Here, directed evolution of an adenylation domain of a Pro&#8208;specific NRPS module completely switched substrate specificity to the non&#8208;standard amino acid piperazic acid (Piz) bearing a labile N&#8208;N bond. This success was achieved by UPLC&#8208;MS/MS based screening of small, rationally designed mutant libraries and can presumably be replicated with a larger number of substrates and NRPS modules. The evolved NRPS produces a Piz&#8208;derived gramicidin S analogue. Thus, we give new impetus to the too&#8208;early dismissed idea that widely accessible low&#8208;throughput methods can switch the specificity of NRPSs in a biosynthetically useful fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Chiral Three&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral three&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (3D HOIPs) would show unique chiroptoelectronic performance due to the combination of chirality and 3D structure. However, the synthesis of 3D chiral HOIPs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we constructed a pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylammonium, EA = ethylammonium), in which the large chiral cations can be contained in the big &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic frameworks induced by mixing cations. Notably, 3D 1&#8208;R/S shows natural chiroptical activity, as evidenced by its significant mirror circular dichroism spectra and the ability to distinguish circularly polarized light. Moreover, based on the unique 3D structure, 1&#8208;S presents sensitive X&#8208;ray detection performance with a low detection limit of 398 n Gyair s&#8208;1, which is 14 times lower than the regular medical diagnosis of 5.5 &#956; Gyair s&#8208;1. In this work, 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provide a new route to develop chiral material in spin electronics and photoelectronic.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular&#8208;Approach Synthesis of Giant Molecule Acceptors via Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Knoevenagel Condensation for Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operational stability of polymer solar cells is a critical concern with respect to the thermodynamic relaxation of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) or A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs) within their blends with polymer donors. Giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) bearing SMAs as subunits offer a solution to this issue, while their classical synthesis via the Stille coupling suffers from low reaction efficiency and difficulty in obtaining mono&#8208;brominated SMA, rendering the approach impractical for their large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost preparation. In this study, we present a simple and cost&#8208;effective solution to this challenge through Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation with boron trifluoride etherate (BF3&#8729;OEt2) as catalyst. We demonstrated that the coupling of the monoaldehyde&#8208;terminated A&#8208;D&#8208;CHO unit and the methylene&#8208;based A&#8208;link&#8208;A (or its silyl enol ether counterpart) substrates can be quantitatively achieved within 30 minutes in the presence of acetic anhydride, affording a variety of GMAs connected via the flexible and conjugated linkers. The photophysical properties was fully studied, yielding a high device efficiency of over 18%. Our findings offer a promising alternative for the modular synthesis of GMAs with high yields, easier work up, and the widespread application of such methodology will undoubtedly accelerate the progress of stable polymer solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Evolution of Giant Polyoxometalate: From &#8220;Keplerate&#8221; to &#8220;Lantern&#8221; Type Mo132 for Improved Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural variants of high&#8208;nuclearity clusters are extremely important for their modular assembly study and functional expansion, yet the synthesis of such giant structural variants remains a great challenge. Herein, we prepared a lantern&#8208;type giant polymolybdate cluster (L&#8208;Mo132) containing equal metal nuclearity with the famous Keplerate type Mo132 (K&#8208;Mo132). The skeleton of L&#8208;Mo132 features a rare truncated rhombic triacontrahedron, which is totally different with the truncated icosahedral K&#8208;Mo132. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to observe such structural variants in high&#8208;nuclearity cluster built up of more than 100 metal atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that L&#8208;Mo132 has good stability. More importantly, because the pentagonal [Mo6O27]n&#8208; building blocks in L&#8208;Mo132 are concave instead of convex in the outer face, it contains multiple terminal coordinated water molecules on its outer surface, which make it expose more active metal sites to display superior phenol oxidation performance, which is more higher than that of K&#8208;Mo132 coordinated in M=O bonds on the outer surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Fused Sterically Shielded Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep Blue OLEDs with Reduced Dexter Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission and suppressed intermolecular interactions is challenging for realizing high color purity and stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a sterically shielded yet extremely rigid emitter based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core (Tp&#8208;DABNA) is proposed to address the issue. Tp&#8208;DABNA exhibits intense deep blue emissions with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a high horizontal transition dipole ratio, superior to the well&#8208;known bulky emitter, t&#8208;DABNA. The rigid MR skeleton of Tp&#8208;DABNA suppresses structural relaxation in the excited state, with reduced contributions from the medium&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrational modes to spectral broadening. The hyperfluorescence (HF) film composed of a sensitizer and Tp&#8208;DABNA shows reduced Dexter energy transfer compared to those of t&#8208;DABNA and DABNA&#8208;1. Notably, deep blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs with the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter display higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax = 24.8%) and narrower FWHMs (&lt; 26 nm) than t&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based OLEDs (EQEmax = 19.8%). The HF&#8208;OLEDs based on the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter further demonstrate improved performance with an EQEmax of 28.7% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into the Interlayer Characteristics and Oxygen Reactivity of Bilayer Borophene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bilayer (BL) two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) has recently been synthesized and computationally predicted to have promising physical properties for a variety of electronic and energy technologies. However, the fundamental chemical properties of BL borophene that form the foundation of practical applications remain unexplored. Here, we present atomic&#8208;level chemical characterization of BL borophene using ultrahigh vacuum tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV&#8208;TERS). UHV&#8208;TERS identifies the vibrational fingerprint of BL borophene with angstrom&#8208;scale spatial resolution. The observed Raman spectra are directly correlated with the vibrations of interlayer boron&#8722;boron bonds, validating the three&#8208;dimensional lattice geometry of BL borophene. By virtue of the single&#8208;bond sensitivity of UHV&#8208;TERS to oxygen adatoms, we demonstrate the enhanced chemical stability of BL borophene compared to its monolayer counterpart by exposure to controlled oxidizing atmospheres in UHV. In addition to providing fundamental chemical insight into BL borophene, this work establishes UHV&#8208;TERS as a powerful tool to probe interlayer bonding and surface reactivity of low&#8208;dimensional materials at the atomic scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by Unstabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the first example of palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles. The approach involves initiation by an unstabilized enolate nucleophile under an atmospheric pressure of CO and termination with a carbon electrophile. This process is compatible with a diverse range of electrophiles, including aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl iodides to yield synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products, which were demonstrated to be precursors for multi&#8208;substituted pyridines. A Pd(I)&#8208;dimer complex with two bridging CO units was observed although its role in catalysis is not yet understood</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence for Carbene Intermediates in Isocyanide Homologation by Aluminium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8208;C bond formation between C1 molecules plays an important role in chemistry as manifested by the Fischer&#8208;Tropsch (FT) process. Serving as models for the FT process, we report here the reactions between a neutral Al(I) complex (MeNacNac)Al (1, MeNacNac=HC[(CMe)(NDipp)]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and various isocyanides. The step&#8208;by&#8208;step coupling mechanism was studied in detail by low&#8208;temperature NMR monitoring, isotopic labeling, as well as quantum chemical calculations. Three different products were isolated in reaction of 1 with the sterically encumbered 2,6&#8208;bis(benzhydryl)&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;phenyl isocyanide (BhpNC). These&#160;products substantiate carbene intermediates. The reaction between 1 and adamantyl isocyanide (AdNC) generated a trimerization product, and a corresponding carbene intermediate could be trapped in the form of a molybdenum(0) complex. Tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and even pentamerization products were isolated with the sterically less congested phenyl and p&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides (PhNC and PMPNC) with concurrent construction of quinoline or indole heterocycles. Overall, this study provides evidence for carbene intermediates in FT&#8208;type chemistry of aluminium(I) and isocyanides.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyethylene Incorporating Diels&#8211;Alder Comonomers: A &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; Strategy for Chemically Recyclable Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization of ethylene with an oxa&#8208;norbornadiene comonomer enabled a thermally&#8208;triggered post&#8208;polymerization retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder method to reveal double bonds in the polyethylene backbone. The spacing of the backbone unsaturation was tuned and the double bonds served as sites at which further functionalization was performed.







Abstract
Polyolefins with periodic unsaturation in the backbone chain are sought after for synthesizing chemically recyclable polymers or telechelic polyolefin macromonomers. Here we introduce a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of unsaturated high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) via copolymerization of ethylene with dimethyl 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate followed by post&#8208;polymerization retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder to unveil hidden double bonds in the polymer backbone. The incorporation of this &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; comonomer was varied and a series of unsaturated HDPE polymers with block lengths of 1.2, 1.9, and 3.5&#8197;kDa between double bonds was synthesized. Cross metathesis of unsaturated HDPE samples with 2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate yielded telechelic ester terminated PE macromonomers suitable for the preparation of ester&#8208;linked PE. These materials were depolymerized and repolymerized, making them suitable candidates for chemical recycling. The ester&#8208;linked PE displayed thermal and mechanical properties comparable to commercial HDPE.

         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is significant to overcome challenges like fossil fuel depletion and carbon dioxide emission, but its efficiency is still far below commercialization need. Herein we achieve long&#8208;term stable H2 bubbling production from water (H2O) and lactic acid via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis in a porous microreactor (PP12) benefit for photocatalyst dispersion, charge separation, mass transfer and dissociation of O&#8208;H bonds of H2O. With the widely used platinum/cadmium&#8208;sulfide (Pt/CdS) as photocatalyst, PP12 leads to a H2 bubbling production rate of 602.5 mmol h&#8208;1 m&#8208;2, which is 1000 times higher than that in traditional reactor. Even when amplifying PP12 into a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1 m2 and elongating reaction time to 100 h, H2 bubbling production rate still remains at around 600.0 mmol h&#8208;1 m&#8208;2, offering a great potential for commercialization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The brain&#8208;storm of designing low&#8208;cost and commercialized eutectic electrolytes for zinc (Zn)&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage (ZEES) remains unresolved and attractive, especially when implementing it at low temperatures. Here, we report an appealing layout of advancing chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic (Cl&#8208;FE) electrolytes via exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with Zn acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and is prone to constitute Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes with a unique inner/outer eutectic solvation sheath for the better regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating neighboring and reconstruction of H&#8208;bonding. The side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% can be achieved over 1000 cycles at &#8208;20 &#176;C with Zn//Cu setups. By prototyping scale&#8208;up Zn&#8208;ion pouch cells using the optimal eutectic liquid of 3ZnOAc1.2Cl1.8&#8208;DOL, we obtain improved electrochemical properties at &#8722;20 &#176;C with a high capacitance of 203.9 F g&#8210;1 at 0.02 A g&#8210;1 in a range of 0.20&#8208;1.90 V and long&#8208;term cycling ability with 95.3% capacitance retention at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 over 3,000 cycles. Overall, the proposal of ideal Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes guides the design of sub&#8208;zero and endurable aqueous ZEES devices and beyond.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A general approach to 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by reduction of spirocyclic oxetanyl nitriles was developed. The mechanism, scope, and scalability of this transformation were studied. The core was incorporated into the structure of the antihistamine drug Rupatidine instead of the pyridine ring, which led to a dramatic improvement in physicochemical properties.

         <title>Magnesium(I) Reduction of Aluminum(III) Hydride Complexes: Generation of Mixed Valence Aluminum (AlI/Al0) Hydride Cluster Compounds, [Al6H8(NR3)2{Mg(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate)}4]

Reductions of simple amido&#8208; and aryloxy&#8722;aluminum dihydride complexes with dimagnesium(I) reagents have afforded deep red mixed&#8208;valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66 (see picture). These clusters extend the limited parallels that exist between the chemistry of aluminum hydrides and polyhedral boranes.







Abstract
Reduction of a range of amido&#8208; and aryloxy&#8208;aluminum dihydride complexes, e.g. [AlH2(NR3){N(SiMe3)2}] (NR3=NMe3 or N&#8208;methylpiperidine (NMP)), with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) reagents, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8722;, Ar=mesityl (Mes) or 2,6&#8208;xylyl (Xyl)), have afforded deep red mixed valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, [Al6H8(NR3)2{Mg(ArNacnac)}4], which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66, the lowest for any well&#8208;defined aluminum hydride compound. In the solid&#8208;state, the clusters are shown to have distorted octahedral Al6 cores, having zero&#8208;valent Al axial sites and mono&#8208;valent AlH2&#8722; equatorial units. Several novel by&#8208;products were isolated from the reactions that gave the clusters, including the Mg&#8722;Al bonded magnesio&#8208;aluminate complexes, [(ArNacnac)(Me3N)Mg&#8722;Al(&#956;&#8208;H)3[{Mg(ArNacnac)}2(&#956;&#8208;H)]]. Computational analyses of one aluminum hydride cluster revealed its Al6 core to be electronically delocalized, and to possess one unoccupied, and six occupied, skeletal molecular orbitals.

         <title>Illustrating the Fate of Methyl Radical in Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fleeting intermediates such as methyl radical (&#8901;CH3), methoxy radical and formaldehyde, were captured during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry, which sheds light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has emerged as an ideal method for the direct activation and conversion of methane under mild conditions. In this reaction, methyl radical (&#8901;CH3) was deemed a key intermediate that affected the yields and selectivity of the products. However, direct observation of &#8901;CH3 and other intermediates is still challenging. Here, a rectangular photocatalytic reactor coupled with in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS) was developed to detect reactive intermediates within several hundred microseconds during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO. Gas phase &#8901;CH3 generated by photogenerated holes (O&#8722;) was directly observed, and its formation was demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Methoxy radical (CH3O&#8901;) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were confirmed to be key C1 intermediates in photocatalytic methane overoxidation to CO2. The gas&#8208;phase self&#8208;coupling reaction of &#8901;CH3 contributes to the formation of ethane, which indicates the key role of &#8901;CH3 desorption in the highly selective synthesis of ethane. Based on the observed intermediates, the reaction network initiated from &#8901;CH3 of photocatalytic methane oxidation could be clearly illustrated, which is helpful for studying the photocatalytic methane conversion processes.

         <title>Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl Difluoride (EDSF) for SuFEx Click Chemistry: Synthesis of SuFExable 1,1&#8208;Bissulfonylfluoride Substituted Cyclobutene Hubs</title>

         <dc:description>
Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF) represents a novel SuFEx connector hub. Here, we demonstrate the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of EDSF with aryl acetylenes, which rapidly and regioselectively generates unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes. Moreover, these products can selectively undergo SuFEx reactions with phenols, highlighting their potential for constructing complex molecular architectures.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;bis(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, a bench&#8208;stable precursor to ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF). The novel SuFEx reagent, EDSF, is demonstrated in the preparation of 26 unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes via a cycloaddition reaction. The regioselective click cycloaddition reaction is rapid, straightforward, and highly efficient, enabling the generation of highly functionalized 4&#8208;membered ring (4MR) carbocycles. These carbocycles are valuable structural motifs found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules. Additionally, we showcase diversification of the novel cyclobutene cores through selective Cs2CO3&#8208;activated SuFEx click chemistry between a single S&#8722;F group and an aryl alcohol, yielding the corresponding sulfonate ester products with high efficiency. Finally, density functional theory calculations offer mechanistic insights about the reaction pathway.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformations: Stepwise CO2 Insertions into Bridging Hydrides of [(NHC)CuH]2 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) reactions of gaseous CO2 and solid [(NHC)CuH]2 dimers enabled the isolation of unusual dicopper formate species that are inaccessible by conventional solution reactions of CO2.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies of substrate insertion into dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes with two bridging hydrides have been shown to require dimer dissociation to generate transient, highly reactive (NHC)Cu&#8722;H monomers in solution. Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformations, we discovered a new pathway of stepwise insertion of CO2 into [(NHC)CuH]2 without complete dissociation of the dimer. The first CO2 insertion into dimeric [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (IPr*OMe=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;phenyl)imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) produced a dicopper formate hydride [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(&#956;&#8208;H). A second CO2 insertion produced a dicopper bis(formate), [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(&#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;O2CH), containing two different bonding modes of the bridging formate. These dicopper formate complexes are inaccessible from solution reactions since the dicopper core cleanly ruptures to monomeric complexes when dissolved in a solvent.

         <title>Intermediate Formation of Macrocycles for Efficient Crystallization of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient crystallization strategy is proposed for 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) involving intermediate formation of hexagonal macrocycles. COF&#8208;935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting when exposed to visible light. Even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, COF&#8208;935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained significant attention as key photocatalysts for efficient solar light conversion into hydrogen production. Unfortunately, the harsh synthetic conditions and intricate growth process required to obtain highly crystalline COFs greatly hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a simple strategy for the efficient crystallization of 2D COFs based on the intermediate formation of hexagonal macrocycles. Mechanistic investigation suggests that the use of 2,4,6&#8208;triformyl resorcinol (TFR) as the asymmetrical aldehyde build block allows the equilibration between irreversible enol&#8208;to&#8208;keto tautomerization and dynamic imine bonds to produce the hexagonal &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked macrocycles, the formation of which could provide COFs with high crystallinity in half hour. We show that COF&#8208;935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt as cocatalyst exhibit a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting when exposed to visible light. More importantly, COF&#8208;935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, which is a significant breakthrough in this field. This strategy would provide valuable insights into the design of highly crystalline COFs as efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Styrenes by Platinum&#8208; Catalyzed Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydrosilylation of unactivated internal alkynes has been developed. Various styrene&#8208;type atropisomers with open&#8208;chained olefins were obtained with high stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Hydrofunctionalization of alkynes is one of the most efficient ways to access axially chiral styrenes with open&#8208;chained olefins. While great advances have been achieved for 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and analogues, atroposelective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated internal alkynes lags. Herein we reported a platinum&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydrosilylation of unactivated internal alkynes for the first time. With monodentate TADDOL&#8208;derived phosphonite L1 used as a chiral ligand, various axially chiral styrenes were achieved in excellent enantioselectivities with high E&#8208;selectivities. Control experiments showed that the NH&#8208;arylamide groups have significant effects on both the yields and enantioselectivities and could act as directing groups. The potential utilities of the products were shown by the transformations of the amide motifs of the products.

         <title>Selective Terminal Functionalization of Linear Alkanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step sequential strategy, involving a biocatalytic dehydrogenation/remote hydrofunctionalization as a unified and versatile approach to selectively convert linear alkanes into a large array of valuable functionalized aliphatic derivatives is reported. The reaction goes through a site&#8208;selective functionalization at the unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds of the linear alkane and avoids the use of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step sequential strategy involving a biocatalytic dehydrogenation/remote hydrofunctionalization, as a unified and versatile approach to selectively convert linear alkanes into a large array of valuable functionalized aliphatic derivatives is reported. The dehydrogenation is carried out by a mutant strain of a bacteria Rhodococcus and the produced alkenes are subsequently engaged in a remote functionalization through a metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrometalation/migration sequence that subsequently react with a large variety of electrophiles. The judicious implementation of this combined biocatalytic and organometallic approach enabled us to develop a high&#8208;yielding protocol to site&#8208;selectively functionalize unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds.

The judicious implementation of this combined biocatalytic and organometallic approach enabled us to develop a high-yielding protocol to site-selectively functionalize unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Imine Condensation Chemistry with [3,3] Diaza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement for One&#8208;Step Formation of Hydrolytically Stable Chiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral hydrolytically stable cages have been prepared by a strategy that combines the advantages of a thermodynamic driven (dynamic covalent chemistry) formation of a supramolecular structure using imine chemistry together with a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. This approach of &#8220;freezing the dynamics&#8221; has been demonstrated with chiral tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine &#8208;based systems, which are hydrolytically stable due to the by the formation of C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has, in recent years, provided valuable tools to synthesize molecular architectures of increasing complexity. We have also taken advantage of imine DCC chemistry to prepare TPMA&#8208;based supramolecular cages for molecular recognition applications. However, the versatility of this approach has as a major drawback the intrinsic hydrolytic lability of imines, which hampers some applications. We present herein a synthetic strategy that combines the advantages of a thermodynamic&#8208;driven formation of a supramolecular structure using imine chemistry, together with the possibility to synthetize chiral hydrolytically stable structures through a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A preliminary mechanistic analysis of this one&#8208;pot synthesis and the scope of the reaction are also discussed.

         <title>Increased Nitrogenase Activity in Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrids Containing Non&#8208;photosynthetic Bacteria and Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic conjugated poly(fluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;phenylene) derivative (PFP) and non&#8208;photosynthetic nitrogen&#8208;fixing Azotobacter Chroococcum (A.&#8197;Chroococcum) were first combined to create a new light&#8208;driven and self&#8208;assembled biohybrid system. PFP possesses excellent light harvesting ability and transfers electrons into redox proteins in A.&#8197;Chroococcum, promoting the nitrogen fixation pathway in situ under illumination.







Abstract
A conductive polymer&#8208;based photosynthetic biohybrid is constructed to enhance biological nitrogen fixation by increasing nitrogenase activity in the non&#8208;photosynthetic bacterium Azotobacter Chroococcum (A.&#8197;Chroococcum). The light&#8208;harvesting cationic poly(fluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) electrostatically binds to the surface of the bacteria and possesses satisfactory conductivity to facilitate electron transfer to the bacterium, promoting the nitrogen fixation pathway through redox proteins on the surface of the bacteria when under illumination. Therefore, the nitrogenase activity, hydrogen, NH4+&#8208;N and L&#8208;amino acids production are increased by 260&#8201;%, 37&#8201;%, 44&#8201;%, and 47&#8201;%, respectively. The expression levels of nifD and nifK encoding molybdenum&#8208;iron (MoFe) protein and relevant nitrogen&#8208;fixing proteins are up&#8208;regulated. These photoactive conductive polymer&#8208;bacteria biohybrids provide a new method for improving the biological nitrogen fixation capability of non&#8208;photosynthetic nitrogen&#8208;fixing bacteria.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Doped Nickel Oxide and Nickel Nitride Mediate Selective Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Sterol Intermediates Coupled with H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic system comprised of Cr&#8208;NiO/GF and Cr&#8208;Ni3N/GF (GF: graphite felt) was applied to anodic electrooxidation of sterol and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a high space&#8208;time yield of 48.85&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3&#8201;h&#8722;1 for steroid carbonyl and 1.82&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2 in a two&#8208;layer stacked flow cell. This strategy could facilitate large&#8208;scale simultaneous production of H2 and value&#8208;added pharmaceutical carbonyl intermediates.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organics is considered a promising approach for the simultaneous production of hydrogen (H2) and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, exploring and optimizing efficient electrocatalysts remains a challenge for large&#8208;scale production of value&#8208;added steroid carbonyl and H2. Herein, Cr&#8208;NiO/GF and Cr&#8208;Ni3N/GF (GF: graphite felt) electrocatalysts were designed as anode and cathode for the production of steroid carbonyls and H2, respectively. The cooperative Cr&#8208;NiO and ACT (4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl) electrocatalyst can be extended to the electrooxidation of a series of steroid alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. Additionally, Cr&#8208;Ni3N displays superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a low overpotential of 35&#8197;mV to deliver 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the system coupled with anodic electrooxidation of sterol and cathodic HER exhibited excellent performance with high space&#8208;time yield of 48.85&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3&#8201;h&#8722;1 for steroid carbonyl and 1.82&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2 generation in a two&#8208;layer stacked flow cell. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Cr doping effectively stabilizes ACTH on the NiO surface, and ACTH molecule could be captured via the ketonic oxygen interaction with Cr, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic activity. This work develops a novel approach to the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for the simultaneous production of H2 and large&#8208;scale value&#8208;added pharmaceutical carbonyl intermediates.

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Iron Catalyst with Biomimetic Active Center to Accelerate Proton Spillover for Medical&#8208;level Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Disinfectant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has great potential for directly converting O2 into disinfectant, although it is still a big challenge to develop effective electrocatalysts for medical&#8208;level production. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of electrocatalysts with biomimetic active centers, consisting of single atomic iron asymmetrically coordinated with both nitrogen and sulfur, dispersed on hierarchically porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NS/C). The newly&#8208;developed FeSA&#8208;NS/C catalyst exhibited a high catalytic activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction to produce H2O2 at a high current of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 with a record high H2O2 selectivity of 90% and an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 5.8 wt.% sufficiently high for medical disinfection. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations verified the rationally&#8208;designed catalytic active center with the atomic Fe site stabilized by three&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms and one&#8208;sulfur atom (Fe&#8208;N3S&#8208;C). It was further found that the replacement of one N atom in the classical Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C active center with sulfur atom could induce an asymmetric charge distribution over N atoms surrounding the Fe reactive center to accelerate proton spillover for a rapid formation of the OOH* intermediate, thus speeding up the whole reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction for H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Fe(III)&#8208;initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System in Piezo&#8208;catalytic Process for Organic Pollutants Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;Fenton (PSF) system has been emerging as a promising technique for wastewater treatment, while the competing O2 reductive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and Fe(III) reduction seriously limited the reaction kinetics. Here, we develop a two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production (WOR&#8208;H2O2) coupled with Fe(III) reduction over a Fe(III)/BiOIO3 piezo&#8208;catalyst for highly efficient PSF. It is found that the presence of Fe(III) can simultaneously initiate the WOR&#8208;H2O2 and reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), thereby enabling a rapid reaction kinetics towards subsequent Fenton reaction of H2O2/Fe(II). The Fe(III) initiating PSF system offers exceptional self&#8208;recyclable degradation of pollutants with a degradation rate constant for sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) over 3.5 times as that of the classic Fe(II)&#8208;PSF system. This study offers a new perspective for constructing efficient PSF systems and shatters the preconceived notion of Fe(III) in the Fenton reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Do Corroles Stabilize Tetravalent Antimony?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony corrole cations have been prepared by one&#8208;electron oxidation of antimony(III) congeners with silver(I) and copper(II) salts. Isolation and crystallization was successful for the first time, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic investigation unraveled structural similarities with antimony(III)corroles. EPR experiments showed strong hyperfine interactions of the unpaired electron with the 121Sb (I = 5/2) and 123Sb nuclei (I = 7/2). A DFT analysis supports the description of the oxidized form as a Sb(III) corrole radical with less than 2% Sb(IV) character. In the presence of water or a fluoride source like PF6&#8208;, the compounds undergo a redox disproportionation to yield known antimony(III)corroles and either difluorido&#8208;antimony(V)corroles, or bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxido&#8208;di[antimony(V)corroles] via novel cationic hydroxo&#8208;antimony(V) derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Divergent Polyene Cyclization for the Total Synthesis of Greenwayodendrines, Greenwaylactams, Polysin and Polyveoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a concise (5&#8211;8 steps) asymmetric total synthesis of nine sesquiterpenoid alkaloids featuring four different tetra&#8208;/pentacyclic scaffolds. To this end, a novel, bioinspired indole N&#8208;terminated cationic tricyclization has been developed enabling the divergent syntheses of greenwayodendrines and polysin. Subtle variation of the C2&#8208;substituted indole cyclization precursor allowed switching between indole N&#8208; and C&#8208;termination. For the latter, a subsequent Witkop oxidation enabled conversion of the cyclopentene fused indole to the eight&#8208;membered benzolactam directly furnishing the family of greenwaylactams. In addition, a diastereomeric C&#8208;termination product has been elaborated to provide access to polyveoline.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalytic Platform for the Activation of Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their strong covalent bonds and low reduction potentials, activating inert substrates is challenging. Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered a number of solutions, each of which useful for activating specific inert bonds. Developing a general catalytic platform that can consistently target a broad range of inert substrates would be synthetically useful. Herein, we report a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with 405 nm light, acquires a strongly reducing power. This excited&#8208;state reactivity served to activate, by single&#8208;electron reduction, strong C&#8211;F, C&#8211;Cl, and C&#8211;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich substrates (Ered&lt;&#8211;3.0 V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited&#8208;state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization of Novel Octamolybdate Anions within a Microporous Hybrid Framework with Robust Water Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 3&#8208;D hybrid framework [{Cu(cyclam)}3(&#954;&#8208;Mo8O27)]&#183;14H2O (1) (cyclam = 1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) undergoes sequential single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations upon heating to afford two different anhydrous phases (2a and 3a). These transitions modify the framework dimensionality and enable the isomerization of octamolybdate (Mo8) &#954;&#8208;anions into &#955; (2a) and &#956; (3a) forms through metal migration. Hydration of 3a involves condensation of one water molecule to the cluster to afford the &#947;&#8208;Mo8 isomer in 4, which dehydrates back into 3a through the 6a intermediate. In contrast, 2a reversibly hydrates to form 5, exhibiting the same Mo8 cluster as that of 1. It is remarkable that three of the Mo8 clusters (&#954;, &#955; and &#956;) are new and that up to three different microporous phases can be isolated from 1 (2a, 3a, and 6a). Water vapor sorption analyses show high recyclability and the highest uptake values for POM&#8208;based systems. The isotherms display an abrupt step at low humidity level desirable for humidity control devices or water harvesting in drylands.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Copper 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement: the New Concept Behind the Boryl Migration from C(sp2) in Alkenyl Boranes to C(sp3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;Xantphos system promotes the regioselective borylcupration of borylated skipped (Z)&#8208;dienes generating diborylated alkylcopper species that further induce a stereospecific B/Cu 1,3&#8208;rearrangement through remote B shift from C(sp2) to C(sp3). The boryl migration occurs via a 4&#8208;membered boracycle, followed by an in situ electrophilic trapping allowing C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds formation and alkylidenecyclohexane or &#8208;cyclobutane&#8217; synthesis.







Abstract
Regioselective borylcupration of borylated skipped (Z)&#8208;dienes generates diborylated alkylcopper species that are involved in an intramolecular stereospecific B/Cu 1,3&#8208;rearrangement by migration of Bpin moiety from C(sp2) to C(sp3). DFT mechanistic studies showed that boryl migration occurs through the formation of 4&#8208;membered boracycle intermediate with a moderate free&#8208;energy barrier. Moreover, the use of KOMe forms stable Lewis base adducts with Bpin moieties that blocks the reaction. Subsequently to the 1,3&#8208;boron shift, the in situ electrophilic trapping allows selective C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds, followed by intramolecular cross coupling giving access to cyclic functionalized alkylidenecyclohexanes or alkylidenecyclobutanes.

         <title>Evolutionary Algorithm Directed Synthesis of Mixed Anion Compounds LaF2X (X=Br, I) and LaFI2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the evolutionary algorithm directed synthesis of mixed&#8208;anion compounds with LaF2X and LaFX2 (X=Br, I). The new structures share the structural features of the end phases LaF3 and LaI3, but with heteroleptic coordination environments around La, which could be beneficial for fluoride ion conductivity as shown theoretically.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion compounds have attracted growing attentions, but their synthesis is challenging, making a rational search desirable. Here, we explored LaF3&#8208;LaX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) system using ab initio structure searches based on evolutionary algorithms, and predicted LaF2X and LaFX2 (X=Br, I), which are respectively isostructural with LaHBr2 and YH2I, consisting of layered La&#8208;F blocks with single and double ordered honeycomb lattices, separated by van der Waals gaps. We successfully synthesized these compounds: LaF2Br and LaFI2 crystallize in the predicted structure, while LaF2I is similar to the predicted one but with different layer stacking. LaF2I exhibits fluoride ion conductivity comparable to that of non&#8208;doped LaF3, and has the potential to show better ionic conductivity upon appropriate doping, given the theoretically lower diffusion energy barrier and the presence of soft iodine anions. This study shows the structure prediction using evolutionary algorithms will accelerate the discovery of mixed&#8208;anion compounds in future, in particular those with an ordered anion arrangement.

         <title>Unlocking Migratory Insertion in Gold Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle has been reported. It represents an important progress within the field of gold redox couple chemistry and in particular in the migratory insertion topic.







Abstract
Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into AuIII&#8208;carbon bonds in the AuI/AuIII redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.

         <title>Introducing Water and Deep Eutectic Solvents in Organosodium Chemistry: Chemoselective Nucleophilic Functionalizations in Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosodium compounds, generated by the oxidative addition of a C&#8722;Cl bond to Na, a halogen/Na exchange, or by direct sodiation using Na bricks or neopentylsodium in hexane, have been intercepted by various electrophiles, when working &#8220;on water&#8221; or in eutectic mixtures. These reactions display a broad substrate scope, under hydrous conditions at room temperature, short reaction times (20&#8197;s), high chemoselectivity, and they are also scalable.







Abstract
Advancing the development of perfecting the use of polar organometallics in bio&#8208;inspired solvents, we report on the effective generation in batch of organosodium compounds, by the oxidative addition of a C&#8722;Cl bond to sodium, a halogen/sodium exchange, or by direct sodiation, when using sodium bricks or neopentylsodium in hexane as sodium sources. C(sp3)&#8208;, C(sp2)&#8208;, and C(sp)&#8208;hybridized alkyl and (hetero)aryl sodiated species have been chemoselectively trapped (in competition with protonolysis), with a variety of electrophiles when working &#8220;on water&#8221;, or in biodegradable choline chloride/urea or L&#8208;proline/glycerol eutectic mixtures, under hydrous conditions and at room temperature. Additional benefits include a very short reaction time (20&#8197;s), a wide substrate scope, and good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) of the desired adducts. The practicality of the proposed protocol was demonstrated by setting up a sodium&#8208;mediated multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the anticholinergic drug orphenadrine.

         <title>Resolving the Heat Generated from ZrO2 Atomic Layer Deposition Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ pyroelectric calorimetry was used to investigate the saturating surface reactions for tetrakis(dimethylamino)zirconium(IV) (TDMAZr) and water. Time&#8208;resolved measurements of heat generation provide both kinetic and thermodynamic information. These results were compared to calculated enthalpies from DFT models to better understand proposed mechanisms for these atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactions.







Abstract
In situ pyroelectric calorimetry and spectroscopic ellipsometry were used to investigate surface reactions in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium oxide (ZrO2). Calibrated and time&#8208;resolved in situ ALD calorimetry provides new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of saturating surface reactions for tetrakis(dimethylamino)zirconium(IV) (TDMAZr) and water. The net ALD reaction heat ranged from 0.197&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 76&#8201;&#176;C to 0.155&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 158&#8201;&#176;C, corresponding to an average of 4.0&#8197;eV/Zr at all temperatures. A temperature dependence for reaction kinetics was not resolved over the range investigated. The temperature dependence of net reaction heat and distribution among metalorganic and oxygen source exposure is attributed to factors including growth rate, equilibrium surface hydroxylation, and the extent of the reaction. ZrO2&#8208;forming surface reactions were investigated computationally using DFT methods to better understand the influence of surface hydration on reaction thermodynamics.

         <title>Trinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation of styrenes with unactivated alkyl bromides has been developed using a trinuclear gold&#8208;catalyst. This protocol exhibits a broad reaction scope and excellent functional group compatibility (&gt;100&#8197;examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield). It also affords a robust formal [2+2+1] cyclization strategy for the concise construction of tetrahydropyrrole skeleton.







Abstract
Activated alkyl halides have been extensively explored to generate alkyl radicals with Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208; photocatalysts for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, but unactivated alkyl bromides remain challenging substrates due to their strong reduction potential. Here we report a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction of alkenes, unactivated alkyl bromides and nucleophiles (e.g., amines and indoles) using a trinuclear gold catalyst [Au3(tppm)2](OTf)3. It can achieve the 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation readily. This protocol has a broad reaction scope and excellent functional group compatibility (&gt;100&#8197;examples with up to 96&#8201;% yield). It also affords a robust formal [2+2+1] cyclization strategy for the concise construction of pyrrolidine skeletons under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support an inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer pathway for the successful cleavage of inert C&#8722;Br bonds.

         <title>Discrimination of the Enantiotopic Faces of Structurally Unbiased Carbenium Ions Employing a Cyclohexadiene&#8208;Based Chiral Hydride Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclohexadiene&#8208;based dihydrogen surrogate can distinguish between the enantiotopic faces of benzylic carbenium ions (see Scheme). No covalent interactions are required but instead dispersion controls the facial discrimination as verified by computations.







Abstract
An enantioselective reduction of simple carbenium ions with cyclohexadienes containing a hydridic C&#8722;H bond at an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is disclosed. The net reaction is a transfer hydrogenation of alkenes (styrenes) only employing chiral cyclohexadienes as dihydrogen surrogates. The trityl cation is used to initiate a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted process, in which a delicate intermolecular capture of a carbenium&#8208;ion intermediate by the aforementioned chiral hydride source is enantioselectivity determining. Exclusively non&#8208;covalent interactions are rendering one of the transition states energetically more favored, giving the reduction products in good enantiomeric ratios. The computed reaction mechanism supports the present findings as well as previous results obtained from studies on other transfer&#8208;hydrogenation methods involving the cyclohexadiene platform.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Amine Cascade Addition to Diyne&#8208;Ene: Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion utilizing gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular amine cascade addition to diyne&#8208;ene is reported herein, exhibiting good yield and excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
With the well&#8208;documented chemical and biological applications, piperidine and pyridine are among the most important N&#8208;heterocycles, and a new synthetic strategy, especially one with an alternative bond&#8208;forming design, is of general interest. Using the gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular condensation of amine and diyne&#8208;ene, we report herein the first example of enantioselective 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion (up to 95&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;e.e.).

         <dc:description>Asymmetric cross&#8208;couplings based on 1,2&#8208;carbon migration from B&#8208;ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2&#8208;boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2&#8208;boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature.

         <title>Reprocessible triketoenamine based vitrimers with closed&#8208;loop recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of thermosets that can be repeatedly recycled via both chemical route (closed&#8208;loop) and thermo&#8208;mechanical process is attractive and remains an imperative task. In this work, we reported a triketoenamine based dynamic covalent network derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and secondary amines. The resulting triketoenamine based network does not have intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thus reducing its &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, lowering the stability of the tautomer structure, and enabling its dynamic feature. By virtue of the highly reversible bond exchange, this novel dynamic covalent bond enables the easy construction of highly crosslinked and chemically reprocessable networks from commercially available monomers. The as&#8208;made polymer monoliths exhibit high mechanical properties (tensile strength of 79.4 MPa and Young&#8217;s modulus of 571.4 MPa) and can undergo a monomer&#8208;network&#8208;monomer (yields up to 90%) recycling mediated by an aqueous solution, with the new&#8208;generation polymer capable of restoring the material strength to its original state. In addition, owing to its dynamic nature, a catalyst&#8208;free and low&#8208;temperature reprogrammable covalent adaptable network (vitrimer) was achieved. The design concept reported herein can be applied to the development of other novel vitrimers with high repressibility and recyclability, and sheds light on future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Cathode by sp&#8208;Carbon Induced Conversion in Multi&#8208;Level Structure of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;level architecture alternatively formed by the conformal graphdiyne (GDY) and CuS is well engineered for Li&#8208;free cathode. Such a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept architecture efficiently integrates the advantages of GDY and produces new functional heterojunctions (sp&#8208;C&#8208;S&#8208;Cu hybridization bond). The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer 2D confinement effect successfully avoids structural collapse, the selective transport greatly inhibits the shuttling of active components, and the interfacial sp&#8208;C&#8208;S&#8208;Cu hybridization bond significantly regulates the phase conversion reaction. Such new sp&#8208;C&#8208;S&#8208;Cu hybridization of GDY greatly improves the reaction dynamics and reversibility, and the cathode delivers an energy density up to 934 Wh kg&#8208;1 and an unattenuated lifespan of 1200 cycles at high rate. Our results indicate that the success of the GDY&#8208;based interface strategy will greatly promote the efficient utilization of the conversion&#8208;type cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Power of Kinetic Inertness in Improving Platinum Anticancer Therapy by Circumventing Resistance and Ameliorating Nephrotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even in the modern era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, chemotherapy with platinum (Pt) drugs remain among the most commonly prescribed medication against a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, the broad applicability of these blockbuster Pt drugs is severely limited by intrinsic and/or acquired resistance, and high systemic toxicity. Considering the strong inter&#8208;connection between kinetic lability and undesired shortcomings of clinical Pt drugs, we rationally designed kinetically inert organometallic Pt based anticancer agents with a novel mechanism of action. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays we demonstrated that the development of a remarkably efficacious but kinetically inert Pt anticancer agent is feasible. Along with exerting promising antitumor efficacy in Pt&#8208;sensitive as well as Pt&#8208;resistant tumors in vivo, our best candidate has the ability to mitigate the nephrotoxicity issue associated with cisplatin. In addition to demonstrating, for the first time, the power of kinetic inertness on improving the therapeutic benefits of Pt based anticancer therapy, we described the detailed mechanism of action of our best kinetically inert antitumor agent. This study will certainly pave the way for designing next generation of anticancer drugs for effective treatment of various cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mucin&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Chain Polymer (MIP) Fibers as Potent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological mucus, here, we report multi gram&#8208;scale synthesis of dendronized polysulfates as mucin&#8208;inspired virus&#8208;binding polymer (MIPs). Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis reveals their single chain fiber morphology. These biocompatible synthesized fibers inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and inhibitory activities depend on the length of the fibers.







Abstract
Mucins are the key component of the defensive mucus barrier. They are extended fibers of very high molecular weight with diverse biological functions depending strongly on their specific structural parameters. Here, we present a mucin&#8208;inspired nanostructure, produced via a synthetic methodology to prepare methacrylate&#8208;based dendronized polysulfates (MIP&#8208;1) on a multi gram&#8208;scale with high molecular weight (MW=450&#8197;kDa) and thiol end&#8208;functionalized mucin&#8208;inspired polymer (MIP) via RAFT polymerization. Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis of MIP&#8208;1 confirmed a mucin&#8208;mimetic wormlike single&#8208;chain fiber structure (length=144&#177;59&#8197;nm) in aqueous solution. This biocompatible fiber showed promising activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its mutant strain, with a remarkable low half maximal (IC50) inhibitory concentration (IC50=10.0&#8197;nM). Additionally, we investigate the impact of fiber length on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 inhibition by testing other functional polymers (MIPs) of varying fiber lengths.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyethyleneimines from the Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the synthesis of polyethyleneimines is reported based on manganese catalysed coupling of ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine. This avoids the use of the highly toxic feedstock, namely aziridine, that is currently used for the production of this polymer.







Abstract
Polyethyleneimines find many applications in products such as detergents, adhesives, cosmetics, and for processes such as tissue culture, gene therapy, and CO2 capture. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for the production of the branched polyethyleneimines involves aziridine feedstock which is a highly toxic, volatile and mutagenic chemical and raises significant concern to human health and environment. We report here a novel method for the synthesis of branched polyethyleneimine derivative from ethylene glycol and ethylenediamine which are much safer, environmentally benign, commercially available and potentially renewable feedstock. The polymerisation reaction is catalysed by a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant metal, manganese and liberates H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Our mechanistic studies using a combination of DFT computation and experiment suggest that the reaction proceeds by the formation and subsequent hydrogenation of imine intermediates.

         <title>Bi&#8208;affinity Electrolyte Optimizing High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese Oxide Battery via Interface Modulation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of an interface modulation strategy has led to the successful development of a high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;rich manganese oxide battery. The optimized dual&#8208;additive electrolyte formulation demonstrated remarkable bi&#8208;affinity and could facilitate the formation of robust interphases on both the anode and cathode simultaneously.







Abstract
The practical implementation of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;rich manganese oxide (LRMO) cathode is limited by the unanticipated electrolyte decomposition and dissolution of transition metal ions. The present study proposes a bi&#8208;affinity electrolyte formulation, wherein the sulfonyl group of ethyl vinyl sulfone (EVS) imparts a highly adsorptive nature to LRMO, while fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits a reductive nature towards Li metal. This interface modulation strategy involves the synergistic use of EVS and FEC as additives to form robust interphase layers on the electrode. As&#8208;formed S&#8208;endorsed but LiF&#8208;assisted configuration cathode electrolyte interphase with a more dominant &#8722;SO2&#8722; component may promote the interface transport kinetics and prevent the dissolution of transition metal ions. Furthermore, the incorporation of S component into the solid electrolyte interphase and the reduction of its poorly conducting component can effectively inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. Therefore, a 4.8&#8197;V LRMO/Li cell with optimized electrolyte may demonstrate a remarkable retention capacity of 97&#8201;% even after undergoing 300&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.

     alt="Bi-affinity Electrolyte Optimizing High-Voltage Lithium-Rich Manganese Oxide Battery via Interface Modulation Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of an interface modulation strategy has led to the successful development of a high-voltage lithium-rich manganese oxide battery. The optimized dual-additive electrolyte formulation demonstrated remarkable bi-affinity and could facilitate the formation of robust interphases on both the anode and cathode simultaneously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical implementation of high-voltage lithium-rich manganese oxide (LRMO) cathode is limited by the unanticipated electrolyte decomposition and dissolution of transition metal ions. The present study proposes a bi-affinity electrolyte formulation, wherein the sulfonyl group of ethyl vinyl sulfone (EVS) imparts a highly adsorptive nature to LRMO, while fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits a reductive nature towards Li metal. This interface modulation strategy involves the synergistic use of EVS and FEC as additives to form robust interphase layers on the electrode. As-formed S-endorsed but LiF-assisted configuration cathode electrolyte interphase with a more dominant &#8722;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; component may promote the interface transport kinetics and prevent the dissolution of transition metal ions. Furthermore, the incorporation of S component into the solid electrolyte interphase and the reduction of its poorly conducting component can effectively inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. Therefore, a 4.8&#8197;V LRMO/Li cell with optimized electrolyte may demonstrate a remarkable retention capacity of 97&#8201;% even after undergoing 300&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Co4 Atomic Clusters to Enable Fe&#8722;N4 Motifs with Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing metal atomic clusters can effectively boost the oxygen evolution reaction (ORR) performance and stability of Fe&#8722;N4 on the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) substrate. The Co4@/Fe1@NC catalyst is realized through a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained&#8221; strategy using Co4 molecular clusters and Fe(acac)3 implanted carbon precursors and the obtained catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N4 configurations are highly needed owing to the high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the limited intrinsic activity and dissatisfactory durability have significantly restrained the practical application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Here, we demonstrate that constructing adjacent metal atomic clusters (ACs) is effective in boosting the ORR performance and stability of Fe&#8722;N4 catalysts. The integration of Fe&#8722;N4 configurations with highly uniform Co4 ACs on the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Co4@/Fe1@NC) is realized through a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained&#8221; strategy using Co4 molecular clusters and Fe(acac)3 implanted carbon precursors. The as&#8208;developed Co4@/Fe1@NC catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.835&#8197;V vs. RHE in acidic media and a high peak power density of 840&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell test. First&#8208;principles calculations further clarify the ORR catalytic mechanism on the identified Fe&#8722;N4 that modified with Co4 ACs. This work provides a viable strategy for precisely establishing atomically dispersed polymetallic centers catalysts for efficient energy&#8208;related catalysis.

         <title>A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Activation of Environment&#8208;Sensitive Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concerted strategy involving enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly to target overexpressed alkaline phosphatases in cancer cells and bioorthogonal reactions for controllable extracellular and intracellular activation of RuII&#8208;based imaging probes and photosensitizers is presented. The emission enhancement, lifetime extension, and (photo)cytotoxicity of the resulting RuII supramolecular assemblies were explored extracellularly and intracellularly.







Abstract
In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal&#8208;based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment&#8208;sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.

         <title>Efficient Conversion of Biomass to Formic Acid Coupled with Low Energy Consumption Hydrogen Production from Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolysis system was constructed by using polyoxometalates (POMs) as redox medium, which realized efficient conversion of biomass to formic acid (FA) coupling with a low&#8208;cost hydrogen production.







Abstract
The development of a new electrolytic water hydrogen production coupling system is the key to realize efficient and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production and promote its practical application. Herein, a green and efficient electrocatalytic biomass to formic acid (FA) coupled hydrogen production system has been developed. In such a system, carbohydrates such as glucose are oxidized to FA using polyoxometalates (POMs) as the redox anolyte, while H2 is evolved continuously at the cathode. Among them, the yield of glucose to FA is as high as 62.5&#8201;%, and FA is the only liquid product. Furthermore, the system requires only 1.22&#8197;V to drive a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Faraday efficiency of hydrogen production is close to 100&#8201;%. Its electrical consumption is only 2.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3 (H2), which is only 69&#8201;% of that of traditional electrolytic water. This work opens up a promising direction for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production coupled with efficient biomass conversion.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of 3&#8208;Substituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzophenone&#8208;based catalyst was used as the only source of chirality in the photochemical deracemization of 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles. The reaction likely proceeds by hydrogen atom transfer and delivers the desired products, and derivatives thereof, with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Racemic 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles were successfully converted into enantiomerically pure or enriched material (up to 99&#8201;% ee) upon irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral benzophenone catalyst (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The photochemical deracemization process allows predictable editing of the stereogenic center at carbon atom C3. Light energy compensates for the associated loss of entropy and enables the decoupling of potentially reversible reactions, i.e. a hydrogen atom transfer to (photochemical) and from (thermal) the carbonyl group of the catalyst. The major enantiomer is continuously enriched in several catalytic cycles. The obtained oxindoles were shown to be valuable intermediates for further transformations, which proceeded with complete retention at the stereogenic center.

         <title>Crystal Structure and NMR of an &#945;,&#948;&#8208;Peptide Foldamer Helix Shows Side&#8208;Chains are Well Placed for Bifunctional Catalysis: Application as a Minimalist Aldolase Mimic
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic foldamer constructed of &#945;&#8208; and bespoke &#948;&#8208;residues forms a helix which is not only stabilized by intramolecular H&#8208;bonds, but also by apolar interactions not observed in foldamer secondary structures until now. The resulting scaffold gives a useful juxtaposition of functionality and leads to bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated through an aldolase&#8208;like process.







Abstract
We report the first NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) structures of an unusual 13/11&#8208;helix (alternating i,&#8201;i+1 {NH&#8722;O=C} and i,&#8201;i+3 {C=O&#8722;H&#8722;N} H&#8208;bonds) formed by a heteromeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 sequence of &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;amino acids, and demonstrate the application of this framework towards catalysis. Whilst intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) are the clear driver of helix formation in this system, we also observe an apolar interaction between the ethyl residue of one &#948;&#8208;amino acid and the cyclohexyl group of the next &#948;&#8208;residue in the sequence that seems to stabilize one type of helix over another. To the best of our knowledge this type of additional stabilization leading to a specific helical preference has not been observed before. Critically, the helix type realized places the &#945;&#8208;residue functionalities in positions proximal enough to engage in bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated in the application of our system as a minimalist aldolase mimic.

&lt;p&gt;A new catalytic foldamer constructed of &#945;- and bespoke &#948;-residues forms a helix which is not only stabilized by intramolecular H-bonds, but also by apolar interactions not observed in foldamer secondary structures until now. The resulting scaffold gives a useful juxtaposition of functionality and leads to bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated through an aldolase-like process.

         <title>Stochastic Simulation of Controlled Radical Polymerization Forming Dendritic Hyperbranched Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The results suggest that the observed dispersities (&#272;=1.5&#8211;2) originated from the distribution of branch numbers and that the branch structures are well controlled. Furthermore, the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one.







Abstract
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (&#272;s) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed &#272;s (=1.5&#8211;2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.

         <title>Unveiling the CO Oxidation Mechanism over a Molecularly Defined Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic CO oxidation is described over a structurally well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom catalyst with isolated Cu ions supported on a UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework with missing linkers. The reaction pathway, intermediates and transition states were elucidated. A number of different experimental and calculated catalyst properties were compared at the different stages of the reaction.







Abstract
Elucidating the reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis is critically important for catalyst development, yet remains challenging because of the often unclear nature of the active sites. Using a molecularly defined copper single&#8208;atom catalyst supported by a UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu/UiO&#8208;66) allows a detailed mechanistic elucidation of the CO oxidation reaction. Based on a combination of in situ/operando spectroscopies, kinetic measurements including kinetic isotope effects, and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory&#8208;based calculations, we identified the active site, reaction intermediates, and transition states of the dominant reaction cycle as well as the changes in oxidation/spin state during reaction. The reaction involves the continuous reactive dissociation of adsorbed O2, by reaction of O2,ad with COad, leading to the formation of an O atom connecting the Cu center with a neighboring Zr4+ ion as the rate limiting step. This is removed in a second activated step.

         <title>Direct Insertion Polymerization of Ionic Monomers: Rapid Production of Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a direct coordination&#8208;insertion polymerization of cation&#8208;containing monomers, allowing facile access to a broad range of materials. Demonstrating the utility of this method, we produced a diverse library of ionic polymers for use as anion exchange membranes and investigated the influence of cation identity on hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability.







Abstract
The limited number of methods to directly polymerize ionic monomers currently hinders rapid diversification and production of ionic polymeric materials, namely anion exchange membranes (AEMs) which are essential components in emerging alkaline fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies. Herein, we report a direct coordination&#8208;insertion polymerization of cationic monomers, providing the first direct synthesis of aliphatic polymers with high ion incorporations and allowing facile access to a broad range of materials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by rapidly generating a library of solution processable ionic polymers for use as AEMs. We investigate these materials to study the influence of cation identity on hydroxide conductivity and stability. We found that AEMs with piperidinium cations exhibited the highest performance, with high alkaline stability, hydroxide conductivity of 87&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and a peak power density of 730&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 when integrated into a fuel cell device.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion via Optimized Photothermal Catalysis in a Lotus Pod Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potassium&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported cobalt catalyst mimicking the structure of a lotus pod is developed. With hierarchical pores, intimate Co/C interfaces, and exposed catalytic sites, the catalyst shows a record&#8208;high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation rate with near&#8208;unity selectivity for CO.







Abstract
Photothermal CO2 reduction is one of the most promising routes to efficiently utilize solar energy for fuel production at high rates. However, this reaction is currently limited by underdeveloped catalysts with low photothermal conversion efficiency, insufficient exposure of active sites, low active material loading, and high material cost. Herein, we report a potassium&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported cobalt (K+&#8722;Co&#8722;C) catalyst mimicking the structure of a lotus pod that addresses these challenges. As a result of the designed lotus&#8208;pod structure which features an efficient photothermal C substrate with hierarchical pores, an intimate Co/C interface with covalent bonding, and exposed Co catalytic sites with optimized CO binding strength, the K+&#8722;Co&#8722;C catalyst shows a record&#8208;high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation rate of 758&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (2871&#8197;mmol&#8201;gCo&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with a 99.8&#8201;% selectivity for CO, three orders of magnitude higher than typical photochemical CO2 reduction reactions. We further demonstrate with this catalyst effective CO2 conversion under natural sunlight one hour before sunset during the winter season, putting forward an important step towards practical solar fuel production.

&lt;p&gt;A potassium-modified carbon-supported cobalt catalyst mimicking the structure of a lotus pod is developed. With hierarchical pores, intimate Co/C interfaces, and exposed catalytic sites, the catalyst shows a record-high photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation rate with near-unity selectivity for CO.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is one of the most promising routes to efficiently utilize solar energy for fuel production at high rates. However, this reaction is currently limited by underdeveloped catalysts with low photothermal conversion efficiency, insufficient exposure of active sites, low active material loading, and high material cost. Herein, we report a potassium-modified carbon-supported cobalt (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Co&#8722;C) catalyst mimicking the structure of a lotus pod that addresses these challenges.

         <title>Exploring the Strain Effect in Single Particle Electrochemistry using Pd Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy enables the high throughput analysis of individual well&#8208;shaped Pd nanocrystals to estimate the intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity and reveal the structural origin of surface strain for the superior activity.







Abstract
Tuning the surface strain of heterogeneous catalysts is recognized as a powerful strategy for tailoring their catalytic activity. However, a clear understanding of the strain effect in electrocatalysis at single&#8208;particle resolution is still lacking. Here, we explore the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of single Pd octahedra and icosahedra with the same surface bounded {111} crystal facet and similar sizes using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). It is revealed that tensilely strained Pd icosahedra display significantly superior HER electrocatalytic activity. The estimated turnover frequency at &#8722;0.87&#8197;V vs RHE on Pd icosahedra is about two times higher than that on Pd octahedra. Our single&#8208;particle electrochemistry study using SECCM at Pd nanocrystals unambiguously highlights the importance of tensile strain on electrocatalytic activity and may offer new strategy for understanding the fundamental relationship between surface strain and reactivity.

         <title>Unraveling Oxidation Behaviors of MXenes in Aqueous Systems by Active Learning Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes are two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with great potential in application to various fields. However, the degradation of MXenes in humid environments has become a main obstacle in their practical use. Here we combine deep neural networks and an active learning scheme to develop a neural network potential (NNP) for aqueous MXene systems with ab initio precision but the low cost. The oxidation behaviors of the super large MXenes aqueous system are investigated systematically at nanosecond timescales for the first time. The oxidation process of MXenes is clearly displayed at the atomic level. And free protons and oxides greatly inhibit subsequent oxidation reactions, leading to the degree of oxidation of MXenes to exponential decay with time, which is consistent with the oxidation rate of MXenes measured experimentally. Importantly, this computational study represents the first exploration of the kinetic process of oxidation reaction in the super&#8208;sized MXene aqueous system. This significant breakthrough opens a promising avenue for the future development of effective protection strategies aimed at controlling the stability of MXenes. Besides, the developed NNP could be used in other applications of complex aqueous MXene systems after adding new data.</dc:description>

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Assisted Ball Assembly for Solvent&#8208;Processing the C60 Electron Transport Layer of High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pristine fullerene C60 is an excellent electron transport material for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inverted structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but its low solubility leaves thermal evaporation as the only method for depositing it into a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL). To address this problem, we herein introduce a highly soluble bowl&#8208;shaped additive, corannulene, to assist in C60&#8208;assembly into a smooth and compact film through the favorable bowl&#8208;ball interaction. Our results show that not only corannulene can dramatically enhance the film formability of C60, it also plays a critical role in forming C60&#8208;corannulene (CC) supramolecular species and in boosting intermolecular electron transport dynamics in the ETL. This strategy has allowed CC devices to deliver high power conversion efficiencies up to 21.69%, which is the highest value among the PSCs based on the solution&#8208;processed&#8208;C60 (SP&#8208;C60) ETL. Moreover, the stability of the CC device is far superior to that of the C60&#8208;only device because corannulene can retard and curb the spontaneous aggregation of C60. This work establishes the bowl&#8208;assisted ball assembly strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient SP&#8208;C60 ETLs with high promise for fully&#8208;SP PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Productivity of the Direct Conversion of Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Copper&#8208;Exchanged Zeolite Omega (MAZ) via Oxygen Looping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion via the oxygen looping approach using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites has been extensively studied over the last decade. While a lot of research has focussed on maximizing yield and selectivity, little has been directed toward productivity &#8208; a metric far more meaningful for evaluating industrial potential. Using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega), a material highly active and selective for the MtM conversion using the isothermal oxygen looping approach, we show that this material exhibits unprecedented potential for industrial valorization. In doing so, we also present a novel methodology combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry for the screening of materials for the MtM conversion in oxygen looping mode.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8722;X&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8722;N Halogen Bonds in Complexes of N&#8208;Haloimides and Pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides: A Large Data Set Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8211;X&#183;&#183;&#183;&#8722;O&#8211;N+ halogen&#8208;bonded systems formed by 27 pyridine N&#8208;oxides (PyNOs) as halogen bond (XB) acceptors and two N&#8208;halosuccinimides, two N&#8208;halophthalimides, and two N&#8208;halosaccharins as XB donors are studied in silico, in solution, and in the solid state. This large set of data (132 DFT optimized structures, 75 crystal structures, and 168 1H NMR titrations) provides a unique view to structural and bonding properties. In the computational part, a simple electrostatic model (SiElMo) for predicting XB energies using only the properties of halogen donors and oxygen acceptors is developed. The SiElMo energies are in perfect accord with energies calculated from XB complexes optimized with two high&#8208;level DFT approaches. Data from in silico bond energies and single crystal X&#8208;ray structures correlate, however data from solution do not. The polydentate bonding characteristic of the PyNOs&#8217; oxygen in solution, as revealed by solid&#8208;state structures, is attributed to the lack of correlation between DFT/solid&#8208;state and solution data. XB strength is only slightly affected by the PyNO oxygen properties [(atomic charge (Q), ionization energy (Is,min) and local negative minima (Vs,min)], as the &#120590;&#8208;hole (Vs,max) of the donor halogen is the key determinant leading to the sequence N&#8208;halosaccharin&gt;N&#8208;halosuccinimide&gt; N&#8208;halophthalimide on the XB strength.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;N&#8211;X&#183;&#183;&#183;&#8722;O&#8211;N+ halogen-bonded systems formed by 27 pyridine N-oxides (PyNOs) as halogen bond (XB) acceptors and two N-halosuccinimides, two N-halophthalimides, and two N-halosaccharins as XB donors are studied in silico, in solution, and in the solid state. This large set of data (132 DFT optimized structures, 75 crystal structures, and 168 1H NMR titrations) provides a unique view to structural and bonding properties. In the computational part, a simple electrostatic model (SiElMo) for predicting XB energies using only the properties of halogen donors and oxygen acceptors is developed. The SiElMo energies are in perfect accord with energies calculated from XB complexes optimized with two high-level DFT approaches.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric STING Pro&#8208;agonists for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic ImmunotherapyaThe efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing the off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo&#8208;Ni&#8208;based Heterojunction with Fine&#8208;customized d&#8208;Band Centers for Hydrogen Production Coupled with Benzylamine Electrooxidation in Low Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR) is a promising route to produce value&#8208;added, easy&#8208;separated benzonitrile, and effectively hoist H2 production. However, achieving excellent performance in low alkaline medium is a huge challenge. The performance is intimately correlated with effective coupling of HER and BAOR, which can be achieved by manipulating the d&#8208;electron structure of catalyst to regulate the active species from water. Herein, we constructed a biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8208;Ni3N heterojunction for enhanced bifunctional performance toward HER coupled with BAOR by customizing the d&#8208;band centers. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that charge transfer in the heterojunction causes the upshift of the d&#8208;band centers, which one side facilitates to decrease water activation energy and optimize H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER activity, the other side favors to more easily produce and adsorb OH* from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N and optimizing adsorption energy of benzylamine, thus catalyzing BAOR effectively. Accordingly, it shows an industrial current density of 220 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.59 V and high Faradaic efficiencies &gt; 99% for H2 production and converting benzylamine to benzonitrile in 0.1 M KOH/0.5 M Na2SO4. This work guides the design of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for the scalable production of green hydrogen and value&#8208;added products.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Principles for Maximizing Hole Utilization of Semiconductor Quantum Wires toward Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximizing hole transfer kinetics &#8212; usually a rate&#8208;determining step in semiconductor&#8208;based artificial photosynthesis &#8212; is pivotal for simultaneously enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar hydrogen production and hole utilization. However, this remains elusive yet as efforts are largely focused on optimizing the electron&#8208;involved half&#8208;reactions only by empirically employing sacrificial electron donors (SEDs) to consume the wasted holes. Here, using high&#8208;quality ZnSe quantum wires as models, we show that how hole transfer processes in different SEDs affect their photocatalytic performances. We found that larger driving forces of SEDs monotonically enhance hole transfer rates and photocatalytic performances by almost three orders of magnitude, a result conforming well with the Auger&#8208;assisted hole transfer model in quantum&#8208;confined systems. Intriguingly, further loading Pt cocatalyts can yield either an Auger&#8208;assisted model or a Marcus inverted region for electron transfer, depending on the competing hole transfer kinetics in SEDs. These findings formulate the design principles for maximizing hole utilization in synergistic solar hydrogen production and photocatalytic oxidations.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique intrinsic properties. The synergy between dual atoms provides flexible active sites, promising to enhance performance and even catalyze more complex reactions. However, precisely regulating active site structure and uncovering dual&#8208;atom metal interaction remain grand challenges. In this review, we clarify the significance of the inter&#8208;metal interaction of DACs based on the understanding of active center structures. Three diatomic configurations are elaborated, including isolated dual single&#8208;atom, N/O&#8208;bridged dual&#8208;atom, and direct dual&#8208;metal bonding interaction. Subsequently, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress in heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions are summarized. The structure&#8208;activity&#160;relationship between DACs and catalytic performance is then discussed at an atomic level. Finally, the challenges and future directions to engineer the structure of DACs are discussed. This review will offer new prospects for the rational design of efficient DACs toward heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit&#8208;Identification in a Rigid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for ppm&#8208;Level CO2 Removal and Ultra&#8208;Pure CO Enrichment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removing CO2 from crude syngas via physical adsorption is an effective method to yield eligible syngas. However, the bottleneck in trapping ppm&#8208;level CO2 and improving CO purity at higher working temperatures are major challenges. Here we report a thermoresponsive metal&#8208;organic framework (1a&#8208;apz), assembled by rigid Mg2(dobdc) (1a) and aminopyrazine (apz), which not only affords an ultra&#8208;high CO2 capacity (145.0/197.6 cm3 g&#8208;1 (0.01/0.1 bar) at 298 K) but also produces ultra&#8208;pure CO (purity &#8805; 99.99%) at a practical ambient temperature (TA). Several characterization results, including variable&#8208;temperature tests, in&#8208;situ high&#8208;resolution synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;SXRD), and simulations, explicitly unravel that the excellent property is attributed to the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification in 1a&#8208;apz that comprises self&#8208;adaption of apz, multiple binding sites, and complementary electrostatic potential (ESP). Breakthrough tests suggest that 1a&#8208;apz can remove CO2 from 1/99 CO2/CO mixtures at practical 348 K, yielding 70.5 L kg&#8208;1 of CO with ultra&#8208;high purity of &#8805; 99.99%. The excellent separation performance is also revealed by separating crude syngas that contains quinary mixtures of H2/N2/CH4/CO/CO2 (46/18.3/2.4/32.3/1, v/v/v/v/v).</dc:description>

         <title>Directly Imaging and Regulating the Nanoscale Inhomogeneity of S&#8208;Vacancies in Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayer during Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of electron transfer event on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides has attracted tremendous attentions attributing to their promising applications in electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrate an opto&#8208;electrochemical strategy to directly map and regulate electron transfer event on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer by combining bright field (BF) imaging technique with electrochemical modulation. The heterogeneity of electrochemical activity on MoS2 monolayer down to nanoscale is resolved spatiotemporally. The thermodynamics of MoS2 monolayer is measured during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the Arrhenius correlations are obtained. We validate that the defect generation engineered by oxygen plasma bombardment dramatically enhances the local electrochemical activity of MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to point defects of S&#8208;vacancies as evidenced. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of electron transfer event on MoS2 with various layers, the interlayer coupling effect is uncovered. This study represents a facile method to image the heterogeneity of electrochemical properties for nanomaterials with atomic thickness and regulate the local activity within the plane by extrinsic factors. It also has potential applications in the design and evaluation of high&#8208;performance layered electrochemical systems down to nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#160;Based Crosslinked Porous Microcapsules for Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of porous microcapsules with selective mass transfer and mechanical robustness for enzyme encapsulation is highly desired for biocatalysis, yet the construction remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile fabrication of porous microcapsules by assembling covalent organic framework (COF) spheres at the interfaces of emulsion droplets followed by interparticle crosslinking. The COF microcapsules could offer an enclosed aqueous environment for enzymes, with size&#8208;selective porous shells that allow for the fast diffusion of substrates and products while excluding larger molecules such as protease. Crosslinking of COF spheres not only enhances the structural stability of capsules but also imparts enrichment effects. The enzymes encased in the COF microcapsules show enhanced activity and durability in organic media as verified in both batch reaction and continuous&#8208;flow reaction. The COF microcapsules offer a promising platform for the encapsulation of biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium and Ruthenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Porous Ionic Polymers for Acetylene Dialkoxycarbonylation: Synergetic Effects Stabilize the Active Site and Increase CO Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts usually suffer from the poor stability, limiting its industrial applications. Herein, the dual&#8208;sites Pd1&#8208;Ru1 supported on porous ionic polymers (Pd1&#8208;Ru1/PIPs) was constructed using wetness&#160;impregnation method. The two isolated metal species in the form of binuclear complex was immobilized on the cationic framework of PIPs through ionic bonds. Compared to the single&#8208;Pd or Ru&#8208;site catalyst, it exhibits higher activity with 98% acetylene conversion and near 100% selectivity of dialkoxycarbonylation products as well as better cycling stability for ten times cycles without obvious decay. Based on DFT calculations, it was found that the single&#8208;Ru&#8208;site exhibited a strong CO adsorption energy of &#8208;1.6 eV, leading to an increase in the local CO concentration of the catalyst. Notably, the Pd1&#8208;Ru1/PIPs catalyst had a much lower energy barrier of 2.49 eV compared to 3.87 eV of Pd1/PIPs for the rate&#8208;determining step. The synergetic effect between neighbouring single&#8208;sites Pd1 and Ru1 not only enhanced the overall activity, but also stabilized Pd(II) active sites. The discovery of synergetic effect between single&#8208;sites can deepen our understanding of single&#8208;site catalysts at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of conjugated polymers especially n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di&#8208;metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron&#8208;deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. Then, a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well&#8208;defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process. Interestingly, the resulted metallopolymers with d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugations are very promising electron transport layer materials which can boost photovoltaic performance of an organic solar cell, with power conversion efficiency up to 18.28% based on the PM6:EH&#8208;HD&#8208;4F non&#8208;fullerene system.

         <title>Molecular Flytraps Held Together by Platinum&#8211;Platinum Intermetallic Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;metal bonds have rarely been sighted in the supramolecular realm, yet they can provide a number of features from which to harvest dynamic behavior and responsiveness. Here, a single Pt&#8722;Pt bond was used to glue two cyclometalated hosts together and generate a flytrap&#8208;like molecule. This compound traps inorganic ions in its jaw, assembles and disassembles photochemically, and irreversibly transports guests from solution to the solid state.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal bonds have rarely been explored as active elements in supramolecular assemblies despite their unique potential to introduce responsive behavior. In this report, a dynamic molecular container composed of two cyclometalated Pt units is constructed using Pt&#8722;Pt bonds. This molecule&#8212;the flytrap&#8212;has a flexible jaw composed of two [18]crown&#8208;6 ethers that can adapt their shape to bind large inorganic cations with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity. Along with the spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the flytrap, we report its photochemical assembly, which allows the capture of ions and their transport from solution to the solid state. In addition, we have been able to recycle the flytrap to regenerate its starting material due to the reversible nature of the Pt&#8722;Pt bond. We believe that other molecular containers and materials for harvesting valuable substrates from solution could be assembled using the advances presented here.

         <title>Tetrazole Linkages as Photoactivated Fuels for Light&#8208;Regulated Photothermal/Photocatalytic Propulsion of Versatile Polymer Nanoplatforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated versatile polymer nanoplatforms with asymmetric geometry enable on&#8208;demand integration of various functionalities via tetrazole linkages. In response to UV or visible light, tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels simultaneously perform photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the polymer nanoplatforms for powering the multimode synergistic propulsion, thus showing potential in bio&#8208;applications.







Abstract
Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light&#8208;regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole&#8208;containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on&#8208;demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Optimizing Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction via Interfacial Electric Field Modulation: Elevating d&#8208;Band Center in WS2&#8208;WO3 for Enhanced Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 can enhance the adsorption of intermediates by elevating the d&#8208;band center of W, resulting in an accelerated electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) kinetics.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing green ammonia under ambient conditions. Tungsten (W) is one of the most effective ENRR catalysts. In this reaction, the protonation of intermediates is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Enhancing the adsorption of intermediates is crucial to increase the protonation of intermediates, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. Herein, we constructed a strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 to elevate the d&#8208;band center of W, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach led to a significantly improved ENRR performance. Specifically, WS2&#8208;WO3 exhibited a high NH3 yield of 62.38&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a promoted faraday efficiency (FE) of 24.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations showed that the strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 upshifted the d&#8208;band center of W towards the Fermi level, leading to enhanced adsorption of &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;NH intermediates on the catalyst surface. This resulted in a significantly promoted reaction rate of the RDS. Overall, our study offers new insights into the relationship between interfacial electric field and d&#8208;band center and provides a promising strategy to enhance the intermediates adsorption during the ENRR process.

         <title>Supramolecularly Engineered Reporters with Superoxide Anion&#8208;Triggered Chemiluminescence for Early Diagnosis and Efficient Amelioration of Acute Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecularly engineered chemiluminescence reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate, chlorin e6 and superoxide dismutase, are reported. The PCCS reporters were applied for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury.







Abstract
We report the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; preparation of kidney injury molecule&#8208;1&#8208;targeting supramolecular chemiluminescence (CL) reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid (PLGA)&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), for early diagnosis and amelioration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this system, O2&#8901;&#8722;, a biomarker of AKI, triggers the oxidation of CPPO to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanedione and subsequent CL emission via CL resonance energy transfer to Ce6. The L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA stabilizes CPPO and Ce6 via noncovalent interactions, promoting long&#8208;lived CL (half&#8208;lives: &#8776;1000&#8197;s). Transcriptomics analysis shows that PCCS reporters reduce the inflammatory response through glutathione metabolism and inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The reporters are able to non&#8208;invasively detect AKI at least 12&#8197;h earlier than current assays, and their antioxidant properties allow simultaneous treatment of AKI.

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 40&#8197;years development of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes for rechargeable batteries has been reviewed. Critical insights are given from both underlying mechanistic and practical engineering aspects while we traverse the history on the rational design of low&#8208;temperature electrolyte systems.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li+ diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low&#8208;temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low&#8208;temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes in the past 40&#8197;years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylated [Ge9] clusters form a novel type of chromophore system. Protonation of a covalently cluster&#8208;bound imine moiety results in an intense color change from red to green. Transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations on the protonated form reveal ultrafast dynamics upon photoexcitation leading to a charge&#8208;transfer between the cluster and the imine moiety, thus giving the proof of principle for a cluster&#8208;imine dyad.







Abstract
C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8722; (1&#8722;) is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS=trimethylsilyl; DAB(II)=1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8722; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;=669&#8197;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.

[Ge&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;{Si(TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C=N}-DAB(II)&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) is formed upon the reaction of [Ge&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;{Si(TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with bromo-diazaborole DAB(II)&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;-Br in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN (TMS=trimethylsilyl; DAB(II)=1,3,2-diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp=2,6-di-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;{Si(TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C=N(H)}-DAB(II)&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1-H&lt;/b&gt;) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time-dependent density functional theory suggests a charge-transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of &lt;b&gt;1-H&lt;/b&gt; in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest-energy excited state at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=669&#8197;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo-active cluster compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expedient Access to Enantioenriched 1&#8208;Azaspiro Cyclobutanones Enabled by Modified Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leveraging the unexplored regions of chemical space, the integration of spirocyclic cyclobutane in a molecular scaffold opens up a new vista in modern drug discovery. Despite recent advancements in achieving such motifs, the strategies for their asymmetric construction have not been well&#8208;recognized and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;azaspiro cyclobutanone enabled by an unusual reactivity of enamine that explore the potentiality of Heyns rearrangement upon electrophilic modification. This design strategy offers viable access to a wide range of cyclobutanone containing spiroindoline and spiropyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee, &gt;20: 1 dr). Furthermore, the practicality of this methodology has been manifested by a scale&#8208;up synthesis of spirocyclic products and their facile post&#8208;synthetic modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Gas Escape in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis by Gas Diffusion Layers with Hierarchical Grid Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At high current densities, gas bubble escape is the critical factor affecting the mass transport and performance of the electrolyzer. For tight assembly water electrolysis technologies, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between the catalyst layer (CL) and the flow field plate plays a critical role in gas bubble removal. Herein, we demonstrate that the electrolyzer&#8217;s mass transport and performance can be significantly improved by simply manipulating the structure of the GDL. Combined with 3D printing technology, ordered nickel GDLs with straight&#8208;through pores and adjustable grid&#160;sizes are systematically studied. Using an in&#8208;situ high&#8208;speed camera, the gas bubble releasing size and resident time have been observed and analyzed upon the change of the GDL architecture. The results show that a suitable grid size of the GDL can significantly accelerate mass transport by reducing the gas bubble size and the bubble resident time. An adhesive force measurement has further revealed the underlying mechanism. We then proposed and fabricated a novel hierarchical GDL, reaching a current density of 2 A/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.95 V and 80 oC, one of the highest single&#8208;cell performances in pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Reprogramming of Macrophages by Chiral Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is known that extracellular free radical  reactive oxygen species (ROS) rather than intracellular ROS plays a non&#8208;substitutable role in regulation of tumor&#8208;suppressing (M1) tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization. However, most therapeutic nanoplatforms mainly provide intracellular ROS and exhibit insufficient accumulation near TAMs, which strongly limits the macrophage&#8208;based immunotherapeutic effects. Here we design and synthesize chiral MoS2/CoS2 nanozymes with peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities to efficiently modulate TAMs polarization and reverse tumor immunosuppression by harnessing their chirality&#8208;specific interactions with biological systems. MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles coordinated with d&#8208;chirality (d &#8208;NPs, right&#8208;handed) show improved pharmacokinetics with longer circulating half&#8208;life and higher tumor accumulation compared with their l (left&#8208;handed)&#8208; and dl (racemate)&#8208;counterparts. Further, d&#8208;NPs can escape from macrophage uptake in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with the aid of cell&#8208;unpreferred opposite chirality and act as extracellular hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and oxygen (O2) generators to efficiently repolarize TAMs into M1 phenotype. On the contrary, l&#8208;NPs showed high cellular uptake due to chirality&#8208;driven homologous adhesion between l&#8208;NPs and macrophage membrane, leading to limited M1 polarization performance. As the first example for developing chiral nanozymes as extracellular&#8208;localized ROS generators to reprogram TAMs for cancer immunotherapy, this study opens an avenue for applications of chiral nanozymes in immunomodulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Group 14 Element Hetero&#8208;Difunctionalizations via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difunctionalization of unsaturated bonds plays a vital role in the enrichment of molecular complexity. While various catalytic methods for alkene and alkyne difunctionalization have been developed in recent years, hetero&#8208;functionalization the introduction of two different atoms has been less explored. This is mainly due to the challenges associated with achieving high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, especially when adding two similar atoms from the same group across unsaturated bonds. In this study, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, three&#8208;component reductive protocol for group 14 element hetero&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes using electrochemistry. This new method is mild, selective, and general, allowing for the silyl&#8208;, germanyl&#8208;, and stannyl&#8208;alkylation of enynes. Various chlorosilanes as well as chlorogermans, and chlorostannanes can be successfully used in combination with aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted 1, 3&#8208;enynes and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides in the electroreductive coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications of Helical &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers Derived from a Thioether&#8208;Containing Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a novel cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC), as a versatile building block for designing peptide foldamers with controlled secondary structures. We synthesized and characterized a series of &#946;&#8208;peptide hexamers containing ATTC using various techniques, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that ATTC&#8208;containing foldamers can adopt 12&#8208;helical conformations similar to their isosteres and offer the possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their properties via post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In particular, chemoselective conjugation strategies demonstrate that ATTC provides unique post&#8208;synthetic modification opportunities, which expand their potential applications across diverse research areas. Collectively, our study highlights the versatility and utility of ATTC as an alternative to previously reported cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks in both structural and functional aspects, paving the way for future research in the realm of peptide foldamers and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes: Hypervalent Iodine Meets High&#8208;Valent Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first trifluoromethylation of vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) is reported herein. The synthetic method is based bench&#8208;stable, high&#8208;valent copper(III) species and can be initiated under thermal conditions and/or irradiation (365&#160;nm) giving access to trifluoromethylated alkenes stereoselectively. Various VBX reagents derived from tyrosine, cysteine, small peptides, thiols and amides can be used as precursors. The obtained alkenes could be further functionalized by reduction or epoxidation of the trifluoromethylated double bond. Furthermore, the method could be applied in a large&#8208;scale batch/flow synthesis and could be performed under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Hypervalent Iodine Reagent Chimeras: Enabling Peptide Functionalization and Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel strategy for the modification of peptides based on the introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208; ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8208; onto peptides. These peptide&#8208;EBXs can be easily accessed, both via solution and solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein via reaction with Cys, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine adducts in water buffer. In addition, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C&#8208;terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye. This later reaction was also successful in an intramolecular way, leading to macrocyclic peptides with unprecedented crosslinking. The rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity to Keap1 at the Nrf2 binding site with potential protein&#8208;protein interaction inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;inflammatory Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Colitis Treatment: Construction and In Vivo Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Common medications for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have limited therapeutic efficacy and severe adverse effects. This underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively target inflamed sites in the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration, exerting potent therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic effects. Here, we report the construction and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of a library of anti&#8208;inflammatory glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (designated GlyNPs) in a mouse model of IBD. The anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNP library was created by attaching bilirubin (BR) to a library of glycopolymers composed of random combinations of the five most naturally abundant sugars. Direct in vivo screening of 31 BR&#8208;attached anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNPs via oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate GlyNP capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms. These findings suggest that the BR&#8208;attached GlyNP library can be used as a platform to identify anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicines for various inflammatory diseases.</dc:description>
