         <title>&#8220;Outside&#8208;in&#8221;Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Linking Specific Peripheral Geometry to Defined CO2 Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) through microenvironment engineering, particularly via peripheral species, has recently garnered significant attention in the fields of materials science and heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, establishing unambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships for SAC, especially concerning peripheral effects, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy for the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Fe SACs for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory calculations reveal that installing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring in the outer shell modulates the electronic properties of the inner&#8208;shell coordination N species, altering their electron transfer capabilities while fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;p coupling between the Fe center and adjacent N atoms. Notably, five&#8208;membered rings induce stronger d&#8208;p coupling compared to their six&#8208;membered counterparts, leading to higher Fe valance state. This electronic modulation optimizes the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (COOH* and CO*), enhancing catalytic performance for CO production. Extensive experimental studies corroborate these theoretical findings. The proposed &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; design strategy can be extended to Ni SACs, offering new insights into the exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom centers through peripheral geometric effects.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a strategy for the design of N-doped carbon-supported Fe SACs for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory calculations reveal that installing five- or six-membered ring in the outer shell modulates the electronic properties of the inner-shell coordination N species, altering their electron transfer capabilities while fine-tuning the d-p coupling between the Fe center and adjacent N atoms. Notably, five-membered rings induce stronger d-p coupling compared to their six-membered counterparts, leading to higher Fe valance state. This electronic modulation optimizes the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (COOH* and CO*), enhancing catalytic performance for CO production.

         <title>Controlled Electrocatalytic Glycerol Upgrading to Glyceraldehyde in Near Neutral Media by Cobalt Oxide Lattice Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol driven by renewable electricity offers a greatly attractive green way to produce value&#8208;added chemicals at much reduced global carbon footprint. However, achieving both the enhanced activity and selectivity for the most&#8208;valuable C3 product&#8208;&#8208;glyceraldehyde (GAD) of glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR)&#160; in neutral&#160;media, though of great importance, is extremely challenging. In this work, we propose a Co3O4&#160;lattice activation mechanism by introducing single atom Ru (0.36 wt%) into the CoTd sites of Co3O4 lattice to significantly elevate the GOR activity and the GAD selectivity by GOR. The as&#8208;constructed Ru&#8208;Co3O4/NF only needs 1.16 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 during GOR and maintains ~60% GAD selectivity (~90% for C3 products) over a broad potential window, which are the highest reported in near neutral media. This excellent performance has been demonstrated to originate from the introduction of Ru atoms, which activates the lattice active sites of Co3O4 by promoting the rapid reconstruction of the catalyst to generate sufficient Co3+&#8208;(OH)ads&#160;electrophilic oxygen species, resulting in not only the accelerated GOR kinetics, also largely enhanced selectivity of GAD by the adsorption configuration regulation of glycerol primary alcohols (C&#945;&#8208;OH) favoring the primary alcohol oxidation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Branched&#8208;Selective Functionalization of 2&#8208;Alkyl Aziridines through Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overriding the inherent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity in aziridine activation holds significant potential. It could enable previously inaccessible disconnections from these readily available, strained heterocycles, facilitating the diverse synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing products. In this study, we present a Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl (and 2,2&#8208;dialkyl) aziridines, leading to unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling with styrenes and reductive defluorinative coupling with trifluoromethyl alkenes. In addition to&#160;enabling the functionalization of the N&#8208;adjacent sites of aziridines, this catalyst&#8208;controlled activation strategy triggers an unprecedented reaction framework for aziridines, namely, the remote desaturation via ring&#8208;opening. Notably, detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate the operation of a rare 'self&#8208;terminated' chain&#8208;walking process, offering a flexible method for remote desaturation that generates alkenyl amines with varying chain lengths. Overall, this study provides a modular approach to access a wide range of alkenyl amine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Chiral Catalan Solid based on Molybdenum Halide with Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Deep&#8208;red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of novel chiral metal halides with exceptional chiroptical properties has attracted significant research attention due to their potential applications in chiral optoelectronics and spintronics. However, developing the deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters is still challenging. In this work, we presented the first chiral molybdenum halide clusters, (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra, which adopt the unique Catalan solid structure. These tetrakis hexahedra exhibit 24 unique 3c&#8208;2e Mo&#8208;Mo&#8208;Cl bonding, which is scarcely reported. Most importantly, these (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra exhibit strong circularly polarized luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region, accompanied by a longer emission lifetime of 114.14 &#956;s at room temperature. Additionally, these chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra are optically stable for three months. The four&#8208;state spin sublevel model was employed to investigate the emission mechanism and found that the temperature&#8208;dependent exciton dynamics lead to the dual&#8208;band emission of the designed tetrakis hexahedra. Our study expands the family of lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides and develops a novel strategy to design the high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;red CPL emitter.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Red Light&#8208;Driven Singlet Oxygen Photocatalysis with an Osmium&#8208;Based Coulombic Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive osmium complexes are widely used sensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen, because they can be excited directly into their triplet states with low&#8208;energy red light. However, their short&#8208;lived excited states reduce quenching efficiencies and reaction quantum yields significantly. To elongate the excited state lifetime, osmium complexes have been linked to organic chromophores to form molecular dyads. This approach, while effective, is time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming, hampering larger&#8208;scale applications. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach by directly mixing a readily available cationic osmium complex and an anionic perylene derivative in solution. Strong Coulombic interactions facilitate rapid energy transfer (~100 ps) from the excited osmium complex to the perylene derivative, mimicking a dyad&#8208;like system. Detailed spectroscopic investigations revealed an increased singlet oxygen formation rate by over one order of magnitude at sub&#8208;millimolar perylene concentrations, attributed to (i) the three orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the perylene triplet state produced via intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair energy transfer and (ii) an inherently high singlet oxygen quantum yield of that key species. The novel catalyst system enables highly productive photooxygenations in water and in a MeOH/H2O 10/1 mixture, highlighting the broad applicability and versatility of the Coulombic dyad approach for photocatalytic synthesis and wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Angularly Resolved Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite intensive research in tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), the angular distribution of Raman scattering in the TERS gap remains experimentally unreported leaving its relevance to the TERS signal formation to be seldomly discussed. Here, we investigate the angular distribution of the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal in the Fourier plane using a model system composed of flat&#8208;lying cobalt (II) hexadecafluoro&#8208;phthalocyanine (CoPcF16) molecules physically adsorbed on a smooth gold surface. Both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational modes are observed, where the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Raman modes at about 678 cm&#8208;1 and 740 cm&#8208;1 have different angular intensity distributions than those of in&#8208;plane Raman modes at 1309 cm&#8208;1 and 1373 cm&#8208;1. We interpret the angular spectrum of the TERS signal considering the molecular vibrational modes computed with density functional theory (DFT) for the free and gold&#8208;deposited, and the directed Raman scattering by the gap&#8208;mode predicted by Finite&#8208;Difference Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) simulations. We contend that the TERS gap directs the Raman vibrational modes differently, leading to distinct angularly distributed Raman scattering intensities. These findings emphasize the non&#8208;negligible role of the TERS detection scheme in understanding spectral features, such as the relative peak intensity ratio variations for studying molecular orientations, or for monitoring chemical reactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite intensive research in tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), the angular distribution of Raman scattering in the TERS gap remains experimentally unreported leaving its relevance to the TERS signal formation to be seldomly discussed. Here, we investigate the angular distribution of the tip-enhanced Raman signal in the Fourier plane using a model system composed of flat-lying cobalt (II) hexadecafluoro-phthalocyanine (CoPcF16) molecules physically adsorbed on a smooth gold surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational modes are observed, where the out-of-plane Raman modes at about 678 cm-1 and 740 cm-1 have different angular intensity distributions than those of in-plane Raman modes at 1309 cm-1 and 1373 cm-1. We interpret the angular spectrum of the TERS signal considering the molecular vibrational modes computed with density functional theory (DFT) for the free and gold-deposited, and the directed Raman scattering by the gap-mode predicted by Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations. We contend that the TERS gap directs the Raman vibrational modes differently, leading to distinct angularly distributed Raman scattering intensities. These findings emphasize the non-negligible role of the TERS detection scheme in understanding spectral features, such as the relative peak intensity ratio variations for studying molecular orientations, or for monitoring chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a Linear Tetraboron Cation via Deprotonation of a Non&#8208;supported Dimeric Hydroborylborenium Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;supported B&#8208;H&#8208;B moiety of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion can be readily deprotonated by 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, affording a H&#8208;bridged linear tetraboron cation. The resulting tetraboron cation shows diverse reactivity with small molecules. Treatment of this tetraboron cation with H2 leads to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. Additionally, during the preparation of the hydroborylborenium, an unprecedented formal boryl cage&#8208;walking was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this process involves consecutive activation of carboranyl B(9)&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures in Siloxane Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high&#8208;voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental characterizations. Siloxane electrolytes have been demonstrated to deliver anion&#8208;rich solvation structures, which are induced by weak Li ion (Li+)&#8211;solvent interactions and strong Li+&#8211;anion interactions. The silicon (Si)&#8211;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than carbon (C)&#8211;O of C&#8208;siloxane (Replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#8211;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability. This work reveals the mechanism of interfacial stability and intrinsic stability of siloxane electrolytes, providing a theoretical basis for the practical application of siloxane electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Application of high&#8208;pressure conditions in chemical synthesis has proven to access a wide range of novel nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds and to overcome the stability of the dinitrogen molecule. In the present work, we report the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature (HPHT) synthesis of Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x), which features double&#8208;layers of poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine) [C4N6x&#8208;]n and non&#8208;polymerized guanidinate anions CN35&#8208;. The structure model was determined by means of synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is fully corroborated by theoretical calculations. The poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine) illustrates an example of a 2D polymerized anionic C&#8211;N network and represents the first intermediate between highly charged CN35&#8208; anions and fully condensed graphitic carbon nitride networks achieved by HPHT conditions. This opens a pathway to widely varied family of hydrogen&#8208;free nitridocarbonates, which has the potential to develop into an alternative synthesis route to classical polycondensation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the effort to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including (TD&#8208;)DFT and ADC(2) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead shows that photoswitching proceeds on the T&#8321; PES. These insights enhance our understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference from oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) of bismuth oxychloride with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield after photocatalytic N2 reduction under solar light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to overcome confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect, leading to &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing their transfer path from (001) to (101) crystal plane. As a result, a new nitrogen reduction pathway with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation is found, as reported by Wen Liu et&#160;al. (e202503097).

         <title>Mechanistic Insights: Correspondence on &#8220;Tuning Co&#8208;Operative Energy Transfer in Copper(I) Complexes Using Two&#8208;Photon Absorbing Diimine&#8208;Based Ligand Sensitizers&#8221;</title>

One photon or two photons, that is the question. A closer look at the recently presented photosensitizer [Cu(bathocupSANI)2]BF4 revealed that a single red/NIR photon per catalytic turnover is sufficient for photooxygenation reactions. Mechanistic challenges, pitfalls, and opportunities for future research in photocatalysis are identified.








Abstract
In a recent communication, Collins and coworkers presented a Cu(I) complex with photocatalytic activity under red light LED conditions, mainly for singlet oxygen&#8208;driven reactions. Guided by steady&#8208;state emission measurements with 800&#160;nm excitation, the authors suggested that the underlying mechanism for the generation of the photoexcited key species is a simultaneous two&#8208;photon absorption via a virtual state. However, such a mechanism requires pulsed laser excitation and cannot compete when a conventional one&#8208;photon excitation is also feasible with the selected excitation wavelength range. Using several spectroscopic techniques and reactivity assays under different light color and intensity conditions, we unambiguously demonstrate that a conventional one&#8208;photon excitation followed by rather inefficient singlet oxygen generation (quantum yield&#160;&lt;5%) is responsible for the observed photoreactivity of the Cu(I) complex. In addition, we briefly summarize general mechanistic considerations, estimate typical photon densities required for a variety of two&#8208;photon mechanisms, highlight the importance of optical filters and impurities to avoid artifacts in the emission spectra, and present some guidelines for the differentiation between one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon mechanisms.

         <title>Enantiomerically Enriched Aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Kinetic Resolution of 2H&#8208;Azirines</title>

Kinetic resolution by copper hydride catalyzed reduction of 2H&#8208;azirines secured optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and good enantioselectivity (up to 94% ee). DFT calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis established the reaction pathway and revealed two key non&#8208;covalent interactions that account for the enantioselectivity.








Abstract
We present the first reductive kinetic resolution of racemic 2H&#8208;azirines to prepare optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, which are bench stable and readily diversifiable building blocks, concomitantly with the corresponding enantiomerically enriched 2H&#8208;azirines. The N&#8208;H aziridines were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94%). A Hammett study revealed a linear free energy relationship between the &#916;&#916;G&#10727; of the diastereomeric transition states and the &#963;p&#8722; values. density functional theory (DFT) calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis suggested that non&#8208;classical H&#8211;bonding interactions and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions between the substrate and the ligand are responsible for the stereoselectivity and also for the substrate electronic effects observed in the Hammett study.

         <title>Identification of an Activity Selector for the Nitroso&#8208;Forming Activity in Bacterial Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but crucial difference: Type&#8208;III copper enzymes, like tyrosinase (TYR) and o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase (AO), catalyze the oxidation of o&#8208;aminophenols (AP) to quinone imines. Unlike TYR, AO can further oxidize AP to nitrosophenols. This nitroso&#8208;forming activity is controlled by a key amino acid near the Cu(A) ion. Mutating Asn to Ile in the AO SgGriF converts it to a TYR, while the homologous Ile to Asn mutation in SzTYR switches it from a TYR to an AO. 








Abstract
O&#8208;aminophenol oxidases, a specialized subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive nitrosophenols, which display antiretroviral and blood cholesterol&#8208;lowering activity. Another related subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o&#8208;aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o&#8208;aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso&#8208;forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL&#8208;24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.

         <title>Tuning Multi&#8208;Active Sites in Cu Catalyst via Ag/Ni Doping for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites can effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, ultimately achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) for the synthesis of C2+ products.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to C2+ products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites could effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C2+ products. In situ measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated that by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalysts, the electronic structure and the local *CO coverage on the Cu surface could be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C2+ pathway. In particular, Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi DNPs) could more effectively reduce the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling than Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with phase&#8208;separated multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi PNPs). As a result, the Cu40AgNi DNPs catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites yielded C2+ products with a FE of 93.2% and a current density up to 818.1 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.38&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), which are higher than most reported up to date for C2+ production. This work provides a methodology for designing robust multi&#8208;metallic ECR catalysts with tailored multi&#8208;active site configurations.

     alt="Tuning Multi-Active Sites in Cu Catalyst via Ag/Ni Doping for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating Cu-Ag-Ni multi-metal sites can effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, ultimately achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) for the synthesis of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu-Ag-Ni multi-metal sites could effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products. In situ measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated that by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu-Ag-Ni catalysts, the electronic structure and the local *CO coverage on the Cu surface could be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; pathway. In particular, Cu-Ag-Ni catalyst with dispersed multi-sites (Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;AgNi DNPs) could more effectively reduce the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling than Cu-Ag-Ni catalyst with phase-separated multi-sites (Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;AgNi PNPs). As a result, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;AgNi DNPs catalyst with dispersed multi-sites yielded C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products with a FE of 93.2% and a current density up to 818.1 mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.38&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), which are higher than most reported up to date for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; production. This work provides a methodology for designing robust multi-metallic ECR catalysts with tailored multi-active site configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we reveal the crucial role of crystallography in high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes. Unlike the belief that radial architecture's preferential texture enhances performance, we show it alters misorientation distribution by increasing low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. This reduces chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation, improving Li+ diffusion and ultimately enhancing rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes.








Abstract
Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8211;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li+ diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. Although a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecture primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li+ diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li+ diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.

         <title>Nanoconfined Ultrathin Polymer Membrane for Ultrafast Separation of Biobutanol from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging dissolution&#8211;crosslinking competition of linear polymer during an interfacial cross&#8208;linking reaction, a sub&#8208;10 nm thick polymer membrane was fabricated and precisely confined within the permanent voids of alumina supporting nanolayer. Through this nanoconfined ultrathin polymer membrane, 1.0&#160;wt% of aqueous n&#8208;butanol can be concentrated 14.2&#8208;fold, with a record&#8208;breaking liquid flux of 110&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Efficient recovery of biobutanol, a next&#8208;generation biofuel, from fermentation liquor remains challenging due to its low concentration and volatility. This study introduces ultrathin rubbery polymer membranes developed through an interfacial dissolution&#8211;crosslinking method, with cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane confined within the permanent nanovoids of ceramic alumina substrates. The resulting membranes, which are less than 10&#160;nm thick, achieve unparalleled performance: concentrating 1.0&#160;wt% aqueous n&#8208;butanol 14.2&#8208;fold with a record&#8208;high liquid flux of 110&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#8212;one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of previously reported membranes. These advancements suggest significant reductions in the membrane area and operational costs for large&#8208;scale biobutanol separation, establishing a sustainable and economical solution for biofuel production.

         <title>Adaptive Defluoroamination of Aryl Fluorides: Harnessing the Catalytic Potential of a Unique Zinc Amide Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed an effective and adaptable catalytic protocol for the radical&#8208;mediated defluoroamination of fluoroarenes, utilizing a redox&#8208;active amide ligand&#8208;supported zinc(II) compound. Intriguingly, this accommodative protocol offers several advantages, e.g., the mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope (covering most types of fluoroarenes and diverse N&#8208;nucleophiles) with excellent functional group tolerance, selective C&#9472;F bond functionalization, and access to tertiary aryl amines in one&#8208;pot manner starting from the primary amine itself via double C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
The activation and functionalization of C&#9472;F bonds, the strongest bonds between carbon and any other element, via C&#9472;N bond formation to generate complex molecules has remained a compelling challenge. Herein, we present a ligand&#8208;centered redox&#8208;controlled effective strategy employing a zinc amide catalyst (C) to achieve facile defluoroamination of fluoroarenes with several N&#8208;nucleophiles (&gt;90 substrates) under mild conditions. Notably, this adaptable protocol works readily with most types of fluoroarenes and a diverse range of N&#9472;H moieties that include secondary and primary amines, indoles, azoles, and&#160;amides under the same reaction conditions and encouragingly offers excellent functional group compatibility. Intriguingly, we also demonstrated its application in one&#8208;pot synthesis of (un)symmetrical triaryl amines from primary amine itself and the selective activation of C&#9472;F bonds to access F&#8208;containing amines, relevant to drug synthesis. Finally, detailed mechanistic probes via active&#8208;intermediate&#8208;capture, EPR analysis, and various control experiments indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical&#8208;mediated C&#9472;N coupling pathway. Importantly, use of Zn(II) center as a template to hold the two amide moieties together in C enables facile intramolecular electron transfer to generate the radical intermediates for the present protocol. Finally, the practical utility of this methodology was&#160;showcased by synthesizing various drug derivatives.

         <title>Catching Fullerenes: Synthesis of Molecular Nanogloves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose the synthesis of curved cavitands. The efficient and straightforward hybridization of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene results in well&#8208;defined rigid receptors capable of capturing fullerenes with high affinity. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a new series of rigid, all meta&#8208;phenylene, conjugated deep&#8208;cavity molecules, displaying high binding affinity towards buckyballs. A facile synthetic approach with an overall combined yield of approximately 53% in the last two steps has been developed using a templating strategy that combines the general structure of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene. These two moieties are covalently linked via four acetal bonds, resulting in a glove&#8208;like architecture. 1H NMR titration experiments reveal fullerene binding affinities (Ka) exceeding &#8805;106&#160;M&#8722;1. The size complementarity between fullerenes and these scaffolds maximizes CH&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions, and their host:guest adduct resembles a ball in a glove, hence their name as nanogloves. Fullerene recognition is tested by suspending carbon soot in a solution of nanoglove in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane, where more than a dozen fullerenes are observed, ranging from C60 to C96.

Fullerene recognition is tested by suspending carbon soot in a solution of nanoglove in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, where more than a dozen fullerenes are observed, ranging from C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first total syntheses of rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;Wallichanol A, (&#8208;)&#8208;Sanguinolane, and (&#8208;)&#8208;Wallichanol B were accomplished via a concise sequence featuring an intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition to forge a unique tricyclo[3.3.1.02,&#8311;]nonane core. Key steps include a selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reduction, Robinson annulation, and aerobic oxidations to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of three rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids, (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol A (1), (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol B (2), and (&#8211;)&#8208;Sanguinolane (3), using a 13, 17, and 14 step longest&#8208;linear sequences respectively, featuring a novel intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition to construct the unique pentacyclic framework containing an unprecedented tricyclo[3.3.1.02,7]nonane motif. Other key steps in the synthetic route include a highly challenging, selective alkene reduction via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leveraging the thermodynamic preference for a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical; a Robinson&#8208;type annulation to construct the tricyclic terpenoid building block; and applying aerobic oxidation at two distinct points to form &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, facilitating the enantioselective syntheses of these diterpenoids.

         <title>S&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced &#8220;Proton Fence Effect&#8221; Enables Selectivity Switching between CH4 and CO in Photo&#8208;Assisted CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective switching of C1 product between CH4 and CO during photo&#8208;assisted CO2 electroreduction is realized by a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; effect resulting from sulfur vacancies (SV). CO2 undergoes complete hydrogenation to CH4 (93.6% FE) over CuInS2/CuS stabilized by photo&#8208;generated holes, while *OH anchored on Sv of CuInS2/CuS1&#8208;x hinders local proton migration with preferential *CO desorption, exclusively furnishing CO (95.3% FE).








Abstract
Upcycling CO2 into high&#8208;value C1 products is impressive for achieving carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, while rational modulation of C1 product selectivity is one of the biggest challenges in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) due to the competing reaction pathways and thermodynamic limitation. Here, we showcase a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; strategy enabled by in situ adsorbed *OH on sulfur vacancies (SV) to ultraselectively switch the C1 product between CH4 and CO during CO2RR, with Faraday efficiency of 93.6% and 95.3%, respectively. In situ measurements uncover that the photo&#8208;generated holes counteract Cu2+ electroreduction to retain the intact structure of CuInS2/CuS, while *OH dissociated from water can spontaneously anchor toward SV to hinder the local proton migration, completely circumventing multiproton products. Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH&#8208;anchored SV renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of SV, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH4. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO2RR, and the photo&#8208;assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron&#8208;intolerant catalytic structures.

Three homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2 were synthesized.

Abstract
Structural transformation of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters is of significant interest because of its relevance to the formation mechanisms and stability of metal clusters. Herein, we report three large homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2, synthesized from the same precursor 2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;CAg via fine&#8208;tuning the reduction rate. X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that Ino decahedral Ag13 units serve as building blocks in all three nanoclusters. Remarkably, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster transformation in methanol. It initially converts into Ag74, then Ag74 reacts with Ag98 to form Ag86, which eventually is transformed into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. Time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) confirms such a multi&#8208;step reaction process during the transformation, identifying Ag86 as the key intermediate. Our findings not only provide new insights into the structural transformation pathways of nanoclusters but also enhance the understanding of transformation mechanisms, contributing to the rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters.

         <title>A Programmable Nanoparticle Conversion Pathway to Monodisperse Polyelemental High Entropy Alloy, Intermetallic, and Multiphase Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelemental nanoparticles, composed of four or more elements, encompass high&#8208;entropy alloys, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics, and multiphase structures such as Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. These nanoparticles were obtained through the thermal transformation of colloidally synthesized core&#8208;shell nanoparticles. Systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity of the precursor nanoparticles, combined with atomistic simulations evaluating phase stability, reveal that the final mixing states of these nanoparticles are dictated by the interplay between enthalpy and entropy of mixing.








Abstract
Polyelemental nanoparticles (PE NPs), those consisting of four or more elements, exhibit unique properties from synergistic compositional effects. Examples include high entropy alloys, high entropy intermetallics, and multiphase types, including Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. Although colloidal syntheses offer excellent structural control for mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;elemental compositions, achieving the same control for PE NPs remains challenging. Here, this challenge is addressed with a NP conversion strategy wherein different types of PE NPs &#8211; including high entropy alloy, high entropy intermetallic, and multiphase Janus nanoparticles &#8211; are achieved through thermal transformation of readily synthesized colloidal core&#8208;shell NPs. Through systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity to the core&#8208;shell precursor NPs, along with atomistic simulations that probe phase stabilities, we deduce that the final mixing states of the various NPs are governed by the balance between the enthalpy and entropy of mixing. Moreover, our annealing method allows us to trap NPs at intermediate states of mixing, creating distinct surface ensembles that were evaluated as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report colloidally derived precursor NPs enabling the synthesis of all types of PE NPs in a single process. This NP conversion strategy offers a general route to diverse PE NPs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Photosensitizing Cobalt Complexes for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled with CH3OH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Self&#8208;photosensitizing non&#8208;noble metal complexes achieve CO2 photoreduction coupled with CH3OH photooxidation, simultaneously synthesizing formic acid in the absence of any additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants.








Abstract
The use of metal complexes as homogeneous molecular catalysts has attracted considerable attention regarding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Enhancing these complexes with photosensitivity and photooxidation capabilities, aiming to create multifunctional molecular devices, presents significant challenges. In response to these challenges, we successfully designed and synthesized three innovative metal complexes. The complexes demonstrate a remarkable ability to perform CO2 photoreduction in tandem with methanol photooxidation, allowing for the simultaneous production of formic acid without requiring additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants. An optimal turnover number (TON) value of 855 was obtained under simulated sunlight. Even under natural sunlight, the TON can reach 207, much higher than the value of the physical mixture of the photocatalytic reductive and oxidative moieties. Spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that integrating reduction and oxidation sites in one molecular catalyst can promote charge transfer kinetics and enhance activity for CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation. This is the first report that non&#8208;noble metal homogeneous catalysts can simultaneously possess photosensitivity, photoreduction, and photo&#8208;oxidation functions, offering new insights into designing homogeneous catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Front Cover: Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction over Cu (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysis is governed by elusive, dynamic interfacial processes. In their Research Article (e202423177), Charlotte Vogt and co&#8208;workers introduce dynamic response spectroscopy (DRS) to isolate time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic features of the electric double layer during CO2 electroreduction over copper. This method reveals discrete restructuring events and water dynamics correlated with CO2 turnover, offering a new paradigm for probing electrochemical interfaces (Cover design: Thomas Hartman).

Enzyme specificity defines function: aminophenol oxidase uniquely converts aminophenols into nitrosophenols, whereas tyrosinase transforms them into quinone imines. This distinction is governed by a key amino acid near the copper(A) active site. In their Research Article (e202501560), Annette Rompel et&#160;al. demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange&#8212;swapping asparagine in SgGriF with isoleucine in SzTYR&#8212;can effectively invert the enzymes&#8217; functions.

A single&#8208;molecule liposome assay for membrane permeabilization using confocal microscopy paired with a fast&#8208;flow microfluidics device is reported by Scott L. Cockroft, Mathew H. Horrocks et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503678). Liposomes, encapsulating calcium&#8208;sensitive dye, pass through the channel aligned with the microscope. Membrane&#8208;permeabilizing agents allow calcium influx, sensitizing the dye which is detected as the liposome passes through the confocal volume. As successive liposomes pass through the volume, signals acquired indicate the permeabilising properties of the analyte.

Changes in electrode surface chemistry under electrochemical conditions critically influence electrocatalytic performance. In their Communication (e202500965), Julia Kunze&#8208;Liebh&#228;user et al. employed in&#8208;situ electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor the surface state of tungsten carbide (WC) powder electrodes during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and at oxidative potentials. Upon electrochemical polarization, the ubiquitous oxide layer dissolves, which causes exposure of the catalytically active carbide surface under HER conditions.

         <title>Functional SELEX and Biomedical Applications of Aptamers: Beyond Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the limitations of traditional aptamer selection methods, which often ignore functional performance in biological contexts. Functional SELEX now selects aptamers with both high specificity and biological activity (F&#8208;aptamers), making them valuable for therapy and cellular regulation. This minireview further highlights advances, challenges, and opportunities in F&#8208;aptamer research, emphasizing the transformative potential of F&#8208;aptamers in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers, developed through SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), are generally short oligonucleotide molecules with remarkable specificity and binding affinity to diverse biological targets. These molecules have shown promise across such fields as biosensing, molecular diagnostics, and bioimaging. However, while conventional aptamer selection strategies predominantly emphasize binding affinity, they overlook the broader spectrum of potential biological functionalities. This oversight results in aptamers that frequently exhibit limited capacity for direct biological regulation. This inherent limitation in the selection process significantly constrains both the widespread application of aptamers across diverse fields and their therapeutic potential as direct drug candidates. Functional SELEX represents an advancement by refining selection library construction and selection processes to create F&#8208;aptamers that integrate precise molecular recognition with specific biological activities. F&#8208;aptamers hold transformative potential as therapeutic agents, diagnostic tools, and molecular regulators, marking a significant step forward in biomedical applications. This minireview critically assesses recent developments in F&#8208;aptamer SELEX strategies, addressing challenges, and exploring opportunities for future research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Polymer Delivery Platforms for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the molecular and vector design strategies, and responsive mechanisms of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, covering pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), enzymes, hypoxia, and dual/multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive vectors. In parallel, it also provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms for drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Furthermore, the review discusses the current challenges and future directions in the field, offering feasible insights for the development of next&#8208;generation TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.








Abstract
Most chemotherapeutic and bioimaging agents struggle with inadequate bioavailability, primarily due to their limited biocompatibility and lack of specificity in targeting, leading to low or decreased anticancer efficacy and inaccurate imaging. To surmount these obstacles, the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, predominantly leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME), has emerged as a promising strategy. Therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be released controllably at the tumor site by virtue of the bond cleavage or hydrophobic to hydrophilic transformation of TME&#8208;sensitive linkages in TME&#8208;responsive systems, thus augmenting cancer treatment and imaging precision, while simultaneously attenuating the damage to healthy tissues and false imaging signals caused by non&#8208;specific drug leakage. In this comprehensive review, we scrutinize recent studies of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, encompassing pH&#8208;, ROS&#8208;, GSH&#8208;, enzyme&#8208;, and hypoxia&#8208;responsive vectors, significantly from the perspective of their molecular design and responsive mechanism, and further summarizing their bio&#8208;application in drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, this review encapsulates the critical challenges and offers an insightful perspective on the future prospects of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.

         <title>Tuning Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters for Selective Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a summary of the structure&#8211;property relationship of atomically precise gold nanoclusters and their application in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. It delves into the underlying mechanisms of CO2 reduction process and identifies the key factors influencing the performance of these nanoclusters. Furthermore, future research directions are discussed to improve efficiency and expand the diversity of multicarbon products from CO&#8322; reduction using gold nanoclusters.








Abstract
The electroreduction of greenhouse gas CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising way to mitigate climate change and realize carbon cycling. Atomically precise thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters have shown great potential for selective electrochemical conversion of CO2 toward CO due to their quantum confinement effect and unique electronic structures. Additionally, the atomic precision of gold nanocluster is advantageous for investigating the CO2 reduction mechanism, which is typically challenging to understand due to the complexity of the catalytic interface, and unknown structure of the active site in more conventional catalysts. By summarizing CO2 reduction catalyzed by gold nanoclusters, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to the activity, selectivity, and stability of nanocluster catalysts, as well as elucidate the CO&#8322; reduction pathway, thereby contributing to the design of more active and selective nanocluster catalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sequence Control in Sulphur&#8208;Containing Ring&#8208;Opening Co&#8208; and Terpolymerisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulphur&#8208;containing polymers offer unique avenues for degradability, recyclability and optical performance&#8212;but their synthesis is often plagued by side reactions. This minireview outlines recent strategies to control or harness O/S scrambling in ring&#8208;opening co&#8208; and terpolymerisations, enabling precise sequence control. Emerging applications in dynamic materials, self&#8208;assembly, and sustainable plastics are highlighted. 








Abstract
Sulphur&#8208;containing polymers uniquely expand the catalogue of accessible material properties compared to current commodity materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped. Combining sulphur&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing monomers in ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation leads to a reshuffling reaction of the sulphur centres, which has been challenging to control &#8212; a central task for reliably tailoring properties. However, very recent methodologies have emerged that not only suppress but also utilise this phenomenon to precisely access sulphur&#8208;containing polymer structures. These structures can exhibit improved degradability, chemical recyclability, refractive indices and crystallinity compared to their all&#8208;oxygen analogues. Furthermore, underutilised and even entirely untapped monomer feedstocks can become accessible as a result. This minireview aims to provide a roadmap of the tools currently available to selectively access sulphur&#8208;containing co&#8208; and terpolymer structures to enable emerging applications that leverage the chemistry of sulphur.

&lt;p&gt;Sulphur-containing polymers offer unique avenues for degradability, recyclability and optical performance&#8212;but their synthesis is often plagued by side reactions. This minireview outlines recent strategies to control or harness O/S scrambling in ring-opening co- and terpolymerisations, enabling precise sequence control. Emerging applications in dynamic materials, self-assembly, and sustainable plastics are highlighted.

         <title>Exploring the Interplay of Lattice Dynamics and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Progress Toward Rational Phonon Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights recent advances in understanding the role of lattice dynamics and electron&#8211;phonon coupling in organic semiconductors. Emphasis is placed on mode&#8208;resolved insights into dynamics&#8208;induced electronic disorder, emerging strategies for phonon engineering, and the implications of both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrations on charge transport.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential use in flexible, lightweight, and cost&#8208;effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure&#8212;termed dynamic disorder&#8212;that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low&#8208;frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad range of phonons&#160; drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance. In this review, we explore progress toward uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode&#8208;resolved analyses of electron&#8211;phonon interactions lends toward the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design. This work offers an overview of the insight gained toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing charge transport in OSCs and outlines pathways for enhancing performance via targeted manipulation of interatomic/intermolecular interactions and resulting phonon&#160;modes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Disruption of 1D Wire&#8208;Like Arrays of Monoatomic Ag(I) Ions: Single&#8208;Crystal Reaction with Crystal Softening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

An Ag(I)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic crystal featuring 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies undergoes UV&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodimerization, transforming periodic metal arrays into dimers, creating voids, and decreasing crystal stiffness.








Abstract
The exploitation of noncovalent bonding in the solid state is attractive to generate one&#8208;dimensional (1D) wire&#8208;like assemblies of metals and uncover dynamic and physical properties of such intriguing structures. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;organic crystal based on Ag(I) ions that assemble to be organized into 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies maintained by argentophilic interactions. UV&#8208;light irradiation of the crystal composed of the 1D structures results in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization that transforms the 1D periodic metal arrays to isolated metal dimers. The structural reconfiguration creates small voids in the crystal and the resulting solids exhibit a substantial increase in softness up to 60%.

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208;Promoted Decomposition of Cysteine Ester (ITPDC): A General Platform for Controllable Release of Reactive Sulfur Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive sulfur species (RSS) are important endogenous molecules relevant to human health, but general approaches for the controllable release of distinct RSS are still lacking. In this work, we report a well&#8208;defined and safety donation platform for developing triggered RSS donors with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4. This work should extend the applicable chemical space for RSS delivery and research.








Abstract
Endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS) play critical roles in various physiological processes. RSS donors can enhance our understanding of RSS chemical biology and open new avenues for treating RSS&#8208;associated diseases. Nevertheless, general strategies for the controllable release of distinct RSS remain lacking. Herein, we present the first general platform for controllable release of RSS with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4, based on the intramolecular thiol&#8208;promoted decomposition of cysteine ester (ITPDC). We first rationally designed ITPDC&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors that avoid electrophilic byproducts and exhibit high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;50%). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations elucidated the detailed pathways of pH&#8208;controllable H2S release from ITPDC, and computational studies also predicted other H2S&#8208;related RSS release from the ITPDC&#8208;based motifs. Importantly, we developed a series of ITPDC&#8208;based donors capable of releasing various RSS, including persulfide, hydrogen persulfide, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Moreover, fluorescent imaging demonstrated the successful cellular delivery of H2S, persulfide, and SO2 from these donors, and the ITPDC&#8208;based motif was employed to create a light&#8208;triggered donor. We anticipate that these innovative chemistries will provide valuable tools for studying sulfur biology and for developing new RSS donors and bio&#8208;orthogonal cleavage techniques.

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Temporal Processes of Diffusion&#8208;Controlled Communication in Hierarchical Multi&#8208;Compartments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the molecular communication of neighboring biomimetic populations in pH&#8208;responsive hierarchically and non&#8208;covalently organized multi&#8208;compartments (HMC) through the assembly of micro&#8208; and nanocompartments. HMC unify key roles for cyclic spatio&#8208;temporal diffusion processes and spatio&#8208;temporal enzyme(&#8208;like) reactions.








Abstract
Exploring the synergy of feedback behavior and molecular communication between micro&#8208; and nanocompartments is of great implication for the development of advanced hierarchical living&#8208;like materials. Non&#8208;covalent interactions are the driving forces for dynamic and temporal events in biomimetic structures. Herein, pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical multi&#8208;compartments (HMC) are constructed via hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between azobenzene units and phospholipid layers through the integration of two distinct structural units: phospholipid&#8208;membranized coacervates (Coa@DMPC) and azobenzene&#8208;functionalized polymersomes (Azo&#8208;Psomes). This enables us to study spatio&#8208;temporal signal pathways for biomimetic pH homeostasis and the triggering of feedback&#8208;controlled peroxidase&#8208;like behavior of Azo&#8208;Psomes within HMC. Compared with undocking systems, the information transmission process within HMC shows a high efficiency. Besides the continuous addition of nutrients, the synchronization of two different biomimetic reactions in HMC requires the spatial loading of glucose oxidase and L&#8208;phenylalanine ammonia lyase in coacervates and of L&#8208;phenylalanine or beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Azo&#8208;Psomes exhibit pH&#8208;responsive feedback&#8208;controlled behavior. The pH&#8208;responsive membrane of Azo&#8208;Psomes is responsible for the spatio&#8208;temporal peroxidase&#8208;like activity of lumen&#8208;integrated beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Finally, this strategy provides a new approach for constructing more complex biomimetic systems by interconnecting at least two membrane&#8208;containing compartments to further explore the synergistic mechanisms and feedback behaviors among artificial cell communities.

&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the molecular communication of neighboring biomimetic populations in pH-responsive hierarchically and non-covalently organized multi-compartments (HMC) through the assembly of micro- and nanocompartments. HMC unify key roles for cyclic spatio-temporal diffusion processes and spatio-temporal enzyme(-like) reactions.

         <title>Engineered Biocatalyst for Enantioselective Hydrazone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the discovery and engineering of a hydrazone reductase (HRED) biocatalyst that promotes efficient reduction of protected hydrazones with exceptional stereocontrol. These biotransformations offer a sustainable strategy for synthesizing valuable chiral N&#9472;N containing products that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.








Abstract
Enantioselective reduction of hydrazones provides a convergent and versatile route to synthesize hydrazine&#8208;containing motifs that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, current methods require the use of precious metals, costly chiral ligands, and/or forcing reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a biocatalytic approach for enantioselective hydrazone reduction using engineered imine reductases. Following evaluation of an in&#8208;house panel of &gt;400 IRED sequences, we identified a single IR361 I127F L179V variant that promotes reduction of Cbz&#8208;protected hydrazones. The introduction of additional two mutations via directed evolution afforded HRED1.1 that is 20&#8208;fold more active than the parent template and promotes reduction of a variety of protected hydrazones in high yields and selectivities (&gt;99% e.e.), including in preparative scale biotransformations. Structural analysis of HRED1.1 provides insights into the origins of its unique hydrazone reductase activity. This study offers a powerful biocatalytic route to synthesize valuable chiral hydrazine products and further expands the impressive range of transformations accessible with engineered imine reductases.

         <title>Luminescent Detection of Photomagnetic Effect in a Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Neodymium(III)&#8211;Octacyanidotungstate(IV) Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic neodymium(III)&#8211;tungsten(IV) layered cyanido&#8208;bridged framework combines 4f&#8208;metal&#8208;centered near&#8208;infrared emission with a thermally reversible octacyanidotungstate(IV)&#8208;based photomagnetic response. As a result, it exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescent read&#8208;out of photo&#8208;induced changes in magnetization relying on the ratio between two selected peaks of excitation spectra and their temperature dependence.








Abstract
Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin transition materials, including spin&#8208;crossover complexes, and can lead to long&#8208;range magnetic ordering. Photo&#8208;induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin&#8208;crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not yet explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic NdIII&#8211;[WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and rationalize theoretically near&#8208;infrared emission of NdIII centers sensitized by [WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd3+ excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light&#8208;induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read&#8208;out.

         <title>Mesoporous Enhanced Heterostructured Halide Solid Electrolytes with High Air Stability and High Abundance for Sustainable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NaCl&#8208;based solid electrolyte reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 is introduced. This heterostructure halide electrolyte effectively balances the ion conductivity and air stability, with a high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding conversion&#8208;type Na//FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Chlorides and fluorides solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) exhibit contrasting extremes in ionic conductivity and moisture sensitivity. In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl&#8208;based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 (denoted as HS&#8208;AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS&#8208;AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS&#8208;AlF3 during mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F&#8208;Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote Na ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves the high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long&#8208;term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. The conversion&#8208;type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1. This work opens the new pathways for inorganic SEs with enhanced economic value, ion conductivity, air stability and suitability for energy&#8208;dense conversion reaction batteries.

Enantioselective abiotic synthesis of ribose was found to be catalyzed by hydroxyapatite endowed with helically lattice&#8208;distorted chiral mesostructure. Ribose with a significant d&#8208;enantiomeric excess was synthesized on the right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite nanorods due to its enantiomeric adsorption selectivity, which provides new insights and potential evidence supporting the &#8220;RNA world&#8221; hypothesis on the origin of life.








Abstract
The prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose are crucial processes in the origin of life. However, the prebiotic emergence of enantiomerically enriched ribose on primitive Earth remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we propose that the prebiotic enantioselective synthesis of ribose from glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde can be catalyzed by minerals naturally endowed with chiral structure. The chiral mesostructured hydroxyapatite films (CMHAPFs), which consist of lattice&#8208;distorted helical nanorods, can be formed under a hydrothermal condition in the presence of l/d&#8208;malic acid (MA), a compound that may have been present during the early stages of life's emergence. An enantiomeric excess (ee) of 22.5% for d&#8208;ribose was achieved on the d&#8208;CMHAPFs formed by d&#8208;MA. The adsorption conformation of d&#8208;ribose on the surface of right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite is more stable than that of l&#8208;ribose. The different energy barriers for the transition states of ribose enantiomers result in the enantioselective synthesis of ribose, which is attributed to the similar conformation between ribose and the corresponding transition state. Our findings provide valuable insights into the possible role of chiral inorganics in the prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose.

         <title>In Quest of Chemical Probes for DNA Methylation Reader Proteins: Nucleoside and Dimer Analogues of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine Interact with MBD2</title>

Design and convergent synthesis of 5mC, 5mdC and 5mCpG mimics to interact with MBD2 reader protein and disrupt the DNA/MBD2 interaction. NMR studies confirm compound binding at the DNA/MBD2 interface, highlighting the advantage of l&#8208;configuration of 5mdC.








Abstract
DNA methylation modulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns characterise a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, and serve as validated therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Among the proteins involved in DNA methylation regulation, the human reader methyl&#8208;CpG binding domain 2 protein (MBD2) exhibits a strong preference for methylated DNA and initiates signalling cascades predominantly resulting in gene repression. The full description of this mechanism is still to be elucidated. Here, we developed original chemical compounds to interfere with MBD2 and its interaction with DNA. Through convergent chemical pathways, we modified 5&#8208;methylcytosine at position N4 and synthesised the corresponding deoxynucleosides and CpG dimers. We tested 70 compounds in two screening assays to assess their interaction with MBD2 and their ability to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex. Remarkably, substituting modified nucleobases into CpG dimers significantly boosted the biological activity. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the configuration (d/l) of the modified nucleosides and identified four dimers (5d, 7e, 15e and 16e) able to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex, highlighting the advantage of the l&#8208;configuration. Importantly, NMR experiments confirmed their interaction with amino acids of MBD2 involved in methylated DNA binding.

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNA Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine SNAP&#8208;Tag Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNAPR is a ribozyme that repurposes O6&#8208;benzylguanine SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA with bioorthogonal alkyne and azide functional groups, fluorophores or photocrosslinkers. The N1A&#8208;alkylated RNA products were converted to N6A&#8208;modified RNA by Dimroth rearrangement. RNA&#8208;catalyzed fluorescent labeling was shown for tRNA, and protein&#8211;RNA photocrosslinking was demonstrated for an m6A reader protein.








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of RNAs with functional handles enables studies of RNA structure, fate, function, and interactions. Ribozymes provide an elegant way to covalently modify RNA of interest (ROI). Here, we report that the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 can be employed as a versatile tool for RNA modification and labeling. Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine cofactors, designed in analogy to SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for protein labeling, MTR1 installs various bioorthogonal functional groups at N1 of a specific adenosine in the RNA target. In this application of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA labeling, MTR1 is now called SNAPR. In contrast to the self&#8208;labeling SNAP&#8208;tag, which is appended to the protein of interest, SNAPR is a truly intermolecular RNA catalyst (active in trans). SNAPR assembles with the ROI to the active ribozyme, allowing for the transfer of clickable tags, such as azide and alkyne moieties, as well as photolabile groups or cross&#8208;linkers from the guanine cofactor to the ROI. Moreover, we demonstrate a two&#8208;step approach to attach labels at N6 of the target adenosine: first, SNAPR generates N1A&#8208;modified RNA, followed by preparative Dimroth rearrangement to produce N6A&#8208;modified RNA. We demonstrate this strategy with p&#8208;azidobenzyl groups as photocrosslinker to generate covalent RNA&#8211;protein conjugates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox for site&#8208;specific RNA modification.

         <title>Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12: A Geometrically Closed, but Electronically Open Triple&#8208;Shell Icosahedral Gold Cluster and its Geometrically Open Counterpart</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first triple&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12, is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates but does not show stable motifs. This cluster fills the gap between single&#8208;shell clusters and nanoparticles in the form of an icosahedron. This geometrically closed but electronically open cluster co&#8208;crystallizes with an Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)12 cluster, which is in contrast geometrically open but electronically closed. Both clusters provide a unique view of the transition between molecules and nanoparticles.








Abstract
The aesthetic platonic solids have been known since ancient times, and the structure of all five platonic solids is also found in chemical compounds. While gold sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and gold nanoparticles with an icosahedral structure have been known for a long time to exist, a multi&#8208;shell icosahedral gold cluster at the intermediate size between 13 and thousands of atoms has been elusive. Here we present the synthesis and crystallographic characterization of the first triple&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12 1. The gold core in 1 is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates, but surprisingly no staple motifs are formed. A second cluster, Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)12 2, cocrystallizes and is identified as having a closed electronic shell but can be considered as a geometrically open pendant of 1. The unique clusters are characterized experimentally by EDX, UV/vis, DLS, and EPR and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>A C&#8211;H Arylation&#8208;Based Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the synthesis of planar chiral macrocyclophanes via Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation is reported. It relies on the design of new bifunctional ligands showing optimal noncovalent interactions with the substrate, and involves the dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile precursors. The obtained macrocyclophanes show interesting chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Despite the growing importance of planar chiral macrocyclophanes owing to their unique properties in different areas of chemistry, methods that are effective in controlling their planar chirality are restricted to certain molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report the first Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation that induces planar chirality by installing bulky aryl groups through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). A computer&#8208;assisted approach allowed a fine&#8208;tuning of the structure of the employed chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands to achieve high enantioselectivities. A range of planar chiral macrocyclophanes were successfully synthesized from configurationally labile macrocyclic precursors via C&#8722;H arylation with various perfluoroarenes. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction proceeds via reversible oxidative addition and enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation. Selected macrocyclophane products showed interesting photophysical and chiroptical properties, which depended on both the nature of the ansa chains and the aromatic moieties.

         <title>Evaluation of Intermolecular Weak Binding Through the Zero&#8208;Field Splitting of an Endofullerene High&#8208;Spin Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron paramagnetic resonance approach was reported to reveal the weak binding in different types of supramolecular co&#8208;crystals of fullerene and porphyrin. The zero&#8208;field splitting effect of the high spin center turned out to be very sensitive to the small oblate and prolate distortion of the fullerene cage, showing that interaction between fullerenes and porphyrins followed the order of PtTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;PdTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;NiTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;ZnTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;H2TPP.








Abstract
Weak binding between molecules is becoming a renowned aspect of molecular engineering, offering an alternative to the tuning of conventional chemical bonds. However, the subtle nature of these interactions poses challenges for characterization using standard techniques. Herein, an efficient method of weak binding characterization based on the zero&#8208;field splitting of a high&#8208;spin probe by electron paramagnetic resonance is presented. Using endofullerene as the high spin center, we achieved direct comparison of the weak binding strengths in F&#8208;MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn, Ni, and Pd) and 2F&#8208;3MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Ni, Pd, and Pt) through the zero&#8208;field splitting parameters. The high&#8208;spin resonance spectrum is sensitive to the small variation in the supramolecular structure. By examining fullerene&#8211;porphyrin co&#8208;crystals with various metal centers and packing arrangements, the relation between intermolecular weak binding and microstructural strain on the fullerene cage is elucidated.

         <title>Thionated Perylenebisimides as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers: Intersystem Crossing, Electron Spin Dynamics, and Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the triplet state lifetime becomes shorter (ca. 0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) with thionation of the carbonyl groups in the PBI chromophore (ca. 127 &#181;s). Both theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra demonstrate the enhanced spin orbit coupling (SOC) upon thionation. Intersystem crossing was observed for dianion of the thionated PBIs, and the triplet state lifetime (18&#8211;85 &#181;s) are long, thus the photoexcited dianions with ISC ability can be used as strong electron donor (the oxidation potential is &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+) in photocatalytic redox organic reactions.








Abstract
The thionation induced intersystem crossing (ISC) in perylenebisimide (PBI) derivatives was studied. The triplet state lifetimes of the thionated PBIs are substantially shortened (0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) as compared to the unsubstituted PBI (ca. 130 &#181;s). Moreover, there is a clear trend of shortening of the triplet excited state lifetimes and the degree of thionation of the carbonyl groups in PBI. These findings rationalize the previous report of the contradictory lower 1O2 quantum yields for the PBI derivatives with more carbonyl groups thionated. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectral study shows that the zero field splitting parameters D (1625&#8211;1992&#160;MHz) of the lowest triplet states of thionated PBI are larger than that of the pristine PBI chromophore (D&#160;=&#160;1166&#160;MHz), which is attributed to the influence of sulfur atoms. Interestingly, the electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of the TREPR spectra is inverted at longer delay time. Importantly we observed ISC for the dianion of the thionated PBI derivatives, and photoexcited dianion species can be used as super strong reductant for photocatalysis with the advantage of long excited state lifetimes (18&#8211;85 &#181;s), and the excited state oxidation potentials are &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V (versus Fc/Fc+).

         <title>Uncovering the Photochemical Conversion of Atmospheric Chlorinated Organics on Mineral Dust: In&#8208;Field Evidence of a New Source of Dioxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining in&#8208;field experiment, laboratory simulations, and theoretical calculations, this work identifies a new pathway of photochemical conversion of atmospheric chlorinated organics into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans on mineral dust particulates, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial chlorinated organics and their secondary transformation particulates in the atmosphere.








Abstract
Hazardous chemicals are typically assessed based on their inherent toxicity, often neglecting the fact that their atmospheric secondary transformation products may exhibit increased toxicity and persistence, potentially exceeding the risks associated with the parent chemicals. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are a significant class of commercial chemicals, but their secondary conversion in the atmosphere remains largely unknown. Herein, by combining laboratory and in&#8208;field experiments, we have identified a new conversion pathway that the CVOCs can be photochemically transformed into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) on mineral dust particulates under atmospheric conditions. We showed that mineral components, particularly Fe&#8208; and Al&#8208;related oxides, can efficiently convert monochlorobenzene, dichloromethane, and perchloroethylene into PCDD/Fs under light irradiation. By combing reaction product measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 exhibited much higher propensity for dioxin formation than &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, as evidenced by its lower reaction energy barriers for both the initial phenol formation and subsequent chlorination processes. In particular, histopathological assays showed the photochemically&#8208;reacted &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 can cause severe damage to the lung and brain tissues of mice, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial CVOCs and their secondary transformation products.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as a catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active&#8208;learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results by comparing experimental and theoretical high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Filler with Anion&#8208;Constrained Centers in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work designed cationic imidazolium&#8208;based units to prepare PAF&#8208;142 containing anion&#8208;constrained centers and fast diffusion channels for Li+, thus facilitating the dissociation of Li+ and its rapid transport. The composite polymer electrolyte PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE, exhibited high Li+ conductivity and remarkable suppression of lithium dendrite formation, achieving excellent long cycle stability.








Abstract
The widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li+ conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE. The cationic imidazolium sites could effectively constrain the movement of anions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the design of the imidazolium&#8208;based building units allowed the cationic sites to be located within the framework, which promoted the transport of Li+. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which PAF&#8208;142 promoted the dissociation of lithium salts and enhanced Li+ transport. Benefiting from these advantages, the Li+ conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (QCPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE reached 8.77&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. Additionally, a stable interface with abundant inorganic components was formed between PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE and the lithium electrode, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, thereby achieving stable long cycle of the Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//Li cell for more than 8500&#160;h. The Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//LFP cell demonstrated excellent cycle life exceeding 1400 cycles. This study proposes a promising SPEs performance&#8208;enhancing solution, advancing cutting&#8208;edge lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters Through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydroheteroarylation of Cyclopentenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iridium catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#9472;H addition of diverse heterocycles including furan, benzofuran, thiophene, and indole to cyclic alkenes. This process occurs diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively, delivering enantioenriched cyclopentane structures containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary and 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;catalyzed direct addition of (hetero)aryl C&#9472;H bond to an alkene provides an expedited route to construct benzylic stereocenter from readily available arene and alkene feedstocks with complete atom&#8208;economy. However, creation of more than one stereocenter through enantioselective C&#9472;H (hetero)arylation remains a challenging goal. Here we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydroheteroarylation of cyclopentenes to construct 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. A series of heteroaryl C&#9472;H bonds were cleaved site&#8208;selectively and added regio&#8208; and enantioselectively to an unactivated alkene containing an amide coordinating group, delivering valuable enantioenriched cyclopentane scaffolds containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary or 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Based &#8220;Transfer Stations&#8221; at Carbon&#8208;Immobilized Metal Particles Enable Rapid Hydrogen Transfer for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct engineering of metal&#8208;solution interaction by &#9472;NH2 modified metal sites is demonstrated for boosting the formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an &#9472;NH2 modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production.








Abstract
The interaction of surface metal species with the solution plays a key role in engineering heterogeneous catalytic processes. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of L&#8208;histidine&#8208;coordinated PdAg nanoparticles (4.03&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08&#160;nm) anchored on pristine carbon supports (denoted as PdAg&#8208;NH2/C) and their use for formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). Significant acceleration of FAD related to the histidine is observed, and the enhancement mechanism is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The presence of L&#8208;histidine at metal sites promotes rapid binding of formic acid molecules due to acid&#8211;base interactions. The local enrichment of both protons and formate at the metal&#8208;solution interfaces promotes the subsequent formate decomposition and hydride transfer to the metal surface. The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an amino modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production. The optimal Pd1Ag1&#8208;NH2/C catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 6493.5&#160;h&#8722;1 at 333&#160;K based on the total amount of Pd, together with an H2 selectivity of 100%. This study emphasizes the critical role of optimizing local transport pathways near catalytic centers chemically and further provides insights into the rational development of heterogeneous catalysts for FAD technologies.

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer via Cerium Photocatalysis for Alkoxy Radical&#8208;Mediated Selective Hydroetherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct coupling of free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes&#8212;a longstanding challenge due to inherent polarity mismatches&#8212;is achieved via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform featuring cerium(IV) benzoate catalysts. This anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroetherification proceeds through selective activation of free alcohols into alkoxy radicals, facilitated by LMCT homolysis, even in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as enol ethers. Mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate complex, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation.








Abstract
We present a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform utilizing cerium(IV) benzoate complexes to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of directly coupling free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes, overcoming inherent polarity mismatches. This approach effectively circumvents the typical selectivity in single&#8208;electron transfer processes, enabling the selective generation of electrophilic alkoxy radicals from free alcohols in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The Ce&#8208;benzoate&#8208;based photocatalytic protocol promotes regioselective hydroetherification via both intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition pathways, showcasing broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and versatility across a diverse array of alkenes, including silyl enol ethers and enamides/enecarbamates.

     alt="Modulating Electron Transfer via Cerium Photocatalysis for Alkoxy Radical-Mediated Selective Hydroetherification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct coupling of free alcohols with electron-rich alkenes&#8212;a longstanding challenge due to inherent polarity mismatches&#8212;is achieved via a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)-enabled catalytic platform featuring cerium(IV) benzoate catalysts. This anti-Markovnikov hydroetherification proceeds through selective activation of free alcohols into alkoxy radicals, facilitated by LMCT homolysis, even in the presence of redox-labile electron-rich alkenes such as enol ethers. Mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate complex, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)-enabled catalytic platform utilizing cerium(IV) benzoate complexes to address the long-standing challenge of directly coupling free alcohols with electron-rich alkenes, overcoming inherent polarity mismatches. This approach effectively circumvents the typical selectivity in single-electron transfer processes, enabling the selective generation of electrophilic alkoxy radicals from free alcohols in the presence of redox-labile electron-rich alkenes. The Ce-benzoate-based photocatalytic protocol promotes regioselective hydroetherification via both intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition pathways, showcasing broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and versatility across a diverse array of alkenes, including silyl enol ethers and enamides/enecarbamates. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate catalyst, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation, thereby establishing a practical and atom-economical framework for hydroetherification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Strategy for Enhanced Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging Through Intramolecular Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging through the development of intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) cassettes, optimizing both photostability and photon budget. The cassettes, incorporating rhodamine as the donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as the acceptor, achieve an impressive 94.8% energy transfer efficiency and a 670% increase in survival time compared to rhodamine alone at the single&#8208;molecule level.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule imaging demands fluorophores with exceptional photostability and photon budget. This study presents an intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) strategy to enhance these critical properties. We developed xanthene&#8208;based IMET cassettes by covalently linking donor and acceptor, achieving significant improvements in single&#8208;molecule imaging performance. While extensive spectral overlap is generally beneficial in bulk systems, single&#8208;molecule imaging necessitates careful optimization to minimize direct acceptor excitation at the high excitation powers typically used. Our optimized cassettes, featuring rhodamine as donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as acceptor, exhibit 94.8% energy transfer efficiency. This configuration effectively minimizes direct excitation&#8208;induced acceptor bleaching, as 94.9% of molecules exhibit donor photobleaching prior to acceptor photobleaching. This efficient energy management leads to a 670% enhancement in photostability, arising from the competition between IMET and photobleaching pathways, which effectively channels excitation energy away from photo&#8208;destructive processes. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that IMET occurs on a picosecond timescale, significantly faster than both fluorescence relaxation (nanoseconds) and photobleaching (seconds). Notably, these IMET cassettes demonstrated superior performance in single&#8208;molecule tracking applications, including on supported lipid bilayers and in live&#8208;cell tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dynamics, highlighting the broad potential of the IMET strategy for advancing single&#8208;molecule imaging.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Mass Transfer Toward Industrial Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalytic process that bridges the inherent gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, thereby overcoming the barrier for the migration of reactant ions to catalytic sites. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH and formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated water electrolysis.








Abstract
The rapid migration of reactive ions across the electrolyte&#8211;catalytic sites interface is crucial in various catalytic processes. Herein, we introduce hydrogen bonds to bridge the intrinsic gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, mediating the diffusion of hydroxide ions. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH, wherein the oxygen atom within the oxyanions established hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules in the electrolyte. Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalysis. The sulfate&#8208;modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 H2 in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16&#160;000&#160;TWh.

         <title>Cyclization Polymerization of Elemental Sulfur and Diisocyanate: New Polymerization Toward High&#8208;Performance Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a new polymerization reaction, cyclization polymerization of aliphatic diisocyanate with elemental sulfur. It is the first report about directly converting elemental sulfur and isocyanate into a high&#8208;performance polymer. The polymer exhibits remarkably strong adhesion to a variety of substrates either in air or underwater.








Abstract
The development of polymer materials heavily relies on new polymerization reactions. Herein, we report the discovery of cyclization polymerization of element sulfur (S8) and aliphatic diisocyanate at room temperature with 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) organic base as the catalyst, where the two monomers are covalently linked via the formation of thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) or a cyclic isocyanurate ring. The polymer of S8 and 1,6&#8208;diisocyanatohexane (HDI) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Particularly, it has exceptionally high adhesion to various substrates in air or under water, e.g., the underwater adhesion strength is as high as &#8764;26.5&#160;MPa for poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and &#8764;2.3&#160;MPa for poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon). The cyclization polymerization provides the basis for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance polymers with elemental sulfur.

         <title>Mixing and Matching of Hybrid Megasynthases is a Hub for the Evolution of Metabolic Diversity in Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural combinatorics: Evolutionary mixing and matching of three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters resulted in the emergence of minutumamides, a novel family of peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids. Retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis led to the discovery of nostopeptolide KVJ3, an evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis and sheds light on cluster mixing as a widespread strategy in the evolution of metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Modular megasynthases, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), are molecular assembly lines that biosynthesize many pharmaceutically and ecologically important natural products. Understanding how these compounds evolve could inspire the artificial evolution of compound diversity by metabolic engineering. Over the past two decades, a number of seminal studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of natural product evolution. However, the evolution of NRPS and PKS assembly lines remains poorly understood, especially for NRPS/PKS hybrids. Here, we provide substantial evidence for a remarkable cluster&#8208;mixing event involving three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), resulting in the emergence of novel peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids that were named minutumamides. By combining retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis with structure&#8208;guided genome mining, we could discover a potential evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis. In addition, we were able to trace nostopeptolide&#8208;related module and domain blocks in various other biosynthetic pathways, indicating a surprisingly vivid mixing and matching of biosynthesis genes in the evolution of NRPS and cis&#8208;acyltransferase PKS/NRPS pathways, which was previously regarded as a unique feature of trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS. These remarkable insights into the evolutionary plasticity of NRPS&#8208;PKS assembly lines provide valuable guidance for pathway engineers looking for productive combinations that yield &#8220;nonnatural&#8221; hybrid natural products.

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts proceeds through electron injection into the &#960;* orbital, triggered by the hydrogenation of pyridinic nitrogen. By closely tracking the changes in the electronic state during the reaction, we have reported that the decrease in ORR activity in acidic electrolytes is due to the protonation of pyridinic nitrogen, which precedes its hydrogenation.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing on the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. Although this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing and Interfacial Contact via Halogenated N&#8208;Glycidyl Carbazole Small Molecules for Low Energy Loss and Highly Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;based small molecules with different halogen atoms not only reduced the carrier transport energy barrier and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss through self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions, but also regulated perovskite crystal growth, providing a minimal energy barrier of 0.10&#160;eV, an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%, and an exceptional power conversion efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%).








Abstract
Nonideal interfacial contact and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) limit their further development. Herein, two carbazole&#8208;based molecules with different halogen atoms (X&#8208;OCZ, X = Cl or Br) are developed as efficient interfacial regulators. The halogen effect not only finely modulates the molecular packing, crystallinity, and surface contact potential of the MeO&#8208;2PACz analogue via self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions but also significantly influences the subsequent crystal growth of perovskite, thus resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity, improved energy level alignment, and depressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Importantly, the Cl&#8208;OCZ&#8208;mediated device exhibits a minimal interfacial carrier transport energy barrier of 0.10&#160;eV and an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%. Moreover, the target device (aperture area: 0.09 cm2) shows an exceptional efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%) along with enhanced thermal and operational stability. The strategy is also extended to large area devices, delivering efficiencies of 25.0% for a 1&#160;cm2 device and 22.9% for a 12.96&#160;cm2 minimodule. This study highlights the halogen role of interfacial small molecules in optimizing molecular packing and interfacial contact toward highly efficient PSCs with minimized energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination.

         <title>An Autonomously Liquefied Hydrogel Adhesive for Programmable Bioelectronic Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present transient hydrogel adhesives driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface, which collects high&#8208;quality electrophysiological signals on hairy skins without hair removal. The autonomous liquefication of hydrogel adhesives allows easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any damages to hairy skins and electrode.








Abstract
Hydrogel adhesives have many important applications in the fields of drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioelectronics. The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli&#8208;mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins. Here, we report a transient hydrogel adhesive driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface. The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol&#8208;gel&#8208;sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and stable adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high&#8208;quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving. Notably, the autonomous liquefication of the hydrogel adhesives enables the easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any noticeable damages to the hairy skins and electrode. This work paves a new avenue in the innovative development of hydrogel adhesives for the conformable and detachable bioelectronic interface.

         <title>Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect</title>

         <dc:description>
Bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield due to overcoming confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. 








Abstract
During photocatalytic nitrogen fixation for ammonia synthesis, the photo&#8208;Dember effect causes direct transmission of photogenerated electrons from the illuminated surface to the bottom of photocatalyst, thus significantly reducing the number of charge carriers migrating on the surface and nitrogen fixation efficiency. Herein, a bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) is synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield of 591.94&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) after photocatalytic N2 reduction under simulated solar light irradiation. The designed (101)/(001) interface in BOC(101)&#8208;OVs generates a self&#8208;built electric field (Eself) on the material surface due to different atomic arrangements. Therefore, the newly developed material achieved &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing the transfer path, i.e., from bulk phase transfer to surface lateral transfer path, thus escaping confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. Meanwhile, after OVs construction, each adsorbed N2 molecule simultaneously bonds with three Bi atoms of material through N 2p&#8211;Bi 6p bonding, accelerating the filling of high&#8208;energy electrons into the &#960;* orbital of N2, leading to a new nitrogen reduction path with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation. This study greatly advances the beneficial effect of charge carrier migration through overcoming the photo&#8208;Dember effect for ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Hydroxylation of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene Coupled with Short Chain Branching Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation enables C&#9472;H hydroxylation of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) along with the growth of methyl and ethyl short&#8208;chain branches. Fluorine on the ligand enhances the interaction with LDPE while facilitating hydrogen peroxide activation. The growth of short&#8208;chain branches occurs via &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. The oxidized LDPE exhibits significantly improved mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after being discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to a lack of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#9472;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me&#8208;SCB) and ethyl shortchain branching (Et&#8208;SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight.

     alt="Iron(III)-Catalyzed C&#9472;H Hydroxylation of Low-Density Polyethylene Coupled with Short Chain Branching Growth"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild iron(III)-catalyzed oxidative degradation enables C&#9472;H hydroxylation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) along with the growth of methyl and ethyl short-chain branches. Fluorine on the ligand enhances the interaction with LDPE while facilitating hydrogen peroxide activation. The growth of short-chain branches occurs via &#946;-scission of CC bonds and a radical-mediated chain-walking mechanism. The oxidized LDPE exhibits significantly improved mechanical properties. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after being discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to a lack of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron(III)-catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#9472;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me-SCB) and ethyl shortchain branching (Et-SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight. CH&#8230;F interactions and &#963;&#8211;&#960; interactions are found between LDPE and the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism that fluorine on the ligand facilitates hydrogen peroxide activation and subsequent deprotonation, leading to the formation of high-valent ironoxo species. The growth of short-chain branching (SCB) involves the &#946;-scission of CC bonds and a radical-mediated chain-walking mechanism. This work represents a transformative advancement in deep understanding of polyolefin upcycling and opens a new approach of polyolefin functionalization and architecture modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Catalytic Degradation of Unsaturated Polyolefin Materials via Fe&#8208;Based Lewis Acids&#8208;Initiated Carbonyl&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefins using iron&#8208;based Lewis acids in solution was systematically studied. This carbonyl&#8211;olefin cross&#8208;metathesis strategy was proved to be highly effective in cleaving polymers containing carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds into short segments, even basic molecules for other compounds, e.g., pharmaceutical synthesis, confirming its universal applicability.








Abstract
Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials, including extensively used polyolefins, are becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratingly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects, e.g., C&#9552;C double bonds along the backbone, and subsequently depolymerize them via cross&#8208;metathesis reaction with olefins. High&#8208;value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two&#8208;step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into a polymer backbone, like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes. However, for the second step, to conduct a cross&#8208;metathesis reaction, only noble metal catalysts can be used most of the time. Regardless of their limited availability, the fact that these organometallics are unfavorably sensitive to impurities would raise barriers in industrial practices. Herein we employed earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive iron&#8208;based Lewis acids to initiate carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis reactions between ketone/aldehyde reagents and unsaturated polyolefins. After explorations in poly(diene)s and industrial thermoplastic elastomers, we extended this protocol to degrade low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). Low&#8208;molecular weight PE wax&#8208;like products were obtained as useful chemicals. This catalytic degradation system is expected to enable the development of more efficient metathesis strategies to promote degradation of polyolefins and pave sustainable ways for reuse of polymeric materials.

         <title>Pore Engineering in Isoreticular Titanium&#8208;Isophthalate Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we designed titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination polymers with functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. We conducted extensive investigations to explore how pore engineering influences adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings address the synthesis challenge of isostructural Ti&#8208;coordination polymers and offer insights into structure&#8211;property relationships through modulation of their chemical environments.








Abstract
Pore engineering through chemical environment modification is vital for developing industrial porous materials. Understanding the effects of substitutions in isoreticular porous coordination polymers&#8212;such as steric hindrance, vibrational capabilities, electronic influences, and hydropathy&#8212;is key to elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. However, accurately assessing the impact of functional groups on properties remains challenging due to limitations in current methodologies. In this study, we designed a series of titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination&#8208;polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium&#8208;coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8211;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis was developed to access aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers. The resulting aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability and stability, as well as a range of desirable thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, showing potential toward sustainable materials.








Abstract
The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#9472;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.

The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutics.

Abstract
Cell membrane disruption is associated with numerous diseases and underlies the activity of various antimicrobial agents. The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutic drugs. Here, we present a single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy assay integrated with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics to study membrane permeabilization in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing as few as seven dye molecules. This assay eliminates the need for liposome immobilization and achieves detection rates in the range of 1000 vesicles per minute, offering unparalleled sensitivity and detection limits as low as 135 pM, corresponding to just eight permeabilizing molecules per vesicle for active compounds such as ionomycin. It provides a robust platform for investigating membrane&#8208;disrupting agents, including those with antimicrobial properties or implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>In Situ Cation Exchange Enables Air&#8208;Processed Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with over 25% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

In situ cation exchange strategies were utilized to fabricate a PbI&#8322; shell on perovskite surfaces, improving crystallinity, the energy level alignment, and reducing defects of perovskite films. The devices fabricated in ambient air could achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% with excellent stability under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I protocols. 








Abstract
The scalable fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) in humid air with an antisolvent&#8208;free process is essential for future industrial applications. However, high humidity poses significant challenges for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films, making it difficult to attain efficient IPSCs under ambient conditions. Here, we present an in situ cation exchange strategy to create a compact and uniform PbI&#8322; shell on the perovskite surface by using ZnI&#8322; in acetonitrile (ACN), where Zn2+ replaces Pb2+. This transformation is attributed to the surface defects of the perovskite, which undergo a cation exchange reaction in humid air, forming a compact PbI&#8322; shell. The n&#8208;type PbI&#8322; shell effectively encapsulates the perovskite films, minimizing air exposure while optimizing energy level alignment, thereby enhancing electron transport and extraction. As a result, we demonstrate IPSCs with efficiencies of 25.2% under ambient conditions (25&#176;&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C, 60%&#160;&#177;&#160;10% relative humidity [RH]), on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices fabricated in inert atmospheres. The devices demonstrated remarkable stability, enduring aging tests under the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I for over 4770 and 2000&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Unnatural Triggers Converted From Tetrazine&#8208;Attached Sialic Acid for Activation of Optoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazine precursors (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold are rationally designed and synthesized, which can be efficiently converted into unnatural tetrazine (Tz) triggers on cancer cell surfaces via metabolic glycoengineering. These Tz triggers activate theranostic agents for multispectral optoacoustic tomographic (MSOT) imaging, enabling localization and image&#8208;guided therapy of orthotopic and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Constructing chemical groups on cell membranes through metabolic glycoengineering of unnatural sugars is an effective means to solve the issue of insufficient or even lack of targets in cancer theranostics. Herein, we address the limitations by developing a tetrazine precursor (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold and then utilizing it to create unnatural tetrazine triggers on the surface of cancer cells. SiaTz exhibits a good balance between the stability and reaction kinetics under physiological conditions and can be efficiently converted into corresponding tetrazine trigger through bypassing several size&#8208;limiting steps in metabolic glycoengineering process. We also prepare a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept theranostic combination of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivative (CyTCO) and a thermal&#8208;sensitive drug 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane]&#8208;dihydrochloride (AIPH) to verify the activation function of tetrazine triggers in theranostics of orthotopic and metastatic tumors. In the presence of tetrazine triggers, CyTCO can be activated via bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction to induce optoacoustic signal enhancement, enabling high&#8208;contrast diagnostic imaging and precise tumor localization to guide subsequent treatments. Tetrazine trigger&#8208;activated CyTCO displays high photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, which can cause an obvious increase in temperature under laser irradiation and then initiate AIPH decomposition to produce toxic radicals for combined therapy.

         <title>Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C with High&#8208;Density Atomically Dispersed Mn Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;step incorporation of manganese into the nitrogen&#8211;carbon materials results in an atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with a high Mn density. This strategy promotes Mn content and anti&#8208;demetallization, enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability. After 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave potential cycles, the fuel cell retains 81.6% of its initial peak power density.








Abstract
The utilization of transition metal&#8211;based catalysts as alternatives presents an attractive solution for enhancing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reducing costly platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Manganese&#8208;based nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C) is anticipated to exhibit durability due to its weaker Fenton reaction propensity. However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three&#8208;step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo&#8208;MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only 18.4% decay after 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;Free Organic/Inorganic Interphase for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) is proposed as an additive for achieving aqueous Zn batteries combining performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness, which not only modulates the Zn2+ solvation structure but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of an F&#8208;free organic (zinc chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer. 








Abstract
Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn2+ conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)&#8208;containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F&#8208;free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low&#8208;cost N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn2+ but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue toward practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness.

         <title>Adaptive Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Clusters: Consistent Redox Behavior Versus Reversible Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters containing structurally analogous or differentiated cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in distinct oxidation states have been synthesized, which prove to be chemically interconvertible. The analysis of the strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained from the solution of these clusters indicates that they are electrochemically interconvertible through either reversible or irreversible pathways. This work provides a reference on how Fe&#8208;S/Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters mediate the electron transfer processes through redox&#8208;adaptive structural transformations.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are critical in a number of important biological processes, where their structural integrity can be maintained or reversibly transformed. However, it remains ambiguous how Fe&#8208;S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox&#8208;induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent&#8208;ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride&#8208;free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride&#8208;free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe&#8208;S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.

         <title>Leaching&#8208;Induced Ti Trapping Stabilizes Amorphous IrOx for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir/TiN evolves into Ti&#8208;trapped IrOx, owing to the TiN leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect under long&#8208;term oxygen evolution conditions, which helps to stabilize the Ir(III) and lattice oxygen sites on the amorphous IrOx while realizing self&#8208;thickening of the ultrathin catalyst layer in the realistic device, benefiting low&#8208;Ir based water electrolysis.








Abstract
Transition metal nitrides are promising conductive support materials in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas it is unclear if their electrochemical oxidation during prolonged test would affect the OER catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect from TiN supports effectively stabilizes the electrochemically oxidized amorphous IrOx catalyst. Structural characterizations reveal that the TiN support experiences severe leaching during OER test, leaving minor amounts of Ti&#8211;O species trapping on IrOx clusters, which mitigate the overoxidation of Ir(III) species and elongate the Ir&#8211;O bonds. This leads to 70% reduction of lattice oxygen oxidation and the substantially reduced Ir leaching. Additionally, self&#8208;thickening of the catalyst layers is found during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), enabling an ultralow catalyst loading of 87 &#181;gIr cm&#8722;2 to obtain a stable operation at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. This work deepens the understanding of TiN&#8208;supported catalysts for long&#8208;term stable OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Mediated Rearrangement of Bis(alkynyl)boranes: B&#9472;C Activation versus C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Bis(alkynyl)boranes bearing different B&#8208;substituents reacted with Cp*2Ti(Me3SiCCSiMe3), leading to the formation of B&#9472;C activation products (top right) and C&#9472;H activation products (bottom right), respectively.








Abstract
Reactions between Rosenthal's titanocene (Cp2Ti) and decamethyltitanocene (Cp*2Ti) synthons with various bis(alkynyl)boranes were investigated. A series of titanium&#8208;fused boracyclobutenes were obtained through the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)2NB(CCR)2 or PhB(CCPh)2. This represents the first realization of approaching this structural motif via the rearrangement of bis(alkynyl)boranes within the coordination sphere of a d&#8208;block metal. These findings break the previous limitation that the boron substituent must be an amino group. Furthermore, the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)PhNB(CCPh)2 or (Mes2B)PhNB(CCPh)2 (Mes&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) led to the formation of novel tethered metallocene complexes, in which the titanacyclopentadiene structure is linked to one of the cyclopentadienyl groups via a &#9472;CH2&#9472;BR&#9472; bridge. Both experimental and theoretical studies provided insights into an unprecedented reaction mechanism. The process involves the initial formation of an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated bis(alkynyl)borane intermediate, which was detected and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This intermediate subsequently undergoes either B&#9472;Calkynyl bond activation or CMe&#9472;H activation of the Cp* ligand, leading to the formation of two distinct types of products.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomative Epoxidation of Naphthalenes with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective epoxidation of naphthalenes into their corresponding arene oxides with aqueous hydrogen peroxide is described. The reaction combines dearomatization with installation of chemically versatile functionality in an enantioselective manner. Chemo and enantioselectivity relies in the synergy of a novel e&#8208;rich and sterically encumbered manganese catalyst and amino acids featuring tert&#8208;butyl leucine moiety as coligands. 








Abstract
Arenes are abundantly occurring molecules of significant interest as versatile starting materials in organic reactions. Typically, oxidation of arenes yields planar molecules such as phenols and quinones. However, several iron dependent oxygenases can disrupt the aromaticity of arenes through oxidation and introduce C(sp3)&#9472;O stereogenic centers, resulting in precious enantioenriched epoxide or diol products. Emulating this enzymatic behavior with synthetic catalysts has met little success until now. Herein we describe a catalytic chemo&#8208; and enantioselective dearomative epoxidation of naphthalenes. The singular chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity features of the reaction critically rely on a manganese catalyst that combines electron donating groups and steric demand on the ligand and activates hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions and short reaction times. Assisted with an N&#8208;protected amino acid, this catalyst epoxidizes a range of naphthalenes providing chemically versatile diepoxides in moderate to good yields and high levels of enantioselectivity. Straightforward elaboration gives diverse access to densely functionalized 3D structurally rich oxygenated molecules. The reaction constitutes a paradigmatical example of expedient access to stereochemically rich, valuable oxygenated molecules from readily available feedstocks, enabled by highly reactive yet selective biologically inspired oxidation catalysts.

A cationic Ir(I)&#8208;complex modified with the chiral diphosphine DM&#8208;SEGPHOS mediates the enantioselective hydroalkylation of diverse &#945;&#8208;substituted styrenes with N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives.

Abstract
A cationic Ir(I)&#8208;complex modified with the chiral diphosphine DM&#8208;SEGPHOS mediates the hydroalkylation of diverse &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes with N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives. The processes occur with complete branched selectivity and high enantioselectivity. Styrenes possessing higher &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituents also participate to provide the targets with moderate to excellent levels of diastereoselectivity. The products are readily advanced to &#946;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are inaccessible or cumbersome to access by other means. In broader terms, the study demonstrates how catalyst controlled C&#9472;H additions across alkenes can be used to execute the by&#8208;product&#8208;free construction of contiguous acyclic trisubstituted and quaternary centers.

         <title>Influence of Ligand Design and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Butyrolactone Using Salan and Salalen Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>

Polyhydroxybutyrates are key sustainable polyesters, but controlling the stereoregularity is crucial for exhibiting the most promising thermal and mechanical properties. Highly active rare&#8208;earth metal salan/salalen complexes yield isotactic (Pm up to 0.96 at 0 &#176;C) or syndioenriched (Pr up to 0.91) PHB, depending on the steric demand of the ligand and non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) in the catalytic system. 








Abstract
We herein report the influence of the ligand framework on the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;butyrolactone using highly active in situ generated salan [ONNO]H2 and salalen [ONNO]H rare&#8208;earth metal complexes. The stereochemistry was found to be highly dependent on the ortho&#8208;substituents, enabling the synthesis of either isotactic poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (up to Pm&#160;=&#160;0.92) or syndiotactic PHB (up to Pr&#160;=&#160;0.91). To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control (ESC), a new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT, and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for the future design of catalysts for isoselective ROP.

         <title>Cooperative Iron&#8211;Aluminium Reactivity for Dinitrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen activation was achieved through cooperative bimetallic reactivity of a Fe&#9472;Al system, which features flexible, covalent metal&#8211;metal bonding, and captures two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Subsequent alkylation of the Al site leads to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex that facilitates the silylation of the terminal N atom. 








Abstract
We report a novel bimetallic approach utilizing cooperative Fe&#9472;Al reactivity for N2 activation on the Cp*Fe(1,2&#8208;Cy2PC6H4AlEt) platform, effectively capturing two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Characterizations of the N2&#8208;bridged Fe&#9472;Al dimer (2) using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy coupled to density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals its electronic structure as a resonance hybrid between Fe(II)&#8208;Al(I) and Fe(0)&#8208;Al(III). The flexible, covalent Fe&#9472;Al bonding facilitates the subsequent alkylation of the Al site with nBuLi, leading to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex (3) that enables the silylation of the terminal N atom. Our findings highlight the significance of leveraging Fe&#9472;Al effects as an electron buffer to achieve facile N2 activation.

         <title>A Sustainable and Scalable Approach for In Situ Induction of Gradient Nucleation Sites in Biomass&#8208;Derived Interface Layers for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;based Cu2+&#8208;carboxymethyl chitosan&#8208;kaolin (CuCK) layer composed of in situ galvanically and galvanostatically induced gradient alloy nucleation sites to achieve durable Zn anodes (Zn@CuCK) is designed, which significantly enhances adhesion to the Zn anode, demonstrates abundant zincophilicity, promotes continuous vertical zinc deposition with high plating/stripping reversibility, regulates Zn2+ flux, and facilitates Zn2+ transfer and desolvation. This study provides a sustainable and scalable method to in situ induce gradient nucleation sites in interface layer for engineering durable Zn anodes, promising for practical aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;grid energy storage due to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and durability. However, challenges like dendrite growth, corrosion, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the zinc anode hinder their performance. Herein, we propose a sustainable and scalable approach to form a copper gluconate@carboxymethyl chitosan@kaolin (CuCK) interface layer, inducing gradient nucleation sites via in situ galvanic and galvanostatic processes. The biomass&#8208;based CuCK coating features a gradient CuxZny alloy structure that homogenizes interfacial electric field distribution and enhances electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the incorporated Cu2+&#8208;loaded kaolin and carboxymethyl chitosan regulate Zn2+ flux, accelerate Zn2+ desolvation, and suppress HER. The resulting Zn@CuCK anode achieves a high cumulative capacity of 5500&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, exhibits excellent durability in Zn@CuCK//NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells across a wide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 60&#160;&#176;C), and endows the assembly of pouch cells with high energy density.

         <title>Structures of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, Producing Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PHA synthase (PhaC) is the key enzyme in the polymerization of a biodegradable plastic&#8212;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Structures of full&#8208;length PhaC reveal three key regions essential for substrate specificity and polymerization. Additionally, this study also highlights the critical role of N&#8208;domain&#8208;dependent dimerization in PhaC activity. These findings provide a foundation for enzyme engineering to enhance bioplastic production.








Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biodegradable polyester that can serve as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, which present a serious source of pollution. PHA synthase (PhaC) is a key enzyme responsible for producing a wide variety of PHAs in microorganisms. Here, we present crystal structures of full&#8208;length PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, a high&#8208;performance PhaC employed for industrial use. The structure reveals an N&#8208;terminal helical domain that mediates head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization and stabilizes the C&#8208;terminal &#945;/&#946; catalytic domain to form a tunnel that connects the catalytic center embedded inside the protein to the protein surface. We showed that this tunnel is a putative egress tunnel for the product PHA chain. Our results establish a fundamental understanding of the PhaC machinery that should lead to improvement of this enzyme in industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;PHA synthase (PhaC) is the key enzyme in the polymerization of a biodegradable plastic&#8212;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Structures of full-length PhaC reveal three key regions essential for substrate specificity and polymerization. Additionally, this study also highlights the critical role of N-domain-dependent dimerization in PhaC activity. These findings provide a foundation for enzyme engineering to enhance bioplastic production.

         <title>NO&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Nanovesicles with Co&#8208;Stimulatory Molecule Self&#8208;Presentation for Multidimensional Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

An ultrasonic&#8208;empowered nanoDC that integrates NO&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer with artificial DC membrane is utilized to orchestrate a potent T cell immune response. The artificial membrane from genetically engineered CD86+ tumor cells directly activates infiltrating T cells, which are recruited by ultrasound&#8208;triggered protein S&#8208;nitrosylation and tumor ICD. The nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune activation in tumor sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Synergistically improving T cell responsiveness represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors; however, current treatments struggle to fully activate cancer&#8208;immunity cascade. We propose a novel gas&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanoplatform, triggering ultrasonic&#8208;sensitive tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and cascading immune activation. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the nanocore liberates reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, generating highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in situ. The ONOO&#8722; then orchestrated several intracellular events, including protein S&#8208;nitrosylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ICD&#8208;enhanced immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, the biomimetic artificial dendritic cell (DC) membranes, from genetically engineered tumor cells, simultaneously present peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHC&#8208;I) and CD86, enabling homologous tumor targeting but also mimicking the antigen presentation and costimulatory signaling of DCs to directly activate infiltrating T lymphocytes. In multiple murine models, this nanovaccine demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy, including tumor suppression, long&#8208;lasting antitumor immunity, and tumor metastasis inhibition. The ultrasound&#8208;responsive nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune boosters to address the challenges of immune tolerance and suboptimal patient response.

         <title>High Performance Capacitive Deionization Cathode of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Doped with Trace Molybdenum: Breaking the Capacity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>

The high valence metal Mo&#8208;doped NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF electrode exhibits excellent desalination properties, including amazing adsorption capacity and remarkable cycling stability. Structural characterization and DFT studies show that NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF possesses multiple redox sites, low Na+ migration barriers, excellent reaction reversibility, and remarkable structural stability, resulting in an unprecedented improvement in desalination performance.








Abstract
Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is considered one of the most promising electrode materials for capacitive deionization (CDI) because of its excellent cycling stability and other advantages. However, the poor desalination ability and low adsorption capacity caused by a single reaction site seriously restrict its practical application. Here, a high&#8208;valence transition metal element Mo&#8208;doped strategy is proposed to utilize traces of Mo6+ to activate the inert&#8208;sites within NiHCF. The Mo&#8208;doped NiHCF electrodes (NiMox&#8208;HCF) with multiple pairs of redox active sites and long cycling capability were designed, breaking the trade&#8208;off between high adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The results show that the preferred NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF not only retains the excellent cycling stability (91% after 200 cycles), but also possesses a high adsorption capacity of 90.92&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 1.2&#160;V, which is much better than those of NiHCF under the same conditions. In addition, it has good practical application in simulated brackish water and circulating cooling water. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the Mo doping strategy enhanced electronic conductivity while maintaining structural stability. This research proposes a new method to activate inert sites using high&#8208;valence elements, thus effectively balancing the adsorption capacity and cycling stability of the electrode.

         <title>Supramolecular Recognition of a DNA Four&#8208;Way Junction by an M2L4 Metallo&#8208;Cage, Inspired by a Simulation&#8208;Guided Design Approach</title>

DNA Holliday junctions, or four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) are an attractive therapeutic target due to their prevalence in DNA replication and repair, and viral disease. Combining experimental and computational methods, we show that quadruple&#8208;stranded dinuclear platinum metallo&#8208;cages are an excellent size and shape match for the cavity of the 4WJ open conformation, binding with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for junctions. 








Abstract
DNA four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) play an important biological role in DNA repair and recombination, and viral regulation, and are attractive therapeutic targets. Compounds that recognise the junction structure are rare; in this work, we describe cationic metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages as a new type of 4WJ binder with nanomolar affinities. A combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments show that the size and shape of a compound comprising square planar Pd or Pt and anthracene&#8208;based ligands is an excellent fit for the 4WJ cavity. Whilst the cage is also capable of binding to three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) and Y&#8208;fork structures, we show that the 4WJ is the preferred DNA target, and that duplex B&#8208;DNA is not a competitor. Among 3WJs, T&#8208;shape bulged 3WJs are bound more preferably than perfect Y&#8208;shaped 3WJs. Whilst previous work studying M2L4 metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages has focused on binding inside their structures, this work exploits the external aromatic surfaces of the supramolecule, creating a supramolecular guest that ideally matches the DNA host cavity. This approach allows available structures to be identified as potential junction binders and then screened for their fit to a nucleic acid junction target using simulations. This has potential to significantly accelerate discovery.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Ortho&#8208;Arylation Reaction of Benzoic Acids with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic ortho&#8208;arylation method has been developed to convert arylthianthrenium salts into carboxylate&#8208;functionalized biaryls, which can be removed in situ or used for further derivatization. This reaction is broadly applicable to (hetero)arenecarboxylic acids, with excellent functional group compatibility and orthogonality to cross&#8208;couplings, enhancing the utility of thianthrenium salts in drug discovery.








Abstract
Arylthianthrenium salts have become key intermediates for late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug&#8208;like molecules. Ruthenium&#8208;phosphine catalysts are now shown to enable their use as aryl sources in high&#8208;yielding ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of benzoic acids. The arylthianthrenium salts are converted chemo&#8208;selectively, leaving aryl halides and boronates untouched. The carboxylate groups are uniquely effective as directing groups, ensuring exclusive ortho&#8208;selectivity even in the presence of competing pyridine or amide groups. This makes the reaction orthogonal to cross&#8208;couplings and conventional C&#9472;H arylations. The carboxylate group can be removed via decarboxylation or serve as an anchor for downstream transformations. Mechanistic studies identify C&#9472;H ruthenation as the rate&#8208;limiting step and highlight the unique efficiency of P(Cy)&#8323; ligands.

Mechanistic studies identify C&#9472;H ruthenation as the rate-limiting step and highlight the unique efficiency of P(Cy)&#8323; ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC) achieves 200% FE and 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density via dual&#8208;electrode H2 generation, enabling CO2&#8208;free energy production. 








Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO), a promising yet challenging hydrogen carrier, offers a unique opportunity for efficient hydrogen generation through electro&#8208;oxidation, simultaneously eliminating harmful HCHO and contributing to environmental sustainability. This study rises to the challenge by pioneering a hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC), an integrated system that integrates anodic partial electro&#8208;reforming of aldehydes at low potential with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The device introduces a new self&#8208;powered paradigm for hydrogen generation, driven by electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE), featuring high Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production, co&#8208;generation of electricity, and HCOOH. The h&#8208;AAFHFC attains an open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.11&#160;V and a peak power density of 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, enabling simultaneous hydrogen production at both electrodes with an extraordinary Faradaic efficiency of approximately 200%. This breakthrough marks a transformative shift, moving from traditional electricity&#8208;driven systems to self&#8208;sustaining H2 generation. Our work demonstrates a promising pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, advancing the potential of clean hydrogen energy technologies.

Herein, a high polarity interface material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). CNCB exhibits the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability.








Abstract
Designing new interface materials with the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation is crucial for developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a high polarity interfacial material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the PSCs. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that CNCB interacts with perovskite precursors (PbI2 and FAI) to regulate crystallization kinetics, yielding perovskite films with preferred orientation and reduced defects. Simultaneously, CNCB chemically interacts with both SnO2 and perovskite surfaces, effectively passivating oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and undercoordinated Pb2&#8314; defects at the perovskite buried surface. Furthermore, the high dipole moment of CNCB induces beneficial interfacial polarization, optimizing energy level alignment and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability, retaining 87.14% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination. This work establishes a molecular design paradigm for multifunctional interfacial materials in perovskite optoelectronics, highlighting the synergistic roles of crystallization control, defect passivation, and dipole engineering in high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Altering the Symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C by Axial Cl&#8208;Mediation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy to alter the symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration via axial coordination of chlorine atoms to FePc molecules on CNTs matrix. The elongated Fe&#9472;N bonds and the transformation of Fe&#9472;N4 symmetry (from D4h to C4v) mitigate the dissolution of Fe centers, by which it allows to lower the ORR overpotential, optimize *OH desorption, and suppress harmful molecule adsorption, substantially improving ORR activity and the stability in zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy is proposed on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure toward achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C (FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc&#8208;CNTs (0.88&#160;V versus RHE). The advanced nature of the as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs is evidenced by a configured high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery, which operates stably for over 150&#160;h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D4h to C4v symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe&#8208;center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration.

         <title>Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I) Alkynyl Nanoclusters with Exposed Polyoxomolybdate Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic active sites located on the periphery of the Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters significantly contributed to their exceptional photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction, demonstrating an impressive selectivity of nearly 100% toward CO.








Abstract
The directed synthesis of copper(I) nanoclusters with atomically precise active sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses notable challenges. By carefully regulating the acidity of the reaction system, a set of five atomically precise Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters were effectively synthesized. The adjustment of the reaction system's acidity stimulates the polymerization of molybdate, consequently influencing the encapsulation structure of the outer copper(I) shell and thereby controlling the number of catalytically active sites located at the periphery of these nanoclusters. When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 160.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO2RR system, the maximum CO production rates for Mo16Cu36&#8208;1 and Mo22Cu30 were 5672.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 7370.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#9472;O&#9472;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study not only elucidates the synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO2RR but also contributes to advancing our comprehension of the structure&#8208;property relationship inherent in nanocluster photocatalysts.

When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO (up to 160.8&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR system, the maximum CO production rates for &lt;b&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; were 5672.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 7370.8&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#9472;O&#9472;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study not only elucidates the synthesis of high-nuclearity Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR but also contributes to advancing our comprehension of the structure-property relationship inherent in nanocluster photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Synergistic Dual Activation Enables Efficient Transesterification by Multinuclear Titanium Catalyst: Recycling and Upcycling of Polyester Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that facilitates the methanolysis of PET waste with record&#8208;high activity through a synergistic bi&#8208;titanium&#8208;facilitated dual activation mechanism. This catalyst also enables the re&#8208;polymerization of recovered monomers, promoting an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, it can be directly applied to upgrade PET waste into value&#8208;added engineering plastics, biodegradable polyesters, and thermoplastic elastomers.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient and selective catalysts for chemical recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is essential for establishing a sustainable plastics economy and reducing environmental impact. Here, we report a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that enables highly efficient transesterification reactions of esters and polyesters. Detailed experimental and computational studies have revealed that a bi&#8208;titanium framework facilitates a dual activation mechanism, activating both alcohol and ester simultaneously, thereby significantly enhancing the transesterification process. This catalyst demonstrated exceptionally high activity in the methanolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with an activity up to 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;gPET&#160;molTi&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 0.005&#160;mol% catalyst loading, producing polymerizable dimethyl ester and glycol monomers. Additionally, it effectively catalyzed the re&#8208;polymerization of the recovered monomers, yielding the original polyester with high molecular weight and thereby achieving an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, this catalyst can also be utilized for the efficient upgrading of PET waste via transesterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol, polybutylene adipate, and poly(tetramethyene ether glycol), yielding engineering plastic, biodegradable polyester, and thermoplastic elastomer, respectively.

         <title>Fullerene Network&#8208;Buffered Platinum Nanoparticles Toward Efficient and Stable Electrochemical Ammonia Oxidation Reaction for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using covalently bonded two&#8208;dimensional fullerene (C60) polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) as unique support of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), we succeed in modulating the binding strengths of the key intermediates in the AOR process owing to the electron transfer between PNW&#8208;C60 and Pt NPs, which can enhance the recombination of NxHy species, avoiding the poisoning of adsorbed nitrogen&#8208;containing species. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Pt NPs/PNW&#8208;C60 exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 for the AOR as well as remarkable long&#8208;term durability, which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs.








Abstract
Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier due to its well&#8208;established production, storage, and transportation infrastructure. Moreover, hydrogen production via electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) requires a significantly lower theoretical potential than water electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor stability of AOR hinder the industrial application of ammonia electrolysis. Herein, we report the construction of two&#8208;dimensional covalently bonded fullerene polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as a highly active and stable AOR electrocatalyst. The unique electron buffering effect of PNW&#8208;C60 enhances the desorption of nitrogen&#8208;containing species and prevents their poisoning on the Pt NPs surface. Consequently, the as&#8208;obtained PNW&#8208;C60&#8208;buffered Pt NPs exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 as well as good stability, outperforming commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs AOR catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Multi&#8208;Interface Chemistry by Functional Carbon Dots for High&#8208;Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of synergistic multi&#8208;interfacial regulation is proposed to construct high&#8208;performance composite solid electrolytes, and N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots play the key role in regulating multi&#8208;interfacial structures, including the conversion of surface residual alkali of LLZTO into ionic conductor interlayer and the formation of bridging interlayer between PEO and LLZTO.








Abstract
Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength, and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi&#8208;interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte. Here, the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion&#8208;conducting and an electron&#8208;insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self&#8208;assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion&#8208;exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation, and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications.

         <title>Circular RNA&#8208;Based Molecular Computation Enhances Plasma Biomarker Detection in Biliary Tract Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system integrating plasma circular RNA (circRNA) biomarkers for diagnosing biliary tract cancer (BTC). By identifying four differentially expressed circRNAs, we designed a logistic regression model (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.970) translated into a DNA computation framework, demonstrating cost&#8208;effective, rapid diagnostics without complex instrumentation.








Abstract
Molecular diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Although large panels based on multi&#8208;biomarkers have demonstrated potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, their clinical application is hindered by complexity and high costs. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.

To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA-based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Design of Fenton&#8208;Like Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Adaptive Learning with Genetic Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an advanced adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA) to optimize Fenton&#8208;like Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) synthesis, markedly reducing experimental iterations. Unlike traditional methods, ALGA integrates genetic principles with active learning, identifying high&#8208;performance Fenton&#8208;like SACs with minimal experimentation. Results demonstrate a threefold efficiency gain in phenol degradation with our optimized SACs, showcasing ALGA's potential in accelerating the design of SACs.








Abstract
Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for optimizing catalyst synthesis are time&#8208;consuming and costly, exploring only a small fraction of the vast combinatorial space. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative but still has the limitation of relying on well&#8208;selected initial datasets, which the recent development of active learning (AL) could be addressed. Here, we novelly integrate an AL&#8208;derived algorithm, the adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA), into experimental workflows to optimize the synthesis of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Our results show that the closed&#8208;loop ALGA framework effectively learns from limited and sparse datasets, greatly reducing the research cycle compared to traditional ML and AL frameworks. By iteratively retaining better&#8208;performing genetic information and proactively expanding the search space through mutation and crossover, ALGA identifies the highest&#8208;performing Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs with less than 90 experiments. The maximum phenol degradation rate k&#8208;value (0.147&#160;min&#8722;1) achieved within the ALGA framework is approximately three times higher than that of the initial dataset and surpasses the reported best Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs. Our successful implementation of ALGA signifies an advancement in SACs synthesis assisted by the AL&#8208;derived algorithm, offering a guiding methodology for the exploration of other functional materials.

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition with tunable transition time and hydrogel stiffness have been realized by coupling the Hofmeister effect&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly with a simple enzymatic reaction. This new finding not only furthers the understanding of specific ion effect in control of biological functions but also offers a new opportunity for the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating soft materials.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular interactions is essential for the creation of dynamic supramolecular materials with lifelike self&#8208;regulating functions. Yet specific ion effect, which is known to possess potent effect on intermolecular interactions, has remained unexplored for such a purpose. Here, we demonstrate our access to dynamic self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular hydrogels by orchestrating the Hofmeister effect through a simple enzymatic reaction. The involved gelators containing carboxylate moieties self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel1) at acidic pH and dissolve at basic pH. We surprisingly find that the dissolved gelators at basic pH can be driven to self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel2) by kosmotropic ions through the disruption of gelator&#8211;water interactions. By coupling to the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, Gel1 gradually disintegrates over time because of the production of basic NH3. However, interestingly, with the accumulation of kosmotropic ions, NH4+ and CO32&#8722;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self&#8208;assemble into Gel2, realizing a self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion&#8208;programmed biosensing and drug delivery.

         <title>Bismuth Meets Olefins: Ethylene Activation and Reversible Alkene Insertion into Bi&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth compounds have been exposed to simple &#945;&#8208;olefins, including the benchmark substrate ethylene. Unprecedented and facile insertion, extrusion, and olefin exchange scenarios have been realized. The scope, mechanism, and functional group tolerance of these peerless transformations have been investigated in a combined experimental and theoretical approach.








Abstract
Owing to its fundamental properties as the parent olefin, its outstanding industrial relevance, and the challenges associated with its activation, ethylene remains a benchmark substrate, especially in main group chemistry. Here we report the unprecedented activation of ethylene and related simple &#945;&#8208;olefins by well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth complexes. The polarization of a substrate by a softly Lewis&#8208;acidic central atom and a nucleophilic functional group positioned in a constrained geometry is for the first time exploited in the activation of ethylene and related olefins by compounds of a heavy p&#8208;block element. Mechanistic investigations point toward a coordination&#8208;insertion&#8208;reaction mechanism. The bonding properties of the cationic bismuth species facilitate unprecedented reversible reactivity patterns and unusual characteristics in chemoselectivity.

         <title>Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Pure Nitrate Reduction via Tuning Bimetallic Sites in Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction was enhanced by modulating the adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption of species in the CoN4&#8211;NiS4 system. a The [CoN4] site selectively adsorbs and reduces nitrate, while the [NiS4] site mimics ferredoxin to accelerate nitrite conversion. Dynamic *H equilibrium suppresses the HER and enhances ammonia selectivity. The thiophene unit facilitates electron transfer and optimizes reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) represents a promising approach for ammonia synthesis, but existing application has been constrained by the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics induced by various intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a series of metalized covalent organic frameworks: NiTP&#8208;MTAPP MCOFs (M&#160;=&#160;2H, Co, Cu, and Fe), based on dual redox&#8208;active centers: thiophene&#8208;substituted Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) ligand&#8208;Ni[C2S2(C4H2SCHO)2]2 and metallic porphyrin. Through regulating the adsorption and desorption of species at the catalytic sites, we have identified the optimal NITRR electrocatalyst: NiTP&#8208;CoTAPP MCOF, which achieved the highest faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 85.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs. RHE) in pure nitrate solution, with an impressive yield rate of 160.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. The generation of active hydrogen at [NiS4] sites achieved dynamic equilibrium with the timely hydrogenation reaction at CoN4 sites, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of thiophene (TP) groups and metal ions facilitates charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the reduction in energy barriers at different catalytic sites. The CoN4&#8722;NiS4 system exhibited the optimal adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption capability and the lowest energy barrier (0.58&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO&#160;&#8594;&#160;*HNO), which is supported by the moderate d&#8208;band center and Bader charge value.

         <title>Constructions of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles Through Phosphine&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Controlled Switch of Selectivity Between Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discloses phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled switch of the chemoselectivity between Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular and intermolecular cyclizations. Easily dissociating P(tBu)3 ligand promotes intramolecular macrocyclization due to favorable interaction of Pd&#8208;catalyst with coordinating groups of substrates to construct strained and strain&#8208;free 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles, and PPh3 ligand affords strained&#8208;free macrocycles via intermolecular coupling pathway.








Abstract
The rigid biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles serve as core scaffolds in numerous bioactive molecules. However, constructing biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles smaller than 14&#8208;membered ring remains challenging, partially due to the strain present in the cyclic intermediates formed during their synthesis. Here, we report that a Pd catalyst supported by P(tBu)3 effectively promotes the intramolecular ortho C&#9472;H arylation of phenols with aryl bromides, leading to the efficient synthesis of both strained 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles and strain&#8208;free bimolecular counterparts. The success of this Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization in generating strained macrocycles originates from the dissociation of the P(tBu)3 ligand from the Pd center, which facilitates dual chelation of functional groups of substrates to the Pd center of palladacycle intermediate for alleviating its strain. Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemoselectivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

         <title>Unveiling an In Situ H2O2 Production: Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;H2O2 Battery Powering 26 LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery, which targets two birds&#8208;one stone approach via generating H2O2 while discharging and O2 while charging. In situ electrochemical Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopic measurements exhibited the formation of real&#8208;time analysis of products. Local pH insights were examined via micro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Moreover, Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries powered 26 LEDs for more than 7 days.








Abstract
Looking toward ever&#8208;growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices and carrying out electrocatalytic reactions in an efficient way is the need of the hour. Herein, we have employed the two birds&#8208;one stone approach, viz. fusing energy conversion and storing system enabling 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to value&#8208;added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO4 catalyst, without any external H2O2 source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H2O2 production of 98% @ 0.37 V versus RHE. The real&#8208;time H2O2 production was monitored by in&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition, viz. local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was meticulously examined through micro&#8208;electrochemical studies using gold (Au) microelectrodes. Further, we have explored an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery utilizing MnWO4 as bifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable H2O2 production simultaneously producing the electricity. The Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery exhibited a remarkable cycle life of 136&#160;h and an practical energy efficiency of 43%. The galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge measurement of Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery attained a capacity of 25&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The battery also demonstrated &#8805;90% cycle efficiency. Interestingly, the designed Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery (two connected in series) exhibited a stable open circuit voltage (OCV) with a promising power density of 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries by powering 26 blue LEDs for more than 180&#160;h (7 days) without fading in the illumination of LEDs.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Alkenylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine and Naphthalene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic dual chiral primary amine and naphthalene catalysis was identified through enamine&#8208;redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) to enable effective electrochemical singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO)&#8208;type coupling with alkenyl trifluoroborate. Mechanistic studies reveal ion&#8208;pair interactions between the protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate, leading to exceptional enantioselectivity.








Abstract
External tuning of enamine intermediate has significantly expanded reaction space of typical aminocatalysis. Notwithstanding the progress of chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;oxidation of enamine intermediate, electro&#8208;oxidation was left as a much less explored area, in stark contrast to the prosperous renaissance of electrochemistry in recent years. Challenges mainly come from the reactivity barrier as a consequence of heterogeneous electron transfer and subtle stereocontrol in ionic electrolyte solution under the influence of electric field. Herein, we report asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of carbonyl compounds using potassium alkenyl trifluoroborate as a model reaction to demonstrate the capability of primary amine catalysis under electrochemical conditions. By employing enamine redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) strategy, a new organic mediator, dimethoxyl naphthalene, was found to greatly enhance reactivity. Mechanistic studies uncover an ion&#8208;pair interaction between protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate that accounts for the exceptional enantioselectivity. This catalytic system demonstrates the best level of enantioselectivities in electro&#8208;oxidative enamine transformations so far.

         <title>Isomerisation and Insertion Chemistry of Imidosilanes Enabled by Reversible Si(IV)/Si(II) Redox Shuttling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rearrangement and functionalisation chemistry at silicon facilitated by reductive ligand migration and Si(II)/Si(IV) redox shuttling.








Abstract
Spontaneous redox shuttling at silicon is very rare, primarily reflecting the thermodynamic challenges associated with reduction processes for lighter p&#8208;block elements. Here we show that the reactions of boryl&#8208;substituted silylene {PhC(tBuN)2}Si{B(NDippCH)2} with an organo&#8208;azide proceed through a Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) series of redox processes involving both oxidative and reductive ligand migration steps. Each of the isomeric compounds related through this reaction manifold is isolable (and can be structurally characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography), with the overall free energy profile being close to thermo&#8208;neutral. Broader studies within group 14 imply that this redox shuttling is unique to silicon and that reductive ligand migration also plays a role in O&#8208;atom insertion chemistry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyanation of Propargylic Radicals Derived From Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched propargyl nitriles via copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyanation of propargylic radicals, which are generated from silyl&#8208;substituted allenes or alkynes. These reactions proceeded through a highly site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) with Cu(II)&#8208;bound nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs). Notably, silyl&#8208;substituted allenes demonstrate exceptional allenic sp2 C&#9472;H bond activation selectivity, outcompeting alternative reactive sp3 C&#9472;H bonds in HAA processes.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Ethynylation of Oxindoles: Total Synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Corynoxine, (&#8208;)&#8208;Isorhynchophylline, (&#8208;)&#8208;Aspidospermidine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;Limaspermidine</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;ethynylation of oxindoles is realized by virtue of spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA)&#8208;triazolium organocation catalysis. Taking advantage of this methodology and development of 1,6&#8208;aza&#8208;Michael additions with and without an aminolysis process, the collective total synthesis of two types of indole alkaloids was also accomplished.








Abstract
The all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center of oxindoles is a crucial structural element of a broad spectrum of indole alkaloids, imparting these molecules with rigid three&#8208;dimensional configurations essential for their biological activities. Here, we present a catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;ethynylation reaction of oxindoles taking advantage of the catalysis of a spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA) triazolium. This transformation enables the enantioselective construction of the C3 quaternary carbon stereocenter of oxindoles while introducing a versatile ethynyl functionality. Employment of this methodology has been demonstrated in the divergent total synthesis of indole alkaloids (&#8208;)&#8208;corynoxine, (&#8208;)&#8208;isorhynchophylline, (&#8208;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;limaspermidine, featuring a protecting group&#8208;dependent 1,6&#8208;Michael addition or an aminolysis/1,6&#8208;Michael addition sequence to generate two distinct types of spiro&#8208;indoles, tailored for different late&#8208;stage synthetic purposes.

         <title>Desulfurizative Fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 Thioformamides for the Efficient Synthesis of N(CF3)(CF2H) Amines with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines, which display a 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability over N&#8208;CF3 amines. The compounds are synthesized through a desulfurization&#8211;fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides. 








Abstract
With poor metabolic stability being a major cause of failure in drug development, there is a pressing need for strategic molecular modifications to optimize for desired properties and function. N&#8208;substitution has emerged as a powerful approach, with N&#8208;CF3 amines previously demonstrating enhanced lipophilicity and reduced susceptibility to oxidation, albeit inherent instability to hydrolysis. This report discloses the further evolution of this motif&#8212;the introduction of an additional N&#8208;difluoromethyl unit, resulting in an extraordinary 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability. We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines. The method relies on an operationally simple desulfurization&#8211;fluorination strategy of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides and is characterized by broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive Arylation and Alkenylation of Sulfinylamines to Access Sulfinamides Enabled by Cobalt Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines was developed, yielding enantiopure aryl and alkenyl sulfinamides with high efficiency. Mechanistic insights indicate that migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group is crucial for enantioselectivity.








Abstract
This study reports a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines, facilitating the efficient synthesis of enantiopure sulfinamides. By employing a cobalt/chiral diphosphine and tridentate ligand system, a range of diverse aryl and alkenyl iodides were successfully transformed into sulfinamides, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. This methodology underscores the utility of sulfinylamines as versatile electrophilic sulfur sources. Detailed mechanistic insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the key step involves migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group, which plays a crucial role in enantioselectivity. These findings offer a sustainable approach for the development of biologically relative enantiopure sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Day&#8208;Long Organic Persistent Luminescence in Flexible Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A day&#8208;long organic afterglow (28&#160;+&#160;h) is achieved via electron donor/acceptor exciplexes, where polyethylene naphthalate serves dual roles as acceptor/charge&#8208;storage unit and spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole acts as donor, enabling efficient UV/sunlight&#8208;triggered charge separation.








Abstract
The progress in organic afterglow materials has drawn significant attention due to their extensive applications in fields such as optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bioimaging. Nonetheless, a general limitation of organic afterglow materials is their short emission lifetimes, typically spanning from milliseconds to seconds, which creates a substantial challenge in developing day&#8208;long organic afterglow (DOA). In this study, a DOA system is demonstrated through the incorporation of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Polyethylene naphthalate is used for both the electron acceptor and charge storage units, coupling with a spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole derivative as the electron donor, providing effective charge separations under UV&#8208;light and sunlight excitation. The resulting DOA polymers demonstrate an exceptional bluish&#8208;green afterglow that endures for over 28&#160;h under ambient conditions, setting a new record for the longest afterglow duration in polymeric materials. Moreover, the DOA&#8208;doped polymers, as both films and fibers, exhibit outstanding flexibility and transparency, making them highly suitable for flexible technologies and wearable devices.

The resulting DOA polymers demonstrate an exceptional bluish-green afterglow that endures for over 28&#160;h under ambient conditions, setting a new record for the longest afterglow duration in polymeric materials. Moreover, the DOA-doped polymers, as both films and fibers, exhibit outstanding flexibility and transparency, making them highly suitable for flexible technologies and wearable devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Mg2+ Dication Weakly Stabilized/Coordinated in Solution: Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity, and Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating carborates was first prepared and structurally characterized as a soluble salt in organic solvents. Combined experimental and theoretical data provided valuable insights into its behavior/reactivity in solution. All data agree with a strong Lewis acidic Mg2+ center, readily coordinating alkenes and alkynes and effectively catalyzing alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation and imine hydrogenation.








Abstract
The first soluble and stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; is described. Mg[HexCB11Cl11]2 (1), prepared by reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][HexCB11Cl11], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg2+ surrounded by two [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; anions. In solution, experimental and classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained, reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting only weak anion/cation interactions, species 1 polymerizes 1&#8208;hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, 1 displays no reaction with HSiEt3 at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg2+ center. Contrasting with 1 (FIA&#160;=&#160;264&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]2 (2), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]&#8722; anion, is significantly less Lewis acidic (FIA&#160;=&#160;214.7&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and unreactive with alkenes and alkynes. Salt 1 effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It also efficiently catalyzes (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of HSiEt3. Salt 1 smoothly promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, and it is also an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H2.

         <title>Robust Tunnel TaOx Passivating Interlayer Enables Long&#8208;Term Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin TaOx interlayers via ALD boost n&#8208;Si/Ni photovoltage to 500&#160;mV and extend the stability to 500&#160;h in 1&#160;M KOH (&gt;90% performance). The amorphous TaOx layer passivates surface defects and resists corrosion, enabling durable solar&#8208;driven water splitting. This scalable strategy addresses interfacial degradation, advancing PEC technologies for clean fuel production.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells offer significant advantages for solar&#8208;to&#8208;clean fuel conversion but face challenges such as surface recombination and poor stability, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of device failure mechanisms and effective mitigation strategies. Using nickel&#8208;decorated n&#8208;type silicon (n&#8208;Si/Ni) as a model photoelectrode, we demonstrate that surface restructuring during operation initially passivates surface recombination but eventually blocks photogenerated hole transfer, leading to device failure. To mitigate this challenge, an ultrathin (&lt;1&#160;nm) tantalum oxide (TaOx) interlayer is introduced via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This TaOx layer serves as both a passivating contact and a corrosion&#8208;resistant coating. The n&#8208;Si/TaOx/Ni electrode achieves an increased photovoltage from 150 to 500&#160;mV during the activation process,&#160;and then significantly extends the device lifespan, maintaining over 90% performance for 500&#160;h in 1&#160;M KOH at 1.52&#160;V versus RHE. These results highlight the implementation of amorphous TaOx in enhancing both the efficiency and durability of silicon&#8208;based PEC systems, providing a simultaneously passivating and protective strategy for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies under harsh conditions.

         <title>Fused Dual&#8208;Donor Design for Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing Rates of Spatially Folded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A type TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2) with dual&#8208;donor fusion design have been developed, which achieve the accelerated RISC rates (up to 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1) through dense excited&#8208;state engineering, enabling solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high EQEs (23.9%) and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
The development of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT)&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is defective in relatively low reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates (commonly &lt;5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1). Herein, we fuse two 3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IAc) donor units to obtain large planar donors (m&#8208;bIAc and p&#8208;bIAc) for forming spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A configured TSCT emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2). The configuration of highly parallel and large&#8208;plane intramolecular multiple &#960;&#8208;stacking has been achieved. The symmetrical multi&#8208;channel charge transfer networks of emitters induce multiple energetically proximal excited states within a small energy range (&lt;0.12&#160;eV) at the lowest excited state, creating additional configuration interaction and spin&#8208;orbit coupling channels to accelerate the RISC process. This molecular configuration yields enhanced RISC rates of 6.19&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;1 and 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;2. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 18.9% (DCT&#8208;1, 474&#160;nm sky&#8208;blue emission) and 23.9% (DCT&#8208;2, 498&#160;nm green emission), with attenuated efficiency roll&#8208;offs of DCT&#8208;2 (12% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2). This work provides a critical pathway for manipulating dense excited states to address the bottleneck of the RISC rates while maintaining structural rigidity, promoting further advancement of TSCT&#8208;TADF materials.

         <title>The Mechanism of Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#9472;H Arylation of Arenes: The Key Role of Bis&#8208;Cyclometalated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#9472;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes is addressed through experimental stoichiometric, catalytic kinetic, and DFT studies. These reveal a key role for bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species and show bromoarene activation proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition. Bromoarene activation at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species is ruled out.








Abstract
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#8208;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes has been under intense scrutiny over the last decade, with conflicting proposals concerning the relevance of various catalytic intermediates and the nature of the key steps. This work presents experimental and computational studies that address these long&#8208;standing questions. Stoichiometric, catalytic, and mechanistic kinetic studies, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species are key intermediates in these reactions. These studies also show that oxidative addition with bromoarenes proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition pathway, as demonstrated by DFT and experimental kinetic orders. Bromoarene activation does not proceed at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species. In the catalytic process, zero order kinetics are observed on both reaction substrates, an observation that is rationalized by DFT calculations which predict a rate&#8208;limiting step within the product&#8208;release stage. These results showcase how detailed experimental and DFT studies can combine to probe mechanistic questions, as well as resolving opposing views around the mechanism of these Ru&#8208;catalyzed arylations that form the basis of promising mild C&#9472;H functionalizations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Interconversion of Pyridine Dicarbanion&#8208;Bonded Ag13 Nanocluster Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the interplay between solvent environments and structural evolution of in situ formed polynuclear organometallic cluster intermediates. The solvent&#8208;mediated interconversion between two structural isomers reveals distinct stability and reactivity profiles, which stem from solvent&#8208;regulated variations in metal&#8211;metal bonding interactions and adaptive ligand configurations.








Abstract
Solvent screening is pivotal for optimizing metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, yet its impact on the in situ formation and reactivity of polynuclear organometallic clusters remains underexplored. We herein isolate two distinct thirteen&#8208;membered silver cluster isomers, Ag13&#8208;A and Ag13&#8208;M, in acetone and methanol, respectively. Significantly, we demonstrate the interconversion of these isomers facilitated by solvent manipulation. Mechanistic studies on the solvent&#8208;driven Ag13&#8208;A to Ag13&#8208;M transformation reveal this transformation proceeds with a low activation energy (23.39 &#177; 0.81 kcal mol&#8722;1) and positive entropy, involving counter anion dissociation, ligand twisting, and re&#8208;coordination. The observed differences in thermal stability and reactivity between two isomers are attributed to variations in Ag&#8211;Ag interactions and surface ligand arrangements, underscoring the critical role of solvent selection in affecting the whole organic transformation through in situ formed clusters. These results highlight the necessity of considering organometallic cluster intermediates in solvent screening.

         <title>Cooperative Dinuclear Gold Catalysis Unlocking 1,2&#8208;Reductive Elimination Elementary Reaction in Oxidative C&#9472;C Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#160;dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst has been synthesized according to ligand micro&#8208;environmental regulation, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of alkynes and vinyl boron reagents. Computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode for 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination process, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing key intermediates, and provide new opportunities for cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
Cooperative catalysis enabled by dinuclear metal complexes can integrate the catalytic properties of each metal center, thus opening new avenues to achieve challenging reaction selectivity that are difficult to accomplish with mononuclear metal catalysts. Here, we present a cooperative catalysis strategy using a newly synthesized dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of both coupling partners (alkynes and vinyl boron reagents) in the oxidative C&#9472;C coupling. It demonstrates a broad substrate tolerance for both terminal and internal alkynes, providing a versatile platform for the synthesis of enynes and dienes. Mechanistic and computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing the key intermediates, thus promoting C&#9472;C bond formation in an efficient manner. The DFT calculations indicate a less explored 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination elementary step. Interestingly, the use of B(OiPr)3 as an additive can effectively prevent the decomposition of dinuclear gold catalyst under oxidative fluoride&#8208;containing conditions.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks Mediated by Redox&#8208;Responsive Neighboring&#8208;Group&#8208;Participating Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The strong neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) effect of selenium&#8208;bridged bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane bis&#8208;alkyl halide (Se&#8208;BCN) demonstrates great potential as a crosslinker for the synthesis of covalent adaptable networks. The activity of selenium&#8208;based NGP can be regulated by oxidation and reduction of the selenium atom, thus allowing the dynamic performance of such crosslinked networks to be controlled through redox response.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) typically require external catalysts to facilitate efficient crosslinker exchange, which can limit the reprocessability of the network due to leaching and degradation of the catalyst. In this study, the use of catalysts was avoided by employing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (BCN) bis&#8208;alkyl halide crosslinker with selenium&#8208;based neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) to enhance the rate of bond exchange. This thermally mediated C&#9472;N alkyl exchange and the associated flow behavior enabled the intrinsically ionic network (which possesses antimicrobial properties) to be both chemically recycled and repaired and reprocessed under mild conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of the network can be regulated by the reversible redox responsiveness of selenium atoms within the network. This novel type of NGP&#8208;based CAN therefore has the potential to enrich designs for catalyst&#8208;free dynamic networks with high performance and modulated dynamicity.

         <title>Coronal Complexation Induces Snowman&#8208;Shaped Janus Polymersome Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snowman&#8208;like Janus polymersomes were produced in a simple, yet versatile two&#8208;step approach involving a plasticizing agent and a cationic polymer additive to complex with the charged polymersome. Shape transformation was driven by coronal complexation altering membrane structure, followed by segregation of the polymer additive to form a protruding bleb of the Janus polymersome.








Abstract
Engineering polymersome shape is a keen area of interest because minimal variations in polymersome properties can greatly affect the performance of nanoreactors, drug delivery vehicles, and more. Although methods to transform polymersome shapes have been evolving rapidly, limitations remain in the scope of applicable polymersome compositions and adaptability to engineer a desired shape. In this work, we developed a method utilizing cationic polymer additives and coronal complexation to transform charged spherical polymersomes into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. The resulting morphologies feature a hollow polymersome compartment conjoined to a protruding bleb consisting of the complexed polymer additive, which we propose forms via a dewetting process. This methodology provides enhanced shape control through adjustments in additive composition or plasticizer content, offering additional routes to engineering novel polymersome structures.

         <title>Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2${\rm CO}_2$ Electroreduction over Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different regions of the electrode/electrolyte interface, such as the interfacial layer and diffuse double layer, are spectroscopically discerned by analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectra. In this way, discrete events relating to reorientation of water molecules in the double layer are elucidated, which correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO.








Abstract
Understanding the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces and its dynamic evolution, is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$). Despite its postulated significant influence on CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$ activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time&#8208;variance profiles. By analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We provide spectroscopic evidence that these sudden EDL reorganizations correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2${\rm CO}_2$, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice&#8208;like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize, electrochemical&#160;systems.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism for Unconventional Anodic Reaction of Aldehyde Oxidation for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of nonelectrochemical steps and electrochemical steps enables the unconventional anodic reaction of aldehyde oxidation for hydrogen production (AOR&#8208;H2), which is expected to break through the limit of existing energy conversion systems. Additionally,&#160;decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2 because the Pt species favor the electrochemical O&#9472;H bond cleavage.








Abstract
Anodic reactions involving non&#8208;faradaic processes have significantly expanded the potential application of anodic oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Metallic Cu materials can catalyze an unconventional anodic aldehyde oxidation reaction involving the non&#8208;faradaic H2 production (AOR&#8208;H2). AOR&#8208;H2 has distinct advantages of ultra&#8208;low thermodynamic potentials and high value&#8208;added redox products, etc., but the question of exactly how reduction steps occur during AOR&#8208;H2, is something which has long puzzled scientists. Here we illustrate the novel synergistic mechanism of nonelectrochemical/electrochemical redox steps in AOR&#8208;H2. Aldehyde undergoes hydration, deprotonation, and spontaneous C&#8211;H homolytic cleavage to generate H2, and then is electrochemically oxidized to form carboxylate. Decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species, supported by theoretical calculations, leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2. This work inspires researchers to develop novel cathodic and anodic reactions involving the non&#8208;faradaic process for breaking through the limit of existing energy conversion systems.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of WC Powder Electrocatalysts Probed In Situ with NAP&#8208;XPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a highly active catalyst for the HER. The reasons for its activity are, however, unclear due to its delicate susceptibility to oxidation and thus passivation. Electrochemical near ambient pressure XPS reveals dissolution of the passive film into the electrolyte under electrochemical working conditions, which effectively enables the electrocatalyst's enduring activity.








Abstract
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a renowned compound catalyst material for electrochemical water splitting, and its high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been repeatedly reported. However, its susceptibility to oxidation raises the fundamental question of the underlying reason for its high activity, especially since passivation and thus potential deactivation can occur not only in air but also during reaction. Hence, the investigation of the surface chemistry under true operating conditions is crucial for a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic process. In this work, we use electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EC&#8208;XPS) to revisit the surface chemistry of WC powder electrodes in alkaline electrolyte in situ and under full potential control. Our results show that although the surface is initially covered with oxide, this passive film dissolves in the electrolyte under electrochemical reaction conditions. This clarifies the active surface termination during the HER and highlights the potential of laboratory&#8208;based EC&#8208;XPS to study applied energy conversion materials.

         <title>Integrating Multifunctionalities into a 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

By integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich supramolecular cages and porphyrin moieties as well as single&#8208;atomic metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) together, two metalated photoactive covalent organic frameworks are constructed for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is still challenging. Herein, integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich organic cages and the photoactive porphyrin moieties together, a 3D covalent organic framework (COF), Cage&#8208;PorCOF, is successfully synthesized. After incorporating metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) into the cage&#8208;based COF, Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) are subsequently constructed for the CO2 photoreduction. Catalytic experiments show impressive performance in CO2 photoreduction with CO generation rates of up to 48&#160;748 and 28&#160;446&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the first initiating hour for Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni), respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from CO2&#8208;affinity of the porous frameworks and incorporated metal atoms, the light&#8208;absorption and charge separation ability of metalloporphyrin groups as well as the fully exposed single&#8208;atomic catalytic sites confirmed by both experimental and theoretical analyses. This study demonstrates that by the integration of multiple functionalities into 3D porous solids, highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 conversion can be achieved.

         <title>To Make a Painstaking Investigation: Revealing the Electrochemical Reactions in Aqueous Zn&#9472;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition mechanism is not clear. To verify the underlying mechanism, skillfully managing compositional Zn||MnO2 battery, revealing the dual&#8208;discharge platform chemistry due to dissolution reaction rather than Zn2+/H+ intercalation. They influenced by proton concentration and Zn2+ hydrolysis, with Discharge Plateau I driven by excess H+ and Plateau II by Zn2+ hydrolysis.








Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO2&#8208;based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables. The possibility of Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry is ruled out and the dominance of the dissolution/deposition mechanism is strongly demonstrated. This study confirms that the chemistry of the controversial double&#8208;discharge platform is a dissolution reaction, determined by different proton concentrations and zinc ions hydrolysis. Discharge Plateau I is the MnO2 dissolution dominated by the surplus H+ in the electrolyte, while Discharge Plateau II is the smooth discharge plateau resulting from the hydrolysis of Zn2+ releasing protons when the proton concentration decreases to the point of Zn(OH)2 generation. This work provides a better understanding of the dissolution/deposition mechanism of Zn||MnO2 and paves the way for the practical application of manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries. It also provides a comprehensive method to study the mechanism of electrochemical reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolution/deposition and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables. The possibility of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation chemistry is ruled out and the dominance of the dissolution/deposition mechanism is strongly demonstrated. This study confirms that the chemistry of the controversial double-discharge platform is a dissolution reaction, determined by different proton concentrations and zinc ions hydrolysis. Discharge Plateau I is the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolution dominated by the surplus H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte, while Discharge Plateau II is the smooth discharge plateau resulting from the hydrolysis of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; releasing protons when the proton concentration decreases to the point of Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.

         <title>Precise Engineering of Asymmetric Tri&#8208;Active Sites by Symbiotic Strategy for Photocontrolled Directional Reforming of Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

A symbiotic strategy is proposed by DFT predictions for the rational design of CuxTiO2 SACs. The Cu SAs are introduced to form an asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ti structure, which significantly enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and HMF on the catalyst. This strategy achieves the targeted oxidation of HMF to DFF and FDCA through effective microenvironmental modulation.








Abstract
Sunlight&#8208;driven production of high&#8208;value chemicals from renewable resources represents a pivotal driver toward achieving sustainable energy supply. However, fundamental barriers include inadequate use of light energy and insufficient understanding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating mechanisms in photocatalytic processes. To address this, a novel symbiotic strategy for the design of Cux/TiO2 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations was proposed. The developed catalyst achieved nearly 100% conversion and selectivity for the directional photooxidative transformation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) or 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under both vis&#8208;light and UV&#8211;vis light conditions. Importantly, compared to previous works, this catalyst exhibited the highest photooxidation activity reported to date while effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of HMF to CO2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that rational construction of Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) could effectively create the asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ti structure, which significantly enhanced the activation of O2 and HMF, facilitating generation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) and Ti3+. Furthermore, Cu SAs served as hole (h+) extractors in the photooxidation process, promoting rapid charge carrier transfer and ROS formation. The applicability of this developed strategy was further demonstrated for photooxidative conversion of various bio&#8208;feedstocks, including HMF and alcoholic substrates, indicating its great potential for harnessing light energy for sustainable valorization of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals.

A strategy to construct pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator by ordered co&#8208;assembly of block copolymer and metal&#8208;organic framework is proposed to sequentially combine zincophilic and zincophobic properties. Multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure accelerates zinc migration and desolvation processes, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling stability to 1900 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 5200 cycles.








Abstract
Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator is constructed by kinetics&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembly of zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure that accelerates adsorption, pre&#8208;desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite&#8208;free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 h (31&#160;mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long&#8208;cycling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Scalable and Ultrathin Dual Entangled Network Polymer Electrolytes for Safe Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

A 9.7&#160;&#181;m ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;network polymer electrolyte with a decent voltage tolerance, improved tensile strength, and higher thermal stability was manufactured for safer sodium&#8208;metal batteries, in which the ether&#8208;oxygen segments were complexed with sodium ions, and the electronegative channels formed by the carbonyl and cyanogen groups acted as sodium ion transport channels to accelerate ion migration.








Abstract
Identifying ultrathin and flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance is crucial for scale&#8208;up production of solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) metal batteries (SSMBs). However, the challenges of poor processing scalability, insufficient intrinsic mechanical strength, and limited ionic transport capacity remain unaddressed. Herein, an ultrathin 9.7&#160;&#181;m solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane featuring a dual&#8208;polymer entangled network is meticulously engineered through an arrayed multi&#8208;nozzle electrospinning technique with a swelling and hot pressing process using polyacrylonitrile and poly(ether&#8208;block&#8208;amide), which exhibits an exceptional voltage tolerance, enhanced tensile strength, and superior thermal stability. The soft ether oxygens segments in multiblock copolymers complex with Na+ to promote the rapid hopping transport of Na+. Meanwhile, interconnected electronegative channels based on carbonyl and cyanogen groups serve as Na+ conduits to smooth ion fluctuations and accelerate Na+ selective conduction simultaneously. The obtained inorganic&#8208;organic composite solid electrolyte interface with the improved mechanical strength of ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolytes effectively suppresses Na dendrites with low overpotential over 500&#160;h. The solid&#8208;state cells paired with layered oxides deliver a capacity retention of over 91.1% between 25&#160;&#176;C and 65&#160;&#176;C, and assembled pouch cells exhibit impressive energy density over 100 cycles, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale application of ultrathin structure in the SSMBs.

         <title>Synergistic C&#9472;N Coupling for Efficient Cyclohexanone Oxime Synthesis from Ambient Air by Supported Molecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular catalyst is demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions. The mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity are the best known to date in H&#8208;cell. The whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal the intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH catalytic reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The unprecedented results obtained offer an ideal platform for the benign, economical, and sustainable production of cyclohexanone oxime as an alternative to the current existing processes. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unraveling atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms and managing selective C&#9472;N coupling still pose great challenges to realizing considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C&#9472;N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. In the present work, molecular catalysts are demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e., iron bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP (multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber paper) cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2&#8722; and cyclohexanone, attaining mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H&#8208;cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and catalyzed selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The in&#8208;depth understanding of substrate&#8208;catalyst interactions and synergic C&#9472;N coupling from molecular points of view offers valuable insights to boost collaborative synthesis of organic nitrogen compounds. Further integrating plasma&#8208;driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 on the FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode, and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.

         <title>Guideline for Analysis and Prevention of Contamination Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Ongoing efforts to discover new catalysts in coupling reactions have provided an effective toolkit for chemists over the last decades. However, metal impurities often lead to costly misinterpretations and reproducibility issues. Our guideline provides a practical roadmap for identifying true catalysts, eliminating impurity&#8208;driven errors, and ensuring reliable research outcomes. Designed primarily for handling trace metal challenges, this framework sets a new standard for robust, impurity&#8208;free catalyst discovery. 








Abstract
Over the last decades, numerous efforts have been made to replace metal catalysts with cheaper and earth&#8208;abundant alternatives or to completely exclude metals from cross&#8208;coupling reactions while maintaining high efficiency in the target transformation. However, follow&#8208;up studies often revealed the role of metal impurities in the catalytic process. Thus, active metal impurities can lead to mechanistic misinterpretations, and these could initiate erroneous research directives and lead to severe reproducibility problems. Milestone precedents of the impurity effect in cross&#8208;coupling reactions are well documented in the literature. Interestingly, this fallacy has reoccurred repeatedly over the years due to a lack of thorough mechanistic studies and appropriate research study schemes for identifying impurity effects. Herein, we propose a guideline to elucidate the real catalyst of future catalytic transformations, aiming to reveal the correct mechanism and help exclude the role of impurities in novel catalytic processes. Although this guideline mainly focuses on problems related to trace transition metals, it also offers the basis for more general catalyst research.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chemoselectivity in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Pentafulvenes via (2+2+1) Alkyne Cyclotrimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of pentafulvenes with varied substituents has been efficiently achieved using novel rhodium&#8208;based catalysts via (2+2+1) alkyne cyclotrimerization. A rational design of the catalyst structure, including pyridonato, NHC and CO ligands, ensure the alkyne chemoselectivity and prevents the formation of robust rhodium&#8208;fulvene species. Furthermore, the judicious choice of acidity and steric properties of different alkynes enables the preparation of cross&#8208;coupled fulvene derivatives. Stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations, shed light on the reaction mechanism, showing that it includes an initial alkyne deprotonation, two successive alkyne insertions, cyclization, and protonolysis, the first insertion being the rate&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Edge Sites Engineering on Amorphous Co&#8208;Mn Spinel&#8208;Based Oxides for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational modulation of edge active sites in the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers, is a hot topic in the heterogeneous catalysis field, yet the applicability of large&#8208;scale manufacturing remains a severe challenge. Herein, a general wet&#8208;chemical approach is reported to large&#8208;scale prepare porous CoMn2O4 with abundant active edge sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like activation without using a template or heat treatment. The obtained Turing&#8208;type structure not only can be assembled into spatially restricted domain CoMn2O4 nanoreactors but also greatly facilitates the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies in promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant non&#8208;radical (1O2) pathways and maintained a degradation rate of 99.8% within 5 minutes after seven&#8208;cycle runs. Moreover, the application prospect of the PMS&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like process for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment, including sulfadiazine (SD) antibiotics in real river water and real pharmaceutical wastewater, was demonstrated by the fixed&#8208;bed tower reactor and the in&#8208;situ floating water treatment device. This work will provide guidance for the development of low&#8208;cost and efficient heterogeneous PMS&#8208;activation catalysts through rational defect engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Steric Bulk into Silylboranes: Enhanced Bench Stability and Novel Chemical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silylboranes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, and a wide range of structural variants of silylboranes have already been synthesized. However, the stability of silylboranes varies significantly, and their decomposition mechanism remains to be fully understood. Moreover, some silylborane motifs have not yet been applied as synthetic reagents due to their instability. To address this issue, we first investigated the decomposition mechanism of silylboranes in air and moisture using experimental and theoretical methods. We discovered that oxygenation by atmospheric oxygen is the major decomposition pathway, resulting in the formation of a borylsilylether, and that the introduction of a bulky silyl group suppresses this decomposition. Based on these results, we synthesized triisopropylsilyldimesitylborane (i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2), which exhibits high bench stability. Moreover, i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2 reacts with carbon monoxide (CO), which is the first example for a reaction between a silylborane and CO. Further computational studies revealed that electronic effects, including hyperconjugation between the Si&#8211;B &#963;&#8208;bond and C&#8211;O &#960;*&#8208;bond, are crucial for CO activation. Furthermore, we prepared a bench&#8208;stable bissilylaminoborane by introducing triisopropylsilyl groups, providing a bissilylchloroborane upon hydrogen chloride treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into how steric and electronic effects can be used to optimize the balance between stability and reactivity in silylboranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Atom&#8211;Cluster Synergistic Modification with Tuned d&#8208;band Center Imparts Longevous Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tailored nucleation and growth of potassium metal over a current collector is essential to realize longevous potassium metal anodes. The commercial current collector lacks sufficient nucleation sites and fails to guide uniform deposition, underscoring the request for interfacial modulation maneuvers. Herein, we develop transition metal atom&#8211;cluster moiety decorated N&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanosphere to modify the Al current collector. In a Fe model system, the Fe single atoms provide high surface energy and fast charge transfer, while Fe clusters serve as local electron reservoirs. This cooperative architecture manages to tune the d&#8208;band center, accordingly promoting the potassium capture and minimizing the nucleation overpotential to merely 4 mV. Theoretical simulations and in situ microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations evidence that the synergistic modification markedly accelerates potassium plating/stripping kinetics, enabling prolonged symmetric&#8208;cell cycling (approaching 3000 h) and stabilized full&#8208;cell performance (0.022% decay rate per cycle over 2000 cycles). This strategy could be extended to other transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, Cu), offering a paradigm for atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering towards reversible alkali metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Coherently Coupled Frustrated Lewis Pairs in In2O3&#8722;x Nanoclusters for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;catalysts integration presents unique opportunities to enhance photoactivity, yet selectivity control and mechanistic understanding within multistep reactions remain fundamental challenges hitherto. In this study, a reshaped kinetic landscape is demonstrated over coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on carbon nitride matrix, which mediates directed CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion with a selectivity of 65.3% (electron basis). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded interface fosters intimate electronic coupling, generating built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate cascade charge transfer processes. Particularly, exceptionally robust FLPs sites were identified within the sub&#8208;nanosized In2O3&#8208;x nanoclusters, in contrast to easily deactivated counterparts in oversized crystalline structures. These enduring FLPs sites confer privileged adaptive binding with CO2 and mutative C1 intermediates. Correlated in situ infrared and mass spectroscopic analyses track the formation of FLPs&#8208;CO2 adducts and highlight the predominance of formate (HCOO&#8722;) pathway, surpassing competitive CO evolution. This work opens inspiring prospects for exploring multielectron photochemistry and achievable metrics through distinctive FLPs topologies on sub&#8208;nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance FeP Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Recovery via Joule&#8208;Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited high&#8208;surface&#8208;area FeP is introduced as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst for nitrate reduction in alkaline media. Exploiting the high stability of the catalyst in alkaline media, a novel Joule&#8208;stripping strategy is implemented to recover the produced ammonia as solid ammonium salt, using the heat generated at high current densities to directly volatilize and separate in situ formed ammonia from the aqueous solution. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO&#8323;RR) offers a promising route for decentralized and sustainable ammonia production while addressing environmental challenges associated with nitrate pollution. However, the development of practical implementations has been slowed by the challenge of creating highly stable and selective catalysts for strongly basic environments, along with the difficulty of efficiently recovering ammonia from dilute solutions. Here, we introduce a partially oxidized amorphous iron&#8208;phosphide (POA&#8208;FeP) electrocatalyst that combines high activity and stability with an innovative Joule&#8208;stripping strategy for ammonia recovery. Electrodeposited onto nickel foam (NF), the POA&#8208;FeP catalyst achieves benchmark partial current densities of &#8722;720&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and &#8722;932&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, and near quantitative Faradaic efficiencies (FE). The robustness of the POA&#8208;FeP/NF catalyst was highlighted by its ability to maintain FE above 90% during continuous operation for over 1000 h at a total current density of &#8722;300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. We demonstrate that the Joule heating resulting from the operation of the electrolyzer at high current density can be exploited to induce the volatilization of ammonia, which can then be recovered as solid ammonium chloride with &gt;95% yield. This integrated Joule&#8208;stripping approach simplifies ammonia recovery and opens up new possibilities for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrate reduction systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Cathode Constructed Solely by Carbon Dots for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have been explored widely in the electrochemistry field owing to their unique structures and rich properties. However, in the reported devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, CDs are always used as additives to modify the electrodes or regulate the electrolytes, because they have been regarded as inert and low&#8208;capacity materials all along. Here for the first time, o&#8208;phenylenediamine derived CDs are selected as the only protagonist to construct cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such CDs (p&#8208;CDs) have a special &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenazine&#8208;based structure, with carbon cores for electrical conductivity and active sites for embedding Zn2+ and H+. The p&#8208;CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a decent capacity of 290 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and a superior capacity of 103 mAh g&#8208;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 10 A g&#8208;1, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&#8208;8 ~ 10&#8208;7 cm2 s&#8208;1. The p&#8208;CDs assembled ZIBs exhibits a stable long&#8208;term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron&#8208;deficient N as the active sites on p&#8208;CDs can embed/release Zn2+ and H+ reversibly.</dc:description>

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral Paracyclophanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative (dynamic) kinetic resolution of racemic paracyclophanols catalysed by a chiral isothiourea (5 mol%) is described (up to s&#160;=&#160;50 at 49% conversion or up to 98:2 er and 96% yield in 30 examples). Rotational barriers were analysed for paracyclophanols and selected ester products.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the catalytic enantioselective preparation of planar chiral paracyclophane derivatives is of considerable interest to the synthetic community. To date, relatively few successful and effective organocatalytic approaches to this molecular class have been reported. This manuscript describes effective isothiourea catalysed acylative kinetic (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to the generation of a range of planar chiral paracyclophane macrocycles with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. Effective KR of configurationally stable planar chiral paracyclophanols with 12&#8208; and 13&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains is demonstrated (6 examples, s&#160;=&#160;up to 50) using 5 mol% of the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM and isobutyric anhydride. Application to configurationally labile macrocyclic phenols with 14 to 18&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains allows their effective acylative DKR, generating the desired products with excellent enantioselectivity (25 examples, up to 95% yield and 98:2 er).

         <title>A Strong and Tough Thermosetting Epoxy Resin for Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research develops a strong and tough thermosetting epoxy resin by integrating dynamic ester bonds into semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks. The epoxy resin demonstrates superior tensile strength of 123&#160;MPa and record&#8208;breaking impact strength of 52.3&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, making it ideal for high&#8208;performance on fiber&#8208;reinforced composites. Moreover, the embedded tertiary amines accelerate transesterification reactions, enabling closed&#8208;loop recycling of composites in water. 








Abstract
Epoxy&#8208;based carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (EP&#8208;CFRCs) are appealing for engineering applications due to their exceptional specific strength and modulus. Nevertheless, the intrinsic brittleness and limited recyclability of highly cross&#8208;linked epoxy matrices pose significant challenges to their sustainable development. Herein, we present an approach combining dynamic ester bonds with semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) to overcome these challenges. This strategy leverages the crosslinked epoxy network to resist deformation, while hydrogen bonds and entangled SIPNs to facilitate energy dissipation, enhancing both strength and toughness. The resultant epoxy matrix exhibits superior tensile strength of 123&#160;MPa and record&#8208;breaking impact strength of 52.3&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, effectively overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness in thermosets. This balanced performance renders it a promising matrix for high&#8208;performance EP&#8208;CFRCs, which display a tensile strength of 718&#160;MPa and a bending deflection of 0.59&#160;mm. Moreover, the embedded tertiary amines accelerate transesterification reactions, enabling closed&#8208;loop recycling of EP&#8208;CFRCs in water. The recycled carbon fibers and the degraded matrix can be reused in new composites and adhesives. This work presents a simple yet effective strategy for designing epoxy resin&#8208;based composites that overcome the limitations of traditional matrices and support the development of recyclable advanced materials for diverse industrial applications.

         <title>A Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Graphenic Buckybowl for Photocatalysis and Assembly With Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) is bent to a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl (3N&#8208;HBC) through the incorporation of only three pentagons. The electron&#8208;donating nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of 3N&#8208;HBC enable its assembly with fullerenes (C60 and C70), and make it the first bowl&#8208;shaped organic photocatalyst that can be used to convert 2&#8208;isocyanobiphenyl to phenanthridine derivatives under blue LEDs irradiation at 1.0 mol% catalytic loading.








Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;containing graphenic buckybowl (3N&#8208;HBC) has been synthesized through pentagonal cyclization at the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (p&#8208;HBC) using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative cycloamination as a key step. The incorporation of three pyrrole rings to the periphery of the bowl endows it with strong electron&#8208;rich character, showing three reversible oxidations in cyclic voltammetry (CV), and thus could be progressively oxidized into cationic radical and high&#8208;charged species upon gradual addition of the oxidant. Interestingly, the cationic radical was also generated by acids, which could be significantly accelerated by light, whether under an air or inert atmosphere. 3N&#8208;HBC exhibits interesting properties that arise from its electron&#8208;rich character and the unique curved geometry. 3N&#8208;HBC proved to be a superior organic photocatalyst for the conversion of 2&#8208;isocyanobiphenyl to phenanthridine derivatives at 1.0 mol% catalytic loading under blue LEDs irradiation. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;donating nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of 3N&#8208;HBC enable its association with fullerenes (C60 and C70) in solution and solid states. This work also demonstrates that nanographene sheets can be bent to &#960;&#8208;bowls through the introduction of a few pentagons containing small&#8208;sized heteroatoms to their bay regions.

         <title>[TeSeS2]2&#8722;: The First Heterotriple&#8208;Chalcogenide Motifs Decode Giant Mid&#8208;Far Infrared Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating S, Se, and Te, the first heterotri&#8208;chalcogenide motif, [TeSeS2]2&#8722;, is created in BaTeSeS2. It harmonizes ultrabroad IR transmission (&gt;25&#160;&#181;m) with giant optical anisotropy (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.55 at 550&#160;nm), outperforming all commercial birefringent crystals and reported IR birefringent materials.








Abstract
Optical anisotropy, a cornerstone of polarization control, presents fundamental challenge in functional optical material design due to the intricate interplay between its regulation mechanisms and performance optimization. The development of mid&#8208;far infrared (MFIR) birefringent crystals has long been shackled by the incompatibility between giant optical anisotropy and ultrabroad transparency in conventional chalcogenides. Here, we break this shackle via heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide engineering in the first thiotellurite birefringent family, BaTeQ3 (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se), featuring isolated [TeQ3]2&#8315; motifs. BaTeS3 achieves a large experimental birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.193@550&#160;nm, 15&#215; commercial MgF2). More strikingly, the assembly of three distinct Group VIA chalcogens (S, Se, Te) creates the first heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide motif&#8212;[TeSeS2]2&#8315; in BaTeSeS2, delivering giant &#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.55@550&#160;nm&#8212;a 284% increase from BaTeS3 and surpassing all commercial benchmarks. BaTeSeS2 concurrently exhibit ultrabroad transparency (0.5&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m), overcoming the classical trade&#8208;off between anisotropy and transparency. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that their extraordinary optical anisotropy stems from synergistic stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP)&#8208;driven electron localization in [TeQ3]2&#8722; units (electron localization function&#160;&gt;&#160;0.8) and Se&#8208;induced pyramidal distortion. The pioneering [TeSeS&#8322;]2&#8315; heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide motif establishes a transformative design paradigm, which not only redefines the materials motifs for giant MFIR birefringence but also unlocks unprecedented opportunities in next&#8208;generation infrared lasers, polarizers, and quantum communication devices.

         <title>Axial&#8208;N Induced Square&#8208;Pyramidal Crystal Filed of Atomically Iron Sites for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axial&#8208;N ligand in the atomically dispersed Fe sites induces a square&#8208;pyramidal crystal field, which could promote the acidic oxygen reduction activity and stability for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The evolved FeN3O2 and FeN4O1 structures for the optimal FeN5 configuration during the reaction process could further accelerate the ORR kinetics.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;based catalyst represents a promising alternative to platinum for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the prevalent FeN4 configuration exhibits limited intrinsic activity in acidic media owing to its inherent instability, thereby restricting its application in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, we introduce axial&#8208;N coordination to enhance the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Fe sites for acidic ORR by establishing a barrier to prevent Fe dissolution. Compared to the FeN4 configuration, the axial&#8208;N ligand in the FeN5, FeN5&#8208;Fe3, and FeN2C3 configurations induces a square&#8208;pyramidal crystal field, which diminishes the spin polarization in the dz2, dxz, and dyz orbitals, and alters the electronic delocalization of Fe atom. In a 0.10&#160;M HClO4 electrolyte, the ORR activity increases with enhanced electronic delocalization, following the trend: FeN5&gt;FeN5+Fe3&gt;FeN2C3&gt;FeN4. Operando technique further reveals that the dissociation of Fe&#9472;N bond in the FeN5 configuration occurs alongside the insertion of oxygen, leading to the formation of FeN3O2 and FeN4O1 structures that could accelerate the ORR kinetics. Consequently, the FeN5 configuration shows a positive shift of 30&#160;mV in half&#8208;wave potential compared to Pt/C and achieves a peak power of 1.2&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 3.2 A cm&#8722;2 in PEMFC.

     alt="Axial-N Induced Square-Pyramidal Crystal Filed of Atomically Iron Sites for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The axial-N ligand in the atomically dispersed Fe sites induces a square-pyramidal crystal field, which could promote the acidic oxygen reduction activity and stability for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The evolved FeN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structures for the optimal FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration during the reaction process could further accelerate the ORR kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed Fe-based catalyst represents a promising alternative to platinum for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the prevalent FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration exhibits limited intrinsic activity in acidic media owing to its inherent instability, thereby restricting its application in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, we introduce axial-N coordination to enhance the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Fe sites for acidic ORR by establishing a barrier to prevent Fe dissolution. Compared to the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, the axial-N ligand in the FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; and FeN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; configurations induces a square-pyramidal crystal field, which diminishes the spin polarization in the d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, and alters the electronic delocalization of Fe atom. In a 0.10&#160;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte, the ORR activity increases with enhanced electronic delocalization, following the trend: FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;+Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Operando technique further reveals that the dissociation of Fe&#9472;N bond in the FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration occurs alongside the insertion of oxygen, leading to the formation of FeN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structures that could accelerate the ORR kinetics. Consequently, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration shows a positive shift of 30&#160;mV in half-wave potential compared to Pt/C and achieves a peak power of 1.2&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in PEMFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Functionalization of Benzene Ring via Carbene&#8208;Initiated [4,5]&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although conventional carbene&#8208;mediated [2,3]&#8208;rearrangements focus on divalent functionalization of the carbene center, this study introduces an unprecedented carbene&#8208;initiated [4,5]&#8208;rearrangement cascade, which enables para&#8208;selective functionalization or dearomatizing functionalization of benzene rings. Three distinct product architectures are generated depending on the substituent groups.








Abstract
The extreme similarity in electronic and steric reactivity among the C&#9472;H bonds present on alkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic rings presents a formidable challenge when it comes to achieving high selectivity during the para&#8208;selective functionalization of these bonds. This article presents a unique study that delves into the para&#8208;selective functionalization or dearomatization functionalization of benzene rings, achieved through the reaction of carbenes with allyl sulfoxides. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the transformation likely proceeds via an uncommon carbene&#8208;mediated [4,5]&#8208;rearrangement process.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced C&#9472;C Cleavage and Site&#8208;Specific Hydrogenation of a Highly Strained Bilayer Spironanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a reduction&#8208;induced ring cleavage with subsequent hydrogenation of a bilayer spironanographene upon treatment with alkali metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggested localized spin density on the C&#8208;atom at the central spirocycle upon one&#8208;fold reduction, facilitating a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation. The pronounced gain in aromaticity of the system also favored the formation of the hydrogenated product.








Abstract
The chemical reduction of a bilayer spironanographene, spiro&#8208;NG (C137H120), with Na and K metals in the presence of [2.2.2]cryptand to yield [Na+(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)](C137H121&#8722;) (1) and [K+(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)](C137H121&#8722;) (2), respectively, is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals the formation of a new &#8220;naked&#8221; anion (spiro&#8208;NGH&#8722;), in which spirocyclic ring cleavage and subsequent hydrogenation have occurred. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the generation of the radical anion of the parent nanographene (spiro&#8208;NG&#8226;&#8722;), upon electron acceptance from Na and K metals, induces the cleavage of the strained spirobifluorene core. The resulting spin density localizes on a particular carbon atom, previously attached to the spiranic sp3 carbon atom, facilitating a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation to afford (spiro&#8208;NGH&#8722;). The electrostatic potential map of this anion reveals electron density concentrated at the five&#8208;membered ring of the readily formed indenyl fragment, thus enhancing the aromaticity of the system. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy experiments allowed to follow the in situ reduction and hydrogenation processes in detail.

         <title>Reactivity of a Methylene&#8208;Bridged 1,3&#8208;Bis(germylene) in Dynamic Equilibrium with Its Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, it undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene derivative (Ge4CHD). Moreover, theoretical calculations on Ge4CHD reveal &#963;*&#8208;&#960; interactions between the two &#960; orbitals (Ge=Ge) and the CH &#963;* orbital. This interaction is confirmed by a significant red shift in the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum. In contrast to the behavior in the solid state, the Ge4CHD derivative dissociates in solution into a methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative.  The resultant 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with S8 to form a novel cage compound containing three S and two Ge atoms. On the other hand, in the reaction with triphenylphosphine sulfide, the in&#8208;situ generated 2&#8208;thia&#8208;1,3&#8208;digermabicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivative activat&#173;ed the benzene solvent, leading to the formation of a [2+2] cycloaddition product. Additionally, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#173;pyridine (DMAP) to form a three&#8208;membered ring. Its structural parameters and the results of theoretical calculations indicated the zwitterionic character.</dc:description>

The reactions operate under mild conditions without transition metal catalysts and sacrificial electrodes, providing an efficient avenue for the direct conversion of feedstock alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176;) and ketones directly to valuable organosilanes.








Abstract
Alcohols and ketones are abundant and structurally diverse feedstocks, yet their direct transformation into organosilicon compounds remains challenging due to the difficulty in selective cleaving C&#9472;OH and C&#9552;O bonds. Here, we report an electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy that converts alcohols and ketones directly to organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without external redox reagents and sacrificial electrodes. A wide range of alcohols, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, as well as ketones, are efficiently converted to the corresponding organosilane products. Overall, this study provides a step&#8208;economical, highly efficient, and synthetically versatile platform for the direct conversion of feedstock chemicals into valuable organosilicon compounds.

         <title>A Combined Aptamer Pulldown&#8208;DNAzyme Cleavage Assay for Intact Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid fluorescence and lateral flow assays were developed for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) by combining a DNA aptamer for selective isolation and an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme for detection of MRSA.








Abstract
Accurate and convenient detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) plays a vital role in determining appropriate antibiotic interventions. Herein, we report the first example combining a DNA aptamer and an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme (RCD) that bind different protein markers for selective preconcentration and detection of MRSA. An aptamer for the penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a) was generated by in vitro selection and was coupled to agarose beads to allow rapid pull down of intact MRSA cells from complex samples. A previously reported RCD for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was then used to detect a second proteinaceous marker within the lysed cells based on a protein&#8208;activated cleavage reaction that was linked to both fluorescence and lateral flow assays, allowing for selective detection of MRSA over methicillin sensitive SA. An optimized LFD assay could detect &#8764;103&#160;cfu mL&#8722;1 of MRSA in either nasal mucus or serum with a total assay time of 1&#160;h using minimal sample processing.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Electron Donation at the Sulfoximidoyl Nitrogen Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based evidence for a strong positive mesomeric effect (+M&#8208;effect) of the sulfoximidoyl group at N is presented. Our findings contrast with common characterizations of the sulfoximidoyl group as an exclusively electron&#8208;withdrawing moiety. The implications for reactivity are discussed, and it is demonstrated that the +M&#8208;effect explains experimental observations in the field of sulfoximine chemistry.








Abstract
Knowledge of the physicochemical properties and the reactivity of functional groups is invaluable in organic chemistry. Although substantial understanding of properties/reactivities exists for standard functional groups, moieties which have entered the chemist's toolbox more recently are often not as well characterized. Sulfoximines constitute such a class of recently strongly promoted compounds, which nowadays have emerged as relevant molecules in an industrial context and in academic research. However, theoretical studies on the properties of the sulfoximidoyl group remain sparse. The aim of the present work was to investigate the interactions of the sulfoximidoyl nitrogen lone pairs with adjacent &#960;&#8208;acceptor orbitals. Density functional theory&#8208;based (DFT&#8208;based) methods were employed throughout the investigation to quantify the strength of these interactions and to characterize their influence on the properties/reactivities of N&#8208;functionalized sulfoximines. Although sulfoximines are commonly characterized as electron&#8208;withdrawing, our analysis suggests a strong positive mesomeric effect of the sulfoximidoyl group at nitrogen. This effect increases the basicity and nucleophilicity of conjugated substituents at the sulfoximidoyl nitrogen atom.

         <title>Photothermal CuS as a Hole Transfer Layer on BiVO4 Photoanode for Efficient Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a robust strategy to incorporate a photothermal CuS hole transfer layer between the BiVO4 photoanode and NiFeCoOx cocatalyst for remarkably enhancing PEC water splitting. Photothermal CuS HTL significantly acilitates hole transfer and accelerates water oxidation kinetics by elevating photoanode temperature in situ. The BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode achieves a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;VRHE and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 7.17% when connected in series with Si solar cells.








Abstract
Sluggish hole transport kinetics are one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, severely impeding the attainment of high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. Herein, a copper sulfide (CuS) hole transfer layer (HTL) with photothermal effect is reported to markedly enhance the PEC water splitting via the synergistic action of photothermal effect and hole transfer. This is demonstrated in the BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode, where the CuS layer establishes a transport channel for photogenerated holes, effectively inhibiting charge recombination and trapping. Additionally, the thermal effect induced by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhances the water oxidation activity of the surface NiFeCoOx cocatalyst and boosts the charge mobility. The optimized BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and a STH conversion efficiency of 7.17% when connected in series with Si solar cells. Experimental analyzes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations collectively reveal the pivotal role of CuS HTL in facilitating carrier separation and transport. This work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering to facilitate charge separation and transfer, providing a new strategy for the construction of photoanodes to achieve efficient water splitting.

         <title>Phototransposition of Indazoles to Benzimidazoles: Tautomer&#8208;Dependent Reactivity, Wavelength Dependence, and Continuous Flow Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several N2&#8208;substituted indazole derivatives efficiently undergo photorearrangement to benzimidazoles with UVB irradiation. Motivated by the difference between the wavelength at which the phototransposition is most efficient and the substrate absorbance &#955;max, a photochemical action plot was constructed. Wavelength&#8208;dependent quantum yields were measured, and a photoflow protocol was established to perform the phototransposition on preparative scale.








Abstract
Herein, we report a detailed investigation of the photomediated transformation of indazoles to benzimidazoles through a nitrogen&#8211;carbon transposition. This phototransposition is known to occur in low yield when 1H&#8208;indazoles are subjected to high&#8208;energy UVC irradiation. The 2H&#8208;tautomer of indazole absorbs light more strongly than the 1H&#8208;tautomer at longer wavelengths. We leveraged this improved absorbance profile to develop a general system for the high&#8208;yielding conversion of N2&#8208;derivatized indazoles (prepared from the corresponding 1H&#8208;indazoles) to the corresponding benzimidazoles under UVB or UVA irradiation in up to 98% yield. Investigation of the substrate scope revealed a strong correlation between reaction yield and electron density at N2 of the indazole substrate, suggesting the importance of the availability of the lone pair at this position for reaction efficiency. In addition, evaluation of wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity through the generation of a photochemical action plot revealed that the highest conversion does not only occur at the substrate's maximum absorbance wavelength but also on its red&#8208;side, enabling the use of longer wavelength irradiation to achieve high yields. Building on these insights, a continuous flow protocol was established that enables the phototransposition on preparative scale.

         <title>Multifunctional and Radii&#8208;Matched High&#8208;Entropy Engineering Toward Locally&#8208;Regulable Metal Oxide Layers in Sodium&#8208;Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed HEO cathode relieves the dissolution of transition metal ions and the exfoliation of transition metal oxide layer by virtue of the appropriate six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii. The multielement doping also modify the localization of electrons and enhance the structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides, one of the most fascinating cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have appropriate voltage window and feasible preparation process, however, cycling stability is the biggest challenge. Element doping is the most rational strategy to address this problem, but six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii and different radii in different valence states of these doping elements and the functions of these elements need to be taken into account. Hence, an example of P2/O3&#8208;type Na0.7Mn0.53Ni0.26Fe0.15Mg0.01V0.01Co0.01Cu0.01Zn0.01Sn0.01O2 (high&#8208;entropy&#8208;doped layered oxides, HEO) has been designed in consideration of moderate six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii and stabling the metal&#8211;oxygen bond. A reversible capacity of 126.9 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved. Even tested at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1, an improved rate performance of 72.9 mAh g&#8722;1 can be observed with a capacity retention rate of 66.5% after 1000 cycles. Potential&#8208;based in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and corresponding distribution of relaxation time profiles prove the effect of multiple elemental combination. Concomitantly, in situ XRD results reveal the P2/O3 biphasic clamping reaction mechanism of HEO. Density functional theory results reveal that the multielement doping can modify the localization of electrons and enhance the structural stability. This work provides an idea of designing HEO cathode for SIBs by crystal structure modulation.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioconvergent C&#9472;O Bond Formation for Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Coupling of Allylamines and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of the C1&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligand with copper induced an additional C&#9472;N axial chirality, thereby enhancing stereochemical control in the challenging asymmetric CO2 fixation. This result may establish a new paradigm for developing metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations. 








Abstract
Upgrading abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value organic molecules has garnered broad research interest for decades. Within this domain, catalytic asymmetric synthesis employing CO2 holds great synthetic importance. Although remarkable advances have been made in asymmetric C&#9472;C bond formation using CO2 as a C1 synthon in recent years, the development of incorporation of CO2 as an oxygen source for asymmetric C&#9472;O bond construction remains elusive, presumably due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously addressing enantioselectivity control and reaction efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the first copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;O bond cross&#8208;coupling of allylamines and CO2 in a radical strategy. The key innovation resides in the rational and strategic conversion of C2&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligands to their C1&#8208;symmetric counterparts, which induces additional C&#9472;N axial chirality after coordination with copper. The resultant enantioenriched fluoroalkylated 2&#8208;oxazolidones can be further transformed into diverse functional compounds, including novel chiral amino alcohols for oxazoline ligand design and a potent bioactive insecticide analogue. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway and establish the critical role of C1&#8208;symmetric ligands in achieving efficient stereochemical control.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Clamps for the Passive Cell Diffusion of DNA and siRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized molecular clamps based on guanine and phenylalanine that have the ability to form chiral supramolecular fibers in DMSO and water mixtures and passively help carry genetic material into cells. They form stable structures and deliver DNA and RNA effectively, which could improve the future application of personalized medicine.








Abstract
The safe and effective delivery of DNA and RNA therapeutics continues to be a major hurdle toward personalized medicine, mainly due to the digestion of this genetic material during endosomal uptake. Herein, we designed a hydrophobic nonionic urea&#8208;linked molecular clamp (mol&#8208;clamp) based on guanine and phenylalanine (GFUFG) that can readily complex nucleic acids and transport them into cells through passive diffusion. The optimal chiral self&#8208;assembled state was achieved by controlling the dimethyl sulfoxide to water ratio in the solvent mixture. Dictated by the presence of hydrophobic moieties in the mol&#8208;clamp, a secondary structure was formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The negatively charged complex of mol&#8208;clamped nucleic acids was delivered in high efficiency as indicated by the signal of fluorescently labeled ssDNA to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The actual efficacy of GFUFG was further evaluated by delivering functional single&#8208;stranded DNA (DNAzyme) and siRNA (si&#8208;BCL&#8208;2), which downregulated EGR&#8208;1 and BCL&#8208;2 by 44% and 53%, respectively. We envisage that designing mol&#8208;clamps that can effectively complex genetic materials and promote passive diffusion rather than endocytosis can improve the field of biologics delivery for individualized therapy and cellular engineering.

         <title>A Universal Metal Ion&#8208;Targeting Coordination Strategy for Precise Synthesis of Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal and controllable &#8220;metal ion targeting coordination&#8221; (MITC) strategy for the precise synthesis of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs). By constructing a bpy&#8208;M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH)&#8208;M2 precursor, this method overcomes the randomness of traditional routes. The resulting FeCo DAC exhibits excellent ORR performance via a favorable dissociative pathway, breaking the OH*&#8208;OOH* scaling relation.








Abstract
Heteronuclear dual&#8208;atoms catalysts (DACs) represent an emerging frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to maximum atom utilization and synergistic catalysis, yet their precise synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;metal ion targeting coordination&#8221; (MITC) strategy to construct a series of heteronuclear DACs. This approach utilizes the bipyridyl (bpy) ligands to coordinate a primary metal (M1), forming an artificial monooxygenase (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH) structure, where electron&#8208;enriched oxygen atoms serve as anchoring sites for a secondary metal (M2). The oxygen bridged M1&#8208;O&#8208;M2 configurations in the resulting (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH)M2 precursors enable precise synthesis of heteronuclear DACs during the subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from geometric and electronic structure merits, heteronuclear DACs can efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a more desirable dissociative mechanism, thus circumventing the inherent OH*&#8208;OOH* linear scaling relations. Notably, the FeCo DAC exhibits exceptional ORR performance, with an onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.03&#160; and 0.93&#160;V, respectively. The excellent ORR activity of FeCo DAC is further validated in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), delivering a peak power density over 1.3&#8201;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a current density of 79.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free under H2&#8208;O2 conditions.

         <title>Mediating Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Kinetics on SiOx Anodes Using Proton Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel co&#8208;additive, bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (MBA), is introduced to enhance FEC utilization. MBA chemically reacts with FEC via nucleophilic substitution, forming carbamate intermediates that exhibit higher susceptibility to reductive degradation under electrochemical stimulation, thereby accelerating LiF nucleation.








Abstract
Silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes offer high energy density but suffer from significant volume variations, leading to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To enhance SEI stability, numerous electrolyte additives have been designed to decompose on the anode and form desirable SEI components (e.g., LiF).

     alt="Mediating Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Kinetics on SiOx Anodes Using Proton Acceptors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel co-additive, bis(2-methoxyethyl)amine (MBA), is introduced to enhance FEC utilization. MBA chemically reacts with FEC via nucleophilic substitution, forming carbamate intermediates that exhibit higher susceptibility to reductive degradation under electrochemical stimulation, thereby accelerating LiF nucleation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon (Si)-based anodes offer high energy density but suffer from significant volume variations, leading to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To enhance SEI stability, numerous electrolyte additives have been designed to decompose on the anode and form desirable SEI components (e.g., LiF). However, their electrochemical reduction kinetics on the anode surface competes with other electrolyte components, leading to suboptimal interfacial decomposition efficiency and a less stable SEI structure. Here, inspired by bioremediation strategies in petroleum pollution treatment, we introduce a proton acceptor that reacts with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), a commercially established additive, to generate an intermediate. Such an intermediate lowers the reduction kinetic barrier, accelerating the formation of LiF and enriching it in the inner layer of the SEI. Compared to the randomly distributed LiF structure, the resulting SEI exhibits better mechanical stability and lithium-ion conduction, effectively accommodating volume changes and mitigating stress concentration caused by local overlithiation. As a result, the electrochemical performance surpasses that of previously reported works. This intermediate-based strategy significantly improves the utilization efficiency of commercial additives, offering a practical direction for future electrolyte design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Platform for the Development of Highly Red&#8208;Shifted Azobenzene&#8208;Based Optical Tools</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our platform is built on a combination of chemical synthesis, NMR, UV&#8211;vis, and quantum chemical studies. The dfdc azobenzene scaffold provides efficient photoswitching with red light and the ability to fine&#8208;tune relaxation times. A TD&#8208;DFT&#8208;based workflow allows the in silico design of photoswitches with properties tailored to desired applications. The strong potential is demonstrated by the development of a red light&#8208;operated TRPC6 activator.








Abstract
Azobenzenes are versatile photoswitches that can be used to generate elaborate optical tools, including photopharmaceuticals. However, the targeted application&#8208;guided design of new photoswitches with specific properties remains challenging. We have developed synthetic protocols for derivatives of the dfdc (di&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoro&#8208;di&#8208;ortho&#8208;chloro) azobenzene scaffold with chemical alterations in the para&#8208;/ortho&#8208;positions and performed an in&#8208;depth study into the effects of their structures on their photophysical properties with an emphasis on the n&#160;&#8594;&#160;&#960;* absorption band using NMR, UV&#8211;vis, and X&#8208;ray analysis. The data was used to establish and validate a computational approach that allows to compute realistic UV&#8211;vis spectra by combining TD&#8208;DFT excited&#8208;state calculations from 6000 thermally accessible structures generated through MD simulations while considering the high structural flexibility of ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. We added 15 new visible light&#8208;operated photoswitches to the toolbox for the development of optical devices with relaxation rates across multiple orders of magnitude and identified several examples with stronger bathochromic shifts than the dfdc azobenzene lead structure. Our combined experimental and computational study forms the foundation for the advanced in silico design and synthesis of new highly red&#8208;shifted photoswitches. To showcase the potential of dfdc azobenzenes for the development of chemical tools, we synthesized dfdc&#8208;OptoBI&#8208;1 and demonstrated its biological activity as a red light&#8208;operated activator of TRPC6 channels in HEK293 cells.

         <title>Catalytic &#945;&#8208;Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange of Benzylic Alcohols by Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd SAC) enables &#945;&#8208;site&#8208;selective deuteration of benzylic alcohols via hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange (HDE), suppressing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration. Mechanistic studies reveal dual pathways: direct C&#9472;H activation and a modified borrowing&#8208;hydrogen route avoiding keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. The Pd SAC combines stability, reusability, and broad substrate compatibility under mild conditions, resolving longstanding challenges in site&#8208;selective deuteration. This work advances single&#8208;atom catalysis for precision deuterated drug synthesis.








Abstract
Catalytic hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange (HDE) has emerged as a valuable tool for achieving site&#8208;selective deuteration and the precision labeling of bioactive molecules. Incorporation of deuterium at metabolically labile positions, enabled by such methods, can potentially improve drug efficacy through the kinetic isotope effect. However, achieving precise, site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium at specific molecular positions remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly efficient &#945;&#8208;site&#8208;selective HDE of benzylic alcohols via a palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd SAC). By using the Pd SAC, exceptional activity and selectivity in HDE reactions were achieved, delivering up to 95% deuterium incorporation (D&#8208;inc.) at the &#945;&#8208;position while effectively suppressing undesired pathways (e.g., &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the Pd SAC promotes site&#8208;selective HDE through two distinct surface pathways: (i) a previously unreported direct C&#9472;H bond activation and (ii) a modified borrowing hydrogen process in which high&#8208;pressure hydrogen inhibits the keto enol tautomerization, thereby largely circumvents &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration. The catalyst exhibits robust stability, reusability, and broad substrate compatibility, underscoring its potential for practical applications. This work marks a significant advance in heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalytic methodologies for site&#8208;selective deuteration, offering a complementary solution to longstanding challenges in catalytic organic synthesis.

         <title>Internally BN&#8208;Doped Coronene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first derivatives of internally heteroatom&#8208;doped coronene with two covalent B&#9472;N units embedded on the central axis were synthesized. The B2N2 analogues retain the structure of coronene but exhibit stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, higher electronic coupling, and a narrowed solid&#8208;state bandgap. Driven by the B&#9472;N dipole&#8211;dipole interaction, all B2N2&#8208;coronene derivatives exhibit more ordered assembly with excimer emission in solution, which is absent in coronene. 








Abstract
We present the first synthesis of internally BN&#8208;doped coronenes (B2N2&#8208;C, H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C, and 2H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C) with two covalent B&#9472;N units embedded on the central axis of coronene. The B&#9472;N doping leads to unique electronic structures with distinct charge distribution, conjugation, aromaticity, and photophysical properties. The structures were successfully identified by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray scattering. B2N2&#8208;C without sidechains retains the structure of coronene but exhibits stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, higher electronic coupling, and a narrowed solid&#8208;state bandgap. Driven by the B&#9472;N dipole&#8211;dipole interaction, all B2N2&#8208;coronene derivatives exhibit more ordered assembly with excimer emission in solution, which is absent in coronene. Notably, two stable polymorphs emerge in single crystals of 2H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C with two hexyl chains: a kinetically stable rod phase and a thermodynamically stable plate phase, where variations in processing conditions direct the formation of different phases.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Nanoscale Engineering of Iridium&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in acidic oxygen evolution reactions, a laser&#8208;induced nano&#8208;oven method is developed for the precise synthesis of ultra&#8208;small crystalline iridium and iridium oxide nanoparticles under ambient conditions, employing a silicon dioxide matrix as a nanoscale reaction chamber. The synthesized &#8764;2&#160;nm rutile IrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a high mass activity of 350&#160;&#177;&#160;15 A gIr&#8315;&#185; at 300&#160;mV overpotential, achieving activity comparable to RuO&#8322; catalysts while demonstrating superior stability compared to commercial IrO2.








Abstract
While ruthenium oxide exhibits higher activity, it suffers from significantly lower stability in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In contrast, crystalline iridium oxide is among the few materials that remain stable under such harsh conditions. However, its low activity and iridium scarcity require strategies to enhance atomic utilization. Conventional high&#8208;temperature post&#8208;synthetic processing increases the share of rutile&#8208;phase iridium oxide while promoting particle growth, reducing catalytic activity due to a diminished surface area. Here, we present a laser&#8208;induced nano&#8208;oven method using a silicon dioxide matrix as a nanoscale reaction chamber, enabling solid&#8208;state nanoparticle synthesis under ambient conditions while preventing agglomeration and allowing precise size control. The synthesized ultra&#8208;small crystalline rutile iridium oxide of &#8764;2&#160;nm achieves a high mass activity of 350&#160;&#177;&#160;15 A gIr&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, exceeding that of crystalline RuO&#8322; and reaching the activity benchmark of RuO2&#8208;based catalysts. Analysis using a channel flow cell with on&#8208;line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) confirms that laser&#8208;engineered iridium oxide exhibits superior stability to commercial iridium oxide. Operando electron impact MS provided the synthesis mechanistic insights, demonstrating the potential of this strategy for synthesizing ultra&#8208;small crystalline metals and metal oxides for various applications.

The synthesized &#8764;2&#160;nm rutile IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles exhibit a high mass activity of 350&#160;&#177;&#160;15 A g&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;&#8315;&#185; at 300&#160;mV overpotential, achieving activity comparable to RuO&#8322; catalysts while demonstrating superior stability compared to commercial IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ruthenium oxide exhibits higher activity, it suffers from significantly lower stability in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In contrast, crystalline iridium oxide is among the few materials that remain stable under such harsh conditions. However, its low activity and iridium scarcity require strategies to enhance atomic utilization. Conventional high-temperature post-synthetic processing increases the share of rutile-phase iridium oxide while promoting particle growth, reducing catalytic activity due to a diminished surface area. Here, we present a laser-induced nano-oven method using a silicon dioxide matrix as a nanoscale reaction chamber, enabling solid-state nanoparticle synthesis under ambient conditions while preventing agglomeration and allowing precise size control. The synthesized ultra-small crystalline rutile iridium oxide of &#8764;2&#160;nm achieves a high mass activity of 350&#160;&#177;&#160;15 A g&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&#160;mV overpotential, exceeding that of crystalline RuO&#8322; and reaching the activity benchmark of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based catalysts. Analysis using a channel flow cell with on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) confirms that laser-engineered iridium oxide exhibits superior stability to commercial iridium oxide. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; electron impact MS provided the synthesis mechanistic insights, demonstrating the potential of this strategy for synthesizing ultra-small crystalline metals and metal oxides for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Preserving, Dimensionality&#8208;Increasing Strategy for the Stepwise Synthesis of Microporous &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Broad (100) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;preserving, dimensionality&#8208;increasing strategy was developed to synthesize 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 from 0D [Mo2O5(H2O)6]2+ via a 1D Mo2O6{(CH3)2NCHO} intermediate. Unlike conventional &#945;&#8208;MoO3, which predominantly exposes the (010) plane, simple temperature&#8208;controlled calcination of the 1D structure yielded metastable &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with the (100) plane as the broad face, large surface areas, and micropores, enabling high&#8208;performance acid catalysis.








Abstract
Metal oxides with diverse structures and dimensionalities are typically synthesized via solid&#8208;state or hydrothermal reactions. However, it is quite difficult to retain the structures of the starting materials when 0D metal salts or molecular clusters are used as precursors because higher&#8208;dimensional structures form by structural reorganization through isomerization and decomposition/condensation reactions. In this study, we demonstrated a structure&#8208;preserving, dimensionality&#8208;increasing strategy for the synthesis of 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 from 0D [Mo2O5(H2O)6]2+ species via a 1D [Mo2O6{(CH3)2NCHO}]n intermediate while maintaining the structures of the precursors. By simple temperature&#8208;controlled calcination, metastable crystals of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 in which the (100) plane was the broad face were successfully synthesized, differing from conventional &#945;&#8208;MoO3 in which the (010) plane is the broad face. In addition, the prepared metastable crystals possessed large surface areas, unusual micropores, and surface&#8208;exposed coordinatively unsaturated Mo sites, allowing them to serve as high&#8208;performance acid catalysts. This synthesis strategy is expected to facilitate the synthesis of metastable structures and the design of defects and surface structures at the atomic level.

         <title>Desolvation&#8208;Induced Network Reformation and Cracking in the Single Crystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Tetraazaanthraquinone and Anthraquinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two solvated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) based on tetraazaanthraquinone and anthraquinone were found to undergo quasi single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations through hydrogen&#8208;bond cleavage and re&#8208;formation. These transformations induced crystal crack propagations, and molecular&#8208;level correlations between the structural transformations and crack propagations were proposed for both HOFs.








Abstract
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of how structural transformations induce morphological changes in organic crystals is essential for developing flexible crystalline materials. Herein, we report that two solvated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) undergo structural transformations, giving rise to crystal crack propagation in the directions corresponding to their molecular displacements. The HOFs are composed of the tetracarboxylic acids, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(5,10&#8208;dioxo&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,7,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid (TAAQ) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(9,10&#8208;dioxo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid (AQ), incorporating tetraazaanthraquinone and anthraquinone cores, respectively. Although TAAQ and AQ have closely similar molecular geometries, their HOFs have entirely different hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. In both HOFs, we found that specific directional hydrogen bonds cleaved, and new hydrogen bonds re&#8208;formed, resulting in quasi single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The direction of molecular displacement and crystal cell shrinkage were aligned parallel to the crack propagation. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying micro&#8211;macro property correlations induced by hydrogen&#8208;bond cleavage and re&#8208;formation.

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru Single Atoms Enabling Efficient Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer and transport capacities of catalyst were improved by modulating the electronic structure, thereby significantly reducing the desorption and adsorption temperature of MgH2, enhancing the kinetics, and improving the cyclic stability. This provides a new direction for the design of efficient catalysts for hydrogen storage materials.








Abstract
Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material due to its high capacity and low cost, but its high dehydrogenation temperature and poor kinetic limit its applications. Although catalytic modification of MgH2 has been extensively studied, existing efforts focus on optimizing hydrogen transfer, with limited exploration of electron transfer and transport. This study investigated the enhancement of electron transfer and transport rates during MgH2 de/hydrogenation by introducing a single&#8208;atom catalyst composed of Ru single atoms on a Nb2O5 substrate. The Ru0.028@Nb2O5 single&#8208;atom catalyst reduced the peak dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 from 429&#176;C to 214&#160;&#176;C, and the activation energies for de/hydrogenation were reduced by 53.7% and 83.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the 15&#160;wt.%&#8208;Ru0.028@Nb2O5&#8208;MgH2 composite maintained 97.4% capacity after 100 cycles. Based on excellent performance and theoretical calculations, it was demonstrated that the electronic structure modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru single atoms enhanced the electron transfer and transport capacities, and the synergistic effects of single&#8208;atom Ru (dominant role), multivalent Nb, and oxygen vacancies resulted in remarkable catalytic activity. This study offers a new strategy for improving electron transfer and transport by modulating the electronic structure of catalysts, thereby increasing catalytic activity during the solid&#8208;state pyrolysis reaction of hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>Interplay Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Repulsions, Sigma Hole Interactions, and Delocalized Redox Processes in Topochemical Fluoride&#8208;Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and diffusion within Sn2TiO4 is mediated by the complex interplay between the formation of Sn&#9472;F dative interactions and redox processes delocalized across Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn hybrid states counterbalanced by repulsions between fluoride&#8208;ions and stereochemically expressed Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs. The coupled ion&#8212;electron transfer and transport processes are mediated along large tunnels that themselves result from stereochemical expression and repulsions between Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs.








Abstract
Topochemical insertion/extraction of cations has emerged as a generalizable strategy for modulating the crystal and electronic structure of periodic solids. In contrast, strategies for topochemical anion insertion are poorly explored and fundamental principles for designing insertion hosts to accommodate anions remain scarce. Here, we observe reversible room&#8208;temperature fluoride&#8208;ion insertion within tunnels of Sn2TiO4 defined by the stereochemical expression of Sn 5s2 lone pairs. X&#8208;ray scattering studies of fluoride&#8208;ion&#8208;insertion&#8208;induced crystal structure modulation and X&#8208;ray absorption/emission spectroscopy probes of electronic structure along with magnetic susceptibility measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations are used to decipher design principles underpinning reversible fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and bulk diffusion. Fluoride&#8208;ion insertion is enabled by a combination of a large, polarizable tunnel, delocalized redox at Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn centers, inherent repulsion between the fluoride&#8208;ion and Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs, and the formation of dative interactions between Sn&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;holes and fluoride&#8208;ions, yielding a reversible capacity of 0.5 fluoride&#8208;ions per Sn2TiO4 formula unit. Our results demonstrate that the complex interplay between dative interactions and stereochemically active lone pair repulsions is critical to defining the thermodynamics and kinetics controlling fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and diffusion.

&lt;p&gt;Fluoride-ion insertion and diffusion within Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is mediated by the complex interplay between the formation of Sn&#9472;F dative interactions and redox processes delocalized across Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn hybrid states counterbalanced by repulsions between fluoride-ions and stereochemically expressed Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron lone pairs. The coupled ion&#8212;electron transfer and transport processes are mediated along large tunnels that themselves result from stereochemical expression and repulsions between Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron lone pairs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topochemical insertion/extraction of cations has emerged as a generalizable strategy for modulating the crystal and electronic structure of periodic solids. In contrast, strategies for topochemical anion insertion are poorly explored and fundamental principles for designing insertion hosts to accommodate anions remain scarce. Here, we observe reversible room-temperature fluoride-ion insertion within tunnels of Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; defined by the stereochemical expression of Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone pairs. X-ray scattering studies of fluoride-ion-insertion-induced crystal structure modulation and X-ray absorption/emission spectroscopy probes of electronic structure along with magnetic susceptibility measurements and first-principles calculations are used to decipher design principles underpinning reversible fluoride-ion insertion and bulk diffusion. Fluoride-ion insertion is enabled by a combination of a large, polarizable tunnel, delocalized redox at Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn centers, inherent repulsion between the fluoride-ion and Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron lone pairs, and the formation of dative interactions between Sn-centered &#963;-holes and fluoride-ions, yielding a reversible capacity of 0.5 fluoride-ions per Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formula unit. Our results demonstrate that the complex interplay between dative interactions and stereochemically active lone pair repulsions is critical to defining the thermodynamics and kinetics controlling fluoride-ion insertion and diffusion. As such, the design of fluoride-ion insertion hosts for anion batteries requires site-selective modification to modulate lattice&#8212;ion interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Ammonia Formation Catalyzed by Molybdenum and Samarium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of newly prepared samarium complexes were found to work as effective PCET catalysts to facilitate the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation from dinitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. This is the first successful example of samarium complexes working as effective catalysts over 300 times to facilitate the transfer of protons and electrons in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation.








Abstract
A series of novel samarium complexes bearing cyclopentadienyl&#8211;amide chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis. The complexes function as effective proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts, facilitating molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation from dinitrogen under ambient conditions. In this reaction system, the Sm complexes could be recycled over 300 times, and they increased the ammonia formation rate by sevenfold compared to that obtained for reactions occurring in the absence of such complexes. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations indicate that the Sm complexes undergo protonation and reduction to form Sm(II) complexes, which then accelerate proton and electron transfer to the Mo complexes via PCET processes from the terminal proton source and reductant. This paper presents the first successful example of Sm complexes that can function as efficient catalysts for 300 cycles, promoting proton and electron transfer in Mo&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation.

         <title>Rational Design of Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview offers a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy and outlines two design strategies for Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents: thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block Type&#8208;II excitation energy transfer, and kinetic optimization of photoinduced electron/hydrogen transfer processes to enhance Type&#8208;I pathway.








Abstract
Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents can not only produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, but also directly damage biomolecules through electron/hydrogen transfer process, exhibiting reduced dependence on oxygen concentration in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The rational design of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents has attracted increasing attention. This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I PDT and its advantages in treating hypoxic tumors. It systematically outlines two complementary design strategies: i) thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block the Type&#8208;II energy transfer pathway, and ii) kinetic enhancement of electron/hydrogen transfer to favor the Type&#8208;I mechanism. Finally, key challenges in Type&#8208;I PDT are discussed, and future perspectives are highlighted to facilitate the clinical translation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. We hope this review will stimulate further progress in the development of innovative PDT.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted PCET and Formation of WIII&#9472;OH in Bis(Dithiolene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single crystal structure of complex [2Et3NH&#8208;1] reveals hydrogen bonding at both W&#8208;oxo and dithiolene&#8208;S sites within the bis(dithiolene) WIV&#8208;oxo complex. This finding provides critical evidence for dithiolene's involvement in proton reactions in high&#8208;valent W&#8208;oxo complexes. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions promote the electrochemical formation of WIII&#9472;OH, characterized here for the first time using EPR spectroscopy.








Abstract
The redox non&#8208;innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high&#8208;valent metal ions and facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low&#8208;valent metal centers, as high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high&#8208;valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)&#8208;oxo complexes featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W&#8208;oxo, forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene&#8208;sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV&#8594;III reduction at &#8722;1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII&#9472;OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV&#9552;O state would populate the dithiolene &#960;* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal&#160;= &#8722;3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene&#8208;S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV&#9472;H catalytic species.

         <title>&#8220;Rigid Exterior, Soft Interior&#8221; Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage Polyether Electrolytes for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel high&#8208;voltage polyether electrolyte with &#8220;rigid exterior, soft interior&#8221; design is developed, which involves a 3D F&#8208;contained network as rigid exterior framework, and a unique solvation structure with intensified Li+&#8208;anion coordination as soft interior within the framework. Such electrolyte induces salt&#8208;philic, solvent&#8208;phobic interfacial films for stabilizing electrolyte/electrode interphases toward superior quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Polyether electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity and excellent interfacial contact have garnered significant attention. Yet further applications of such electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries are severely hindered by the instability of the electrolyte and electrolyte/electrodes interphases. Here, we report a novel high&#8208;voltage polyether electrolyte with a &#8220;rigid exterior, soft interior&#8221; design, which involves a 3D F&#8208;contained network as a rigid exterior framework, and a unique solvation structure with intensified Li+&#8208;anion coordination as a soft interior within the framework. The achieved electrolyte demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 1.13 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, a Li+ transference number of 0.85, and an extended electrochemical stability window of over 5&#160;V. Besides, such a designed polyether electrolyte further induces salt&#8208;philic, solvent&#8208;phobic interfacial films for stabilizing electrolyte/electrode interphases. An exceptional cyclability in a Li||Li cell for over 4000&#160;h, and a preferable capacity and cyclability in even 4.6&#160;V Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are demonstrated. Meanwhile, the resulting 4.3&#160;V Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 QSSB shows a Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;100% and an extremely high capacity retention of 95.4% after 600 cycles at 3C. A capacity retention of over 96.3% after 400 cycles at 1C are further realized in 4.5&#160;V Li||NCM811 QSSB.

         <title>Identifying the Role of Pt Active Species in CO&#8208;Sensitive Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic H2 evolution, Pt4+ species is identified as the key active species for H2 production when the amount ratio of CO to Pt is low (nCO/nPt&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.3), but the adsorbed CO molecules impede the interaction between H2O and Pt4+ species and prevent the generation of *H species and H2 at a high ratio of nCO/nPt (&gt; 1000). This study sheds light on the generation and transformation of active H species in CO&#8208;participated photocatalytic systems, which is missing in previous works, and is more significant for rationally designing Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts in large&#8208;scale H2 production.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) has been widely employed in photocatalytic H2 production. However, the influence of CO on proton reduction to H2 over Pt active species remains unknown. Herein, using Pt/Nb2O5 as a model catalyst, the role of Pt active species in CO&#8208;sensitive photocatalytic H2 evolution is evaluated. Our results reveal that Pt4+ species exhibits superior activity in H2 production when the CO&#8208;to&#8208;Pt molar ratio is low (nCO/nPt&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.3), but their photocatalytic performance is suppressed at a high nCO/nPt ratio (&gt;1000). By contrast, increasing the loading amount of Pt suppresses Pt4+ species formation and the low valence state Pt species show inferior activity for H2 production, which is almost unaffected by the nCO/nPt ratio. The CO&#8208;TPD results, in situ FTIR spectra, and DFT calculations indicate that the role of adsorbed CO molecules is to impede the interaction between H2O and Pt4+ species and prevent the generation of *H species for H2 production. Significantly improving the H2 production rate by purging with argon suggests the importance of inhibiting the adsorption of CO on Pt4+ species. This study sheds light on the generation and transformation of active H species in CO&#8208;participated photocatalytic systems, which is missing in previous works, and is more significant for rationally designing Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts in large&#8208;scale H2 production.

Enzymes are powerful catalysts. Unfortunately, computational enzyme design remains challenging. In their Research Article, H. Adrian Bunzel and co&#8208;workers develop AI.zymes (e202507031), a modular platform integrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational tools through evolutionary design. AI.zymes boost enzymes by optimizing biocatalytic features such as transition&#8208;state binding, protein stability, and electrostatic catalysis. Its modular architecture will facilitate the integration of emerging design algorithms and enable addressing diverse design challenges.

         <title>Azine&#8208;Pyridine Frame Generated Covalent Organic Frameworks and Self&#8208;polymerized Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into industrializable films with inherently functionalities has remained a major challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, through developing skeletal azine&#8208;pyridine conformation, we present an effectual synthetic frame to conduct a family of powdery COFs into self&#8208;polymerized COFs films under green and ambient conditions. The active proton tautomerism in our azine&#8208;pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self&#8208;polymerization of large&#8208;area COFs films from ca. 10 nm to &gt; 30 &#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine&#8208;pyridine based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624 mg g&#8722;1, reducing capacity on ions of Au3+&#8594;Au0 and Cr6+&#8594;Cr3+, 99.9% UV&#8208;blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights, and 10&#8208;folds increase of Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine&#8208;pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano&#8208;electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Driven Borrowing Hydrogen Processes for Ru&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation: A Pathway to Enhanced Sustainability and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical borrowing hydrogen (BH) strategy for the rapid and efficient N&#8208;alkylation of amines and heterocycles. By removing harsh conditions and toxic reagents while employing a simple Ru catalyst, this approach redefines BH as a cleaner, more versatile, and sustainable platform for synthetic chemistry.








Abstract
This study presents the first mechanochemical borrowing hydrogenation (BH) strategy, offering a direct and efficient route to N&#8208;alkylated amines and heterocycles. This solvent&#8208;free approach overcomes many challenges associated with conventional solution&#8208;based syntheses, such as toxic reagents, inert atmospheres, high temperatures, lengthy reaction times, excessive catalyst loadings, and the use of solvents. By applying this method under mechanochemical conditions and employing a readily available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst, we achieved high conversions of a diverse set of primary amines and alcohols into N&#8208;alkylated amines. Furthermore, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and Hammett analyses provided key insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Ultimately, this protocol expands synthetic possibilities by facilitating the preparation of heterocycles.

         <title>Dictating Zn2+ Transport Kinetics via Versatile Ionic Covalent Organic Framework for Robust Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;crystallinity ionic covalent organic framework membrane has been directly grown on Zn foil in a scalable manner. With the help of the guanidinium moiety to immobilize water molecules and the charged framework to manage coulombic interactions, durable Zn anodes could be realized by suppressing side reactions and stabilizing ion transport.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a promising platform in regulating ion transport and stabilizing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces owing to their tailorable porosity and versatile moiety. Compared to widely employed neutral COFs, ionic COFs (iCOFs) harness strong electrostatic interactions to selectively interact with target ions, thereby helping accelerate ion&#8208;pair dissociation. Furthermore, the charged backbones of iCOFs induce interlayer electrostatic repulsion, driving spontaneous exfoliation and hence promoting ion transport kinetics. Capitalizing upon these advantages, we in situ engineer a low&#8208;crystallinity iCOF interfacial membrane over Zn anode. The guanidinium moieties within the framework immobilize water molecules through H&#8208;bond interactions, effectively suppressing parasitic side reactions. Concurrently, coulombic interactions between the positively charged backbone and SO42&#8722; facilitate Zn2+ dissociation, enabling stable ion transport and uniform Zn deposition. Benefiting from the improved electrochemical stability of modified Zn anode, the as&#8208;assembled Zn metal pouch cell delivers a reversible capacity of &#8764;0.35 Ah g&#8722;1 with a 98.72% capacity retention over prolonged cycling. This work establishes a paradigm for leveraging iCOFs to regulate Zn2+ transport kinetics toward next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Nanoconfined Polymerization Facilitates Efficient Li+ Transportation in Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale confined polymerization (NCP) strategy was employed to prepare a composite GPE comprising of porous COF and linear polymers (PDA@CityU&#8208;43). The PDA@CityU&#8208;43 achieves a high ionic conductivity (6.02&#215;10&#8722;3 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.82), which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Highly improved cycling performance of 6000&#160;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 96.15% capacity retention after 550 cycles for LFP full&#8208;cell are achieved.








Abstract
Conventional gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) struggle with lithium dendrite growth and long&#8208;term cycling stability due to low ionic conductivity. A nanoconfined polymerization (NCP) strategy was employed to develop a composite GPE (PDA@CityU&#8208;43) comprising porous COF and linear polymers. The crosslinked polymer chains are confined within the nanopores of CityU&#8208;43 along c&#8208;direction, improving polymer distribution and filler&#8208;polymer compatibility. The PDA@CityU&#8208;43 achieves a high ionic conductivity (6.02 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.82), which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Thus, the Li||Li cell can stably operate over 6000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li||PDA@CityU&#8208;43||LFP demonstrates significantly improved cycling stability at 5C, a reversible capacity of 108 mAh/g after 300 cycles. The Li||PDA@CityU&#8208;43||NCM811 cells with high mass loading (&#8764;5.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) exhibits 72.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles. This NCP strategy offers a new approach to designing advanced GPEs for Li metal batteries.

         <dc:description>
A unified strain&#8208;enabled radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) annulation strategy to access spiro&#8208;, fused&#8208;, and enantioenriched&#8208;aza/oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single experimental protocol from readily accessible amino/hydroxy acids under photoredox catalysis has been developed. A combined experiment&#8208;based mechanistic study and detailed DFT calculations rationalized the observed reactivity and regioselectivity.








Abstract
Conformationally rigid bridged bicyclic scaffolds have emerged as bioisosteric replacements for planar aromatic rings. However, bioisosteric mimetics of heteroaromatic rings have been investigated less due to the challenges of incorporating heteroatoms into bicycloalkanes. Herein, we report a unified strategy to access both aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single experimental protocol from a readily accessible amino/hydroxy acid derivative under photoredox catalysis. The reaction exhibits a broad scope across a range of redox&#8208;active esters and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and successfully provides previously inaccessible spiro&#8208; and fused&#8208;hetero&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Noteworthy, chiral amino/hydroxy acid derived redox&#8208;active esters could be used to access enantioenriched hetero&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Furthermore, the strategy has been extended to access aza&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, another important motif in medicinal chemistry. The functional groups introduced during the reaction serve as a synthetic handle for downstream manipulations, thus offering opportunities to build up molecular complexity rapidly. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism and rationalize the observed regioselectivity.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Adapted Active Site Self&#8208;Evolving Reconfiguration Boosting Catalytic Effect on Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration strategy for spontaneous construction of an adaptive multimolecular activation catalyst such as for acetylene semihydrogenation was presented. This self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration creates cooperative Cu1 and Cu nanocluster (Cun) ensemble sites with a dynamic active configuration, enabling adaptive multisubstrate H2 and acetylene activation.








Abstract
The facile synthesis of highly substrate&#8208;adapted catalysts with dynamic active site adaptability remains a persistent challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, breaking through conventional catalyst preparation route of design&#8211;synthesis&#8211;evaluation iteration, we demonstrate an active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration strategy for spontaneous construction of an adaptive multimolecular activation catalyst, such as for acetylene semihydrogenation. Specifically, a metastable Cu single atom (Cu1) precursor as structural seed reconstructs to an exceptional acetylene semihydrogenation catalyst under moderate operational conditions, which undergoes a copper active site reconfiguration employing reactants themselves as inducing medium. This self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration creates cooperative Cu1 and Cu nanocluster (Cun) ensemble sites with a dynamic active configuration, which is unavailable by conventional thermal reduction methodology, for adaptive multisubstrate H2 and acetylene activation. Hence, the resulting catalyst achieves full acetylene conversion with 96% ethylene selectivity and robust durability (&gt;30&#160;h) at a record&#8208;low temperature of 120 &#176;C, superior to reported copper&#8208;based analogues. Such spontaneous active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration offers a new possibility for intelligent catalyst engineering.

         <title>Modular Assembly of B(III)&#8208;Coordinated Fluorophores with Quantitatively Predictable Photoinduced Electron Transfer for Chemosensing and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the tetrahedral geometry of B(III) centers, we introduce the design of B&#8208;PeT dyes to precisely tailor their electronic energy levels and photophysical properties. A modular multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis was developed to rapidly assemble 75 visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR B(III)&#8208;dyes, facilitating the elucidation and prediction of structure&#8208;PeT activity. The B&#8208;PeT dyes enabled successful ER&#8208;targeted photoactivated imaging and lysosomal pH monitoring.








Abstract
Photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), a foundational mechanism for constructing stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent probes, faces persistent challenges, including the lack of generalizable quantitative models, limited systematic case studies, signal interference, and synthetic complexity. Herein, we propose a boron&#8208;centric PeT molecular engineering strategy that harnesses the unique tetrahedral coordination geometry of B(III) centers. This approach leverages the programmable nature of boron coordination chemistry to precisely tailor dye electronic energy levels and photophysical properties. Using dipyrromethane as a core scaffold and modulating boronic acid coordination with diverse nucleophiles (such as alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids), we developed a modular, multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis platform for efficient assembly of B&#8208;PeT dyes. Extending this strategy to pyrrolyldipyrrin and dipyrrolyldipyrrin scaffolds achieved the synthesis of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) B&#8208;PeT dyes. A library of 75 B(III)&#8208;derivatives was synthesized and characterized to enable systematic elucidation and predictive modeling of structure&#8208;PeT activity relationships, providing mechanistic insights to guide mitigation of PeT signal interference. The engineered B&#8208;PeT probes exhibit superior performance in photoactivated imaging and lysosomal pH sensing, highlighting their translational potential. Our work establishes boron coordination chemistry as a modular toolkit for rational PeT probe design, offering scalable molecular platforms for next&#8208;generation sensors with enhanced functionality and synthetic efficiency.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Inducible Receptor Oligomerization Enables Fine&#8208;Tuning of T Cell Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers targeting membrane receptors are extended with rolling circle amplification (RCA)&#8208;duplicated fragments of a split ATP&#8208;binding aptamer to facilitate ATP&#8208;responsive receptor oligomerization, allowing for the reconfiguration of T cell immunity in the tumor microenvironment, holding significant potential for advancing cancer therapeutic interventions.








Abstract
Receptor oligomerization plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular behaviors and functionalities. Stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial circuits are often programmed to rewire cell signaling by fine&#8208;tuning receptor interactions through targeted stimulation. Notably, the integration of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive systems capable of locally altering cancer cell phenotypes or transforming anti&#8208;tumor responses of immune cells offers a novel and promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of cancer treatments. In this paper, we introduce an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;inducible receptor oligomerization (ATIRO) approach to facilitate the clustering of CD3 and CD8 of T cells and the engagement of CD3 and tumor markers of T cells and targeted cancer cells to prompt anti&#8208;tumor immunity. ATIRO enables the specific in situ activation of T cells by the high&#8208;level ATP presented in TME, thereby effectively suppressing tumor growth in vivo. ATIRO presents a versatile and readily adaptable strategy for the in&#8208;situ reconfiguration of T cell immunity, holding significant potential for advancing cancer therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanisms Behind Structural Repair of Spent Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural repair is key to direct recycling, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. By combining XRD, XAS, and 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR, this study identifies a repair process involving re&#8208;lithiation, oxygen capture, transition&#8208;metal oxidation, and migration for LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 layered cathode &#8212;governed by temperature and lithium compensation. An atomic&#8208;level repair mechanism is thus proposed, offering valuable insights into cathode performance recovery.








Abstract
Structural repair is a vital step in the direct recycling of spent LiNixCoyMnzO2 lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently clear. Herein, the thermal solid&#8208;state structural repair of spent LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) layered cathode material is systematically investigated. Through multiscale techniques combining XRD, XAS, and 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR, we identify the structural degradation in spent NCM622 and monitor both long&#8208; and short&#8208;range structural evolution during repair. Our findings reveal that degradation predominantly occurs through Ni migration into Li octahedral sites, while Co and Mn demonstrate relatively lower occupancies in the Li layer. Such occupancies are primarily responsible for structural disorder and cubic&#8208;symmetry domain formation within the spent material. The repair process is demonstrated to involve re&#8208;lithiation, oxygen capture, increased transition metal (TM) oxidation states, and the migration of TM ions from the Li layer back to the TM layer, followed by cation diffusion. Both temperature and lithium compensation ratio are identified as critical factors promoting these processes. Capacity recovery studies show a strong correlation between reduced TM occupancy in the Li layer and improved electrochemical performances. These insights allow us to move beyond conventional phase&#8208;transition perspectives, offering an atomic&#8208;level understanding of structural degradation and repair mechanisms in spent layered cathode materials.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Driven Multilevel Fluorescent Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the IQP&#8834;CB[8] photodriven [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, fluorescent information encryption materials featuring photo&#8208;responsiveness, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and time&#8208;dependent behavior were constructed, enabling multilevel information storage and encryption through synergistic multiparameter control.








Abstract
The growing demand for information security in the digital era has accelerated the development of novel encryption materials, among which optically responsive systems have emerged as particularly promising candidates due to their exceptional tunability and noninvasive characteristics. However, current optical encryption materials remain largely confined to static or binary states, presenting a fundamental challenge in achieving precisely controlled hierarchically responses for developing high&#8208;capacity, multilevel encrypted materials. Herein, we successfully construct a novel class of dynamically multilevel responsive luminescent materials driven by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and apply them to a multilevel information encryption system. The highly efficient host&#8211;guest complexation between 4&#8208;phenylpyridine&#8208;functionalized isoquinoline derivatives (IQP) and macrocyclic molecule CB[8] enables the construction of linear supramolecular polymers (IQP&#8834;CB[8]). Affected by the dynamic protonation of isoquinoline and the host&#8211;guest interaction, the monomer and polymer exhibit the characteristics of multicolor luminescence. Furthermore, IQP can undergo a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction in the confined space of CB[8], it can reversibly transform from a conjugated supramolecular polymer to a nonconjugated polyrotaxane and shows pronounced optical response on the time gradient. Consequently, this light, heat, acid/base&#8208;sensitive supramolecular system exhibits reversible responsiveness and time&#8208;dependent characteristics, thereby establishing a multichannel fluorescent cascade encryption platform capable of multilevel information encryption.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Augmented Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MD) Reveal Insights Into the Disconnect Between Affinity and Activation of ZTP Riboswitch Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines computational and experimental approaches to study how natural and synthetic small molecules interact with the ZTP riboswitch, a bacterial RNA element that regulates gene expression. Using chemical synthesis, biochemical approaches, and artificial intelligence augmented MD simulations, we analyze both ligand binding and riboswitch activation. Findings show that ligand on&#8208;rates, but not affinity, drive activation and offer insights into RNA structural dynamics.








Abstract
The challenge of targeting RNA with small molecules necessitates a better understanding of RNA&#8211;ligand interaction mechanisms. However, the dynamic nature of nucleic acids, their ligand&#8208;induced stabilization, and how conformational changes influence gene expression pose significant difficulties for experimental investigation. This work employs a combination of computational and experimental methods to address these challenges. By integrating structure&#8208;informed design, crystallography, and machine learning&#8208;augmented all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we synthesized, biophysically and biochemically characterized, and studied the dissociation of a library of small molecule activators of the 5&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8211;4&#8211;carboxamide ribonucleotide triphosphate (ZTP) riboswitch, a ligand&#8208;binding RNA motif that regulates bacterial gene expression. We uncovered key interaction mechanisms, revealing valuable insights into the role of ligand binding kinetics on riboswitch activation. Further, we established that ligand on&#8208;rates determine activation potency as opposed to binding affinity and elucidated RNA structural differences, which provide mechanistic insights into the interplay of RNA structure on riboswitch&#160;activation.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Mn&#8208;based Catalyst for Durable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction in Acid at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diatomic Mn catalyst with high&#8208;spin MnII centers unlock 2e&#8722; ORR pathway and exhibit outstanding stability (240&#160;h at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for H2O2 electrosynthesis under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) often shows limited stability at high current densities in acidic media. Mn&#8208;based catalysts have been demonstrated highly stable for four&#8208;electron ORR thanks to their intrinsically low rate constant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, their activity toward acidic 2e&#8722; ORR remains low because of too strong adsorption to *OOH. Here, we report a diatomic Mn catalyst with high&#8208;spin MnII centers to enable high onset potential (0.69&#160;V), high selectivity (&gt;90%), and outstanding stability (240&#160;h under 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) toward H2O2 electrosynthesis in acid. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopies reveal that the diatomic Mn sites have downshifted d&#8208;band center and thus weakened adsorption strength for *OOH. Moreover, the inertia of the MnII sites toward the troublesome Fenton&#8208;like reactions leads to the long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. We further demonstrate the functionalization of waste polyethylene (PE) using the high&#8208;concentration H2O2 as produced, which provides a sustainable route toward on&#8208;site upcycling of plastic waste.

We further demonstrate the functionalization of waste polyethylene (PE) using the high-concentration H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as produced, which provides a sustainable route toward on-site upcycling of plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electro&#8208;Oxidation of Ethylene to 2&#8208;Chloroethanol on SnO2 Through Dual&#8208;Adsorbate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of chlorine&#8208;participated ethylene oxidation on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode is elucidated. In this process, 92% of 2&#8208;chloroethanol is produced through the dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway, where ethylene directly couples with chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH). 








Abstract
Electrified 2&#8208;chloroethanol synthesis serves as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene oxidation with corrosive hypochlorous acid (HClO) and offers the opportunity for sustainable pharmaceutical production. However, the instability of locally generated HClO and the competing water oxidation largely limit the efficiency of this electrochemical process. Here we report a new reaction pathway involved in the ethylene oxidation toward 2&#8208;chloroethanol, featuring co&#8208;adsorbed chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH) species on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode. This dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway favors the efficient ethylene oxidation, giving rise to a large current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for at least 50 h and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 82% for the 2&#8208;chloroethanol product. This work opens an avenue for electrifying the synthesis of important organic molecules via simultaneously modulating the adsorption of multiple active intermediates.

         <title>A Cu&#8208;Pb Hybrid Layer Architecture as a New Structural Prototype for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D Double Perovskite Broadband Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enrich the structural chemistry and improve the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of typical two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lead perovskites, we proposed a novel multicomponent structural engineering strategy and designed new class of 2D double perovskites of [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 [AMP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(Aminomethyl)piperidinium, X&#9552;Br and I], which is completely different from the typical A2BIBIIIX8&#8208;type double perovskites. Compared to the negligible luminescence (PLQY&#160;&lt;&#160;2%) of 2D [AMP]2PbX4 analogs, the [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 compounds demonstrate strong broadband yellow&#8208;orange emissions (PLQY&#160;&gt;&#160;48%) due to enhanced exciton binding energy, electron/hole effective mass, exciton confinement efficiency and exciton self&#8208;trapping depth. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising next&#8208;generation luminescent materials due to their high chemical versatility and excellent broadband light emission properties. However, their practical applications are often limited by low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by insufficient exciton confinement and extended charge&#8208;carrier diffusion lengths within the 2D anionic layers. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel multicomponent structural engineering strategy that led to the design of [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 double perovskites [AMP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(Aminomethyl)piperidinium, X&#9552;Br&#8722; and I&#8722;]. These materials feature [Cu2PbX8]4&#8722; monolayers consisting of alternating corner&#8208;sharing [Cu2X6]4&#8722; dimers and [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedra. Compared to the negligible luminescence observed in 2D [AMP]PbX4 analogs, the [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 compounds demonstrate strong broadband yellow&#8208;orange emission originating from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs), achieving high PLQYs exceeding 48%. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporation of [Cu2X6]4&#8722; dimers simultaneously enhances exciton binding energy, electron/hole effective mass, exciton confinement efficiency and STE self&#8208;trapping depth, which are all critical factors contributing to the improved PLQY. This work successfully demonstrates a new class of 2D double perovskites with exceptional luminescent performance, advancing perovskite chemistry through a dual&#8208;engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes both material structure and photophysical properties.

         <title>Chiral Selenium&#8208;Integrated Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Showing Improved Reverse Intersystem Crossing Rate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selenium&#8208;based tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe emitter containing a twisted ortho&#8208;disposed tert&#8208;butylcarbazole shows high &#934;PL, suppressed ACQ, fast kRISC and is chiral. The OLEDs show high EQEmax and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off compared to devices with carbonyl&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters.








Abstract
Nitrogen/carbonyl (N/C&#9552;O) based multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are attractive due to their bright, narrowband emission and the ease with which they can be synthesized. However, their photophysics typically suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) because of their relatively large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Thus, the organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with these emitters typically show severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, two MR&#8208;TADF emitters DiKTaSe and tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe have been designed and synthesized. The introduction of selenium in the form of an annelated benzoselenophene enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and increases the RISC rate. The twisted ortho&#8208;substituted tert&#8208;butylcarbazole moiety in tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe helps to suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of the emission in films. In addition, the large size of the selenium atom and long C&#9472;Se bonds induce helical chirality in both DiKTaSe and tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe. Finally, the OLEDs with DiKTaSe showed maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 22.7% while OLEDs with tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe showed a higher EQEmax of 27.8% and less&#8208;pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE at 100 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE100)/ EQE at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE1000) of 23.5/12.5%. These efficiency values are amongst the highest of devices employing DiKTa&#8208;based emitters. Our work provides key insight into how to judiciously employ heavy atoms to increase the performance of the emitter and the device.

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor Bicyclobutanes Enabled by Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthons, acceptor&#8208;acceptor bicyclobutanes, and a novel cycloaddition strategy involving Lewis base catalysis have been introduced into the cycloaddition chemistry of BCBs, thereby expanding the toolkit for synthesizing pharmaceutically valuable bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes.








Abstract
Owing to the advent of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, the utilization of donor&#8208;acceptor bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a three&#8208;atom component in (3&#160;+&#160;X) cycloaddition reactions has emerged as a highly efficient platform for constructing saturated bicyclic scaffolds that can serve as arene bioisosteres. However, the application of Lewis base catalysis in such reactions remains underexplored, and the strategy for the cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs remains unknown. Herein, we report the first formal (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs, which serve as a four&#8208;atom component, for the selective synthesis of pharmaceutically valuable oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (oxa&#8208;BCHeps) enabled by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. BCBs and carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, with various functional groups, are well&#8208;tolerated under mild conditions, yielding oxa&#8208;BCHeps with up to 87% yield, competing with at least five side reactions. The versatility of this synthetic method is further demonstrated through derivatization of the (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloadducts and late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the chemoselectivity were investigated by means of density functional theory calculations.

&lt;p&gt;New synthons, acceptor-acceptor bicyclobutanes, and a novel cycloaddition strategy involving Lewis base catalysis have been introduced into the cycloaddition chemistry of BCBs, thereby expanding the toolkit for synthesizing pharmaceutically valuable bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the advent of various state-of-the-art strategies, the utilization of donor-acceptor bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a three-atom component in (3&#160;+&#160;X) cycloaddition reactions has emerged as a highly efficient platform for constructing saturated bicyclic scaffolds that can serve as arene bioisosteres. However, the application of Lewis base catalysis in such reactions remains underexplored, and the strategy for the cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs remains unknown. Herein, we report the first formal (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs, which serve as a four-atom component, for the selective synthesis of pharmaceutically valuable oxa-bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (oxa-BCHeps) enabled by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. BCBs and carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, with various functional groups, are well-tolerated under mild conditions, yielding oxa-BCHeps with up to 87% yield, competing with at least five side reactions. The versatility of this synthetic method is further demonstrated through derivatization of the (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloadducts and late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the chemoselectivity were investigated by means of density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Engineering of Solvent Molecules for High&#8208;Voltage and Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a conformation engineering strategy with unique chair conformation and perfluorinated substitution, thus realizing the dual advantages of low&#8208;polar solvation environments and anion&#8208;rich solvent sheaths to effectively reduce the dissolution energy and enhance the interfacial stability of Li+ solvation energy and interfacial stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are crucial for overcoming electric vehicle range and charging limitations. However, conventional carbonate electrolytes face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and lithium metal anodes. These limitations arise from sluggish Li+ transport kinetics and parasitic side reactions, both largely driven by excessive Li+ solvation energy inherent to carbonates. To address these challenges, we propose a conformational engineering strategy of fluorinated solvent molecules by developing a 2,2,3,3,4,4&#8208;hexafluoropentanedioic&#183;anhydride (HFPA)&#8208;derived electrolyte (HFPE). The chair conformation of HFPA synergizes with its high F/C ratio to establish a low&#8208;polarity solvation environment, effectively reducing desolvation energy barriers. In addition, the HFPA&#8208;induced ligand preference for anion aggregation contributes to the formation of anion&#8208;rich dissolved sheaths while stabilizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases. The engineered HFPE demonstrates accelerated interfacial ion transport kinetics with an enhanced Li+ transference number of 0.64. When paired with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes under stringent operating conditions (4.5&#160;V cut&#8208;off voltage, 10 C&#8208;rate), HFPE&#8208;enabled cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability. Notably, industrial&#8208;scale 5.6 Ah lithium metal pouch cells employing HFPE maintain stable operation at 4.5&#160;V, underscoring the practical viability of this conformation modulation approach. This work establishes a paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design in practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation in&#160;Porous Organic Cage Salt&#8211;Metal Cluster Hybrids&#160;for Efficient Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial biomimetic catalysts with precise spatiotemporal control remains challenging. Here, we present a pH&#8208;responsive organic cage salt  containing quaternary ammonium moieties ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8208;12X, X = Cl or Br counteranions) as a platform for constructing such catalysts. Thermally induced electron transfer from counteranions to ammonium moieties generates radicals throughout cage skeletons ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X), which, combined with nanocavity confinement, facilitates metal precursor reduction and Pd cluster encapsulation, yielding the hybrid catalyst, Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X. The pH&#8208;responsive cages enable switching between two catalytic states: Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X, where radicals serve as active sites while Pd accessibility is hindered by numerous counteranions, and Pd@A&#8208;Cage, where neutralization of ammonium cages to non&#8208;radical amine cages (A&#8208;Cage) restores Pd accessibility by removing counteranions and modulating Pd surface charge. This dynamic switching allows real&#8208;time modulation of site&#8208;specific activity in single&#8208;step reactions. Sequential activation of dual active sites by acid&#8208;base stimuli enables tandem catalysis. Moreover, fine&#8208;tuning the protonation degrees of quaternary ammonium groups with base stimuli unveils an optimized catalyst, Pd@[PQA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;6X (where PQA&#8208;Cage refers to partially quaternized ammonium cages). Such a spatiotemporal control maximizes cooperative performance by balancing spatially isolated radicals and Pd sites for efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of incompatible oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;activity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment&#8217;s homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multi&#8208;enzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The loposomes were fabricated through the self&#8208;assembly of artificial membrane on CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO2 nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine Monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. This work advances the development of cell&#8208;like entities capable of modulating signaling communication between living and abiotic interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Acetylene Insertion and Ammonia Activation at a Digallene and Diindene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequential [2+2] cycloaddition reactions between acetylene and the digallene and diindene compounds (ETer)2 (E = Ga, In; Ter = 2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) are described. Careful control of the reaction conditions leads to selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores, respectively. A structural analysis of the heterocycles by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests limited electronic delocalization within the rings, which is borne out in their reactivity. For example, the six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues exhibit Lewis&#8208;acidic behavior and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia. Upon heating, these adducts transform into the corresponding bimetallic triel amides with concomitant generation of ethene.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Single&#8208;atom Site to Dual&#8208;atom Site in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst is the most promising non&#8208;noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long&#8208;term stability. &#160;Here, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the pre&#8208;synthesized Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts in a H2/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#8208;N bonds near the FeN4 sites, while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe2N6 sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe2N6 sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR, and produces negligible H2O2 (&lt; 1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe de&#8208;metalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1 M HClO4 after 80,000 potential cycles. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst can effectively decompose H2O2 with a high decomposition rate of 15.7 mmol min&#8315;1, approaching that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Pt/C catalyst (17 mmol min&#8315;1). As a result, the transformed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst assembled PEMFC operates stably for 300 h with only 7% current density attenuation, while that of the pristine Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst&#8208;based device declines by 84% within 100 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Dual&#8208;Center Coupled Synergistic Catalysis for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) suffers from inherent kinetic limitations arising from the competitive adsorption behavior of *OOH intermediates and their divergent conversion pathways toward either the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant route or the 2e&#8315;&#8208;peroxide byproduct. Conventional single&#8208;component catalysts fundamentally lack temporal&#8210;spatial control to simultaneously accelerate O&#8210;O bond cleavage while suppressing *H2O2 desorption. To overcome this kinetic dilemma, herein, we propose a dynamically dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism enabled by precisely engineered PdRh&#8208;Pt nanosheet binary&#8208;component interfaces. Multidimensional in situ synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the activated 4e&#8315; pathway primarily occurs at PdRh sites. Additionally, Pt centers selectively reduce *OOH to *O and *H2O2, whereas neighboring PdRh sites facilitate ultrafast *H2O2 migration and dissociation, effectively complementing the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant pathway. Hence, the DCCS catalysis redirects traditionally divergent product pathways toward a singular target product. This interfacial kinetic synergy achieves ultrahigh 4e&#8315; kinetics, demonstrated by a six&#8208;fold increase of turnover frequency compared to that of Pt/C. Moreover, the derived rechargeable Zn&#8210;air batteries demonstrate exceptional stability over 200 hours, establishing a new design principle for breaking kinetics trade&#8208;offs in heterogeneous catalysis through molecularly scheduling reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically recyclable alternating poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with tunable properties enabled by substitution effects and stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative poly(ether&#8208;ester)s with perfectly alternating ether and ester functionalities to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Herein, we prepared a series of enantiopure cyclic thioether&#8208;ester monomers bearing various pendant substituents by a facile &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8221; strategy. The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers will afford stereoregular poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structural diversity. The varieties of substituent size, position and stereo&#8208;configuration provide the opportunity to systematically investigate polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as structure&#8208;properties relationship for the resulting poly(thiother&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. Of note, these polymers can be chemically recycled by either ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or anchylosis, with high monomer regeneration efficiency. The systematic investigation of substitution effects and structure&#8208;property relationships in this work provides a molecular blueprint for designing novel chemically recyclable polymers with high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Oxygen Vacancy Clusters Enhanced Catalytic Activity of CeO2&#160;Nanorods on CO2&#160; Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing heterogeneous halogen&#8208;free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO2 and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom&#8208;economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere&#8208;assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO2 nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO2 cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO2via a synergistic &#8220;compression&#8208;expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO2 cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 at 110oC. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#8211;S Cross&#8208;Coupling via Engineered Frustrated Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs for High&#8208;Efficiency Methanesulfonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of sulfonyl compounds under mild conditions remains a significant challenge due to the reliance on harsh reagents, high energy consumption, and low selectivity in conventional methods. Herein, we report a novel strategy for efficient C&#8211;S bond formation through in situ modulation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs within a copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CuBDC&#8208;XN). By precisely engineering electron&#8208;deficient Cu Lewis acid sites and electron&#8208;rich XN&#8208;functionalized Lewis base sites, this bifunctional catalyst enables the synergistic co&#8208;reduction of SO32&#8208; and CO2 into methanesulfonate (MS) at ambient conditions with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.77% (&#8722;0.78 V vs. RHE). Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis pairs selectively stabilize key intermediates (*CHO and SO32&#8208;) via electrostatic interactions, facilitating nucleophilic attack and C&#8211;S coupling with a reduced energy barrier (0.48 eV). In situ spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations further elucidate the dynamic adsorption&#8208;configuration regulation and intermediate evolution pathway. This work not only establishes a molecular&#8208;level understanding of cooperative Lewis acid&#8208;base catalysis but also provides a universal design principle for the sustainable electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added organosulfur compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Dual Recycling in Photo&#8208;Curable Polycyanurate Thermosets Derived from Bio&#8208;Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyanurate thermosets are extensively utilized in high&#8208;performance applications due to their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, their inherently crosslinked nature has traditionally rendered them non&#8208;recyclable, limiting their sustainability. Recent studies have demonstrated that these networks can undergo dynamic rearrangement under specific conditions, enabling reversibility. In this study, a bio&#8208;derived cyanurate monomer from eugenol was synthesized and polymerized via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization, yielding recyclable polycyanurate thermosets with robust material properties. The dynamic character of these networks was leveraged through nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) chemistry, unlocking two distinct recycling pathways: (i) selective monomer recovery and (ii) closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. Depolymerization in the presence of eugenol enabled the selective recovery of well&#8208;defined monomeric components, while phenol&#8208;mediated cleavage facilitated polymer breakdown into chemically recyclable intermediates, which were directly reassembled into reformed thermosets. Both recycling pathways resulted in regenerated polymers that retained their original thermal, mechanical, and thermomechanical properties, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of this approach. By establishing a controlled depolymerization and reassembly framework, this study introduces a sustainable design strategy for achieving closed&#8208;loop recycling in high&#8208;performance thermosets, providing a scalable pathway toward circular polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando XAFS Deciphering Dynamic Evolution of Heteronuclear Cu&#8208;Ni from Atomic Sites to Atomic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Revealing the dynamic evolution of atomic&#8208;level active sites during catalytic reactions is critical for identifying true catalytic centers and optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, elucidating the dynamic atomic/electronic transformation mechanisms of metal sites in multimetallic systems, and achieving atomic&#8208;level control, remains challenging. Here, we report a potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction intrinsic to Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear atomic sites during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and microscopy unveil the transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8208;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8208;Ni ACs, x = 3&#8211;7) at potentials from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.2 V versus RHE, anchored on porous carbon through N/S coordination. The Cu&#8208;rich evolution reshapes geometric structures of active sites, inducing gradual electron localization, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 intermediates as evidenced by operando measurements and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the tailored Cu5&#8208;Ni ACs formed at &#8722;0.9 V reduce the antibonding orbital occupancy between Cu 3d and C 2p states, facilitating CO2 protonation and enhancing eCO2RR kinetics. These findings demonstrate high CO selectivity and catalytic stability, providing fundamental insights into the dynamic reconstruction and catalytic mechanism of atomic&#8208;scale active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Hole&#8208;Selective Molecules for UV&#8208;Resistant High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced degradation, particularly occurs at buried interface, has emerged as a significant stability challenge, severely limiting the widespread applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we rationally design and synthesize novel thiophene&#8208;modified self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated hole&#8208;selective molecules, namely (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;TPCP), affording UV&#8208;stable high&#8208;efficiency PSCs. Simultaneously incorporating phenyl and thiophene groups enhances molecular conjugation, effectively protecting the fragile bonds between the carbazole core and the phosphonic acid group. This modification results in enhanced intrinsic UV stability and improved hole transport ability of the molecule. Furthermore, thiophene grafted on the carbazole coordinates with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, enhancing the binding of perovskite on hole&#8208;selective molecules. Consequently, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, along with decreased defect density, thereby inhibiting its degradation under UV light illumination. By introducing methyl groups, the molecular stability is further enhanced, and the energy level of Me&#8208;TPCP is finely tuned, resulting in a lower interfacial energy barrier that facilitates more efficient hole extraction. With these advantages, inverted PSC devices based on Me&#8208;TPCP achieve a significantly higher efficiency of 25.62% than the control devices (23.85%). Meanwhile, these devices demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in UV stability, as well as improved operational and thermal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Reconstruction of Calicheamicin &#947;1I Iodo&#8208;thiobenzoate by Selective Carrier Protein Trapping Reveals a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Iodinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases play important roles in natural product biosynthesis, particularly chlorinases and brominases. Apart from ubiquitous mammalian iodination in thyroxine biosynthesis, iodinated natural products are extremely rare, and enzymes responsible for iodination are even less well described. A notable exception is calicheamicin &#947;1I, a potent antitumor compound containing an aromatic iodide, for which a halogenase has been proposed to mediate iodine incorporation. Despite predictions regarding the enzymes involved in iodinated aryl ring biosynthesis, experimental evidence remains limited due to challenges in substrate identification and reaction monitoring. In this study, we successfully reconstituted the enzymatic activities required for iodination and all embellishments of the highly substituted benzene ring in calicheamicin &#947;1I. Using intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometry combined with protease cleavage, we demonstrated formation of the orsellinate thioester followed by sequential C&#8208;2 O&#8208;methylation, C&#8208;5 iodination, C&#8208;3 oxidation, and C&#8208;3 O&#8208;methylation. This research characterizes the first flavin&#8208;dependent iodinase that acts on a carrier protein&#8208;dependent substrate, identifies the natural substrates of a cytochrome P450 oxygenase and two O&#8208;methyltransferases, and provides valuable insights for biocatalysis. Additionally, these findings could facilitate the engineering of other polyketide biosynthetic pathways and could contribute to optimizing fermentation conditions to generate new calicheamicin derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: A Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Assisted Dual&#8208;Site Synergy Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The persistent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity remains a critical barrier to efficient CO2 valorization. Herein, we propose a concept of decoupling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the photothermal catalytic reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy. This concept is demonstrated through a hybrid catalyst constructed by immobilizing abundant Ru single sites and trace Ru clusters onto high&#8208;efficiency photothermal support of N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hNCNC). Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#8208;N4 sites are highly active and selective for the RWGS reaction, contingent on the efficient migration of dissociated *H species to adjacent C atoms of Ru. Combined with a series of advanced characterizations, we confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO2 hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H2 activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1 mol&#183;gRu&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO2 hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen&#8208;spillover&#8208;active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Photocatalysis with Chiral Lewis Acid Catalysis for Enantioselective Hydrosilylation/Hydrogermylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilicon compounds demonstrate widespread applications in many fields. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation represents one of the most common and effective methods to synthesize chiral organosilicon compounds, but it largely relies on electron&#8208;rich alkenes and structurally specific hydrosilanes. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a promising new platform for hydrosilylation. However, the enantiocontrol of photoinduced asymmetric hydrosilylation concerning highly reactive radical species is a great challenge. Herein, we report a synergistic catalytic strategy for enantioselective hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes by merging anthraquinone as a dual&#8208;tasked photocatalyst with a chiral Lewis acid catalyst. This protocol shows broad hydrosilane scope with efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, delivering diverse enantioenriched organosilicon compounds, which could be readily converted into a series of medicine molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the photocatalyst and the alkene is crucial for enantiocontrol. Additionally, enantioselective radical hydrogermylation was also achieved under the visible light photoinduced synergistic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conditional Stabilization of the Hypoxia&#8208;Inducible Factor HIF1&#945; &#8212; Photoswitchable Stapled Peptides Prevent Elongin BC Mediated Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen levels and its distribution are tightly regulated due to their critical impact on health. Hypoxia&#8208;inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1&#945;&#8208;target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PSB&#8208;BCB&#8208;04 stabilized HIF1&#945; under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC (ki = 7.9 &#177; 1.3 nM) and preventing VHL&#8208;mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a 7&#8208;fold difference in its EloBC&#8208;binding capacity. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1&#945; degradation enabled isomer&#8208;specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1&#945; and provided a new toolbox for on&#8208;demand photocontrol over the HIF&#8208;signalling pathway as well as VHL&#8208;mediated degradation.</dc:description>

Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1&#945;-target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PSB-BCB-04 stabilized HIF1&#945; under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC (ki = 7.9 &#177; 1.3 nM) and preventing VHL-mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a 7-fold difference in its EloBC-binding capacity. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1&#945; degradation enabled isomer-specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1&#945; and provided a new toolbox for on-demand photocontrol over the HIF-signalling pathway as well as VHL-mediated degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Alkylidene Succinimides Enabled by Weak Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts based on Earth&#8208;abundant&#160;metals presents a sustainable alternative to efficient but resource&#8208;limited rare&#8208;metal systems. However, these catalysts often suffer from low catalytic activity. In this study, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic experiments, we uncovered a positive correlation between catalyst&#8208;substrate weak noncovalent interactions and catalytic efficiency in the enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides with different N&#8208;protecting groups. The tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituent emerged as the optimal choice, significantly enhancing reactivity. This approach enabled the hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates with excellent yields (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee), achieving a substrate/catalyst (S/C) ratio of 4000&#8212;twice the efficiency of rare&#8208;metal catalysts (S/C &#8804; 2000) for similar transformations. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the enantiomers revealed that the high stereoselectivity is promoted by stabilizing weak noncovalent interactions in the R&#8208;configured transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Active Site Evolution in Lanthanum&#8208;Based Catalysts Dictates Ethane Chlorination Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over&#8208;chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl2&#8208;rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl&#8594;LaCl3 transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane via hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, thereby activating C&#8208;Cl over&#8208; chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al2O3&#8208;supported LaCl3 model catalysts, the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl3 species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer&#8208;dispersed LaCl3 species generates empty 4f&#8208;states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles act as spectators due to restricted Cl radical access. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum&#8208;catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalysts design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOClx species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Chemical Scissors Strategy Enables 1D Antimony Selenates with Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational, function&#8208;driven design of advanced inorganic functional materials remains a significant challenge, primarily attributed to their inherently complex and highly connected three&#8208;dimensional frameworks of most oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, we report a &#8220;dual chemical scissors&#8221; strategy that synergistically combines the effects of fluoride ions and stereochemically active lone pairs to precisely modulate local coordination environments and enable controlled dimensional reduction. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized the first series of noncentrosymmetric one&#8208;dimensional antimony selenates&#8722;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III). These compounds feature well&#8208;defined helical chain structures constructed from SbOxFy polyhedra and SeO4 tetrahedra, resulting in pronounced optical anisotropy and robust nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8722;10 &#956;m), a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.4 &#215; KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546 nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for ultraviolet NLO applications. This work establishes a powerful and generalizable structural design paradigm for constructing polar low&#8208;dimensional architectures and underscores the effectiveness of targeted coordination modulation in advancing high&#8208;performance optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Driven by Efficient Nitrate Reduction via Bimetallic Iron/Zinc Polyphthalocyanine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Freshwater scarcity and nitrate contamination in water sources are critical environmental sustainability challenges. We address these two challenges by coupling seawater desalination with electrochemical&#160;NO3RR&#160;via bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks. They serve as high&#8208;performance catalysts for NO3RR toward NH3&#160;production. The efficient NO3RR is integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, enabling the production of freshwater from seawater and the removal of nitrate from contaminated water. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that Zn&#8208;N4 units incorporated into the Fe polyphthalocyanine framework modulate Fe&#8208;N4 sites&#8217;&#160;d&#8208;band center to enhance the adsorption of NO3&#8722; and the generation of *H, resulting in 3.22 times higher turnover frequency and highly selective reduction toward NH3. The optimized Fe8Zn1PPc delivered NH3 Faradic efficiency (&gt;97% over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.95 V vs. RHE), the NH3 yield rate of 2.68 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at &#8722;0.85 V vs. RHE, and over 120 h of stable operation, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts for NO3RR. The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92 &#956;g cm&#8722;2 min&#8722;1) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal. This work presents an innovative solution for addressing sustainable water challenges.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is of great interest due to their applications in optoelectronics. However, improving RTP in pure organic materials by controlling triplet excitons is challenging due to their complex relaxation processes. Therefore, exploring effective strategies to modulate triplet excitons is crucial. Herein, we propose a N&#8208;B&#8208;N isomerization strategy to enhance RTP performance. Two isomers containing HN&#8208;B&#8208;NH units (B2{1,2&#8208;(NH)2C6H4}2), namely 1,1&#8208;DB and 1,2&#8208;DB, were synthesized to explore their RTP properties. Intriguingly, 1,1&#8208;DB exhibited excellent RTP, whereas 1,2&#8208;DB displayed negligible phosphorescence. The N&#8208;B&#8208;N unit in 1,1&#8208;DB optimizes molecular configuration and interactions, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing triplet excitons, which improves intersystem crossing (ISC) and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) while reducing nonradiative decay, thus enabling RTP. Additionally, based on phosphorescence resonance energy transfer, multicolor afterglows were achieved by doping fluorescein into 1,1&#8208;DB. This work not only provides a new class of RTP materials but also offers valuable insights for the discovery and optimization of rational designs in RTP materials, potentially triggering the exploration of new functions and properties within boron&#8208;nitrogen molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Cathode Interlayer Engineering Enables over 20% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capability of cathode interlayer (CIL) in regulating the conductivity, interfacial dipole, and work function of electrode plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The widely used perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs suffered from the inbuilt limitation of finite conductivity and poor thickness tolerance. To address this issue, we develop a universal strategy to finely optimize the functionality of perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;type CIL (PDINN) by incorporating polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative to form hybrid CIL. It is found that the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PDINN and CuPc can address the solvent processability issue of CuPc used as CIL. The incorporation of CuPc in the PDINN layer leads to better film morphology, increased conductivity, and reduced cathode work function, enabling greater CIL thickness tolerance and significantly improved photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Notably, the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device using PDINN:F16CuPc as hybrid CIL yields a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.17%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 19.29% for the control device based on PDINN CIL. Particularly, this strategy demonstrates a universality in multiple photoactive layers and various perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs, offering an effective approach to developing highly efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208; and NIR&#8208;active Iron(III) Triradicals as Catalysts for Radical Polymerization of Acrylamides and Methacrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two unprecedented redox&#8208;active, low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complexes, [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC=S&#8226;&#8722;)3]&#8729;NHC=S (1&#8729;NHC=S; E = S) and [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC=Se&#8226;&#8722;)3] (2; E = Se) have been synthesized and structurally characterized by SCXRD. They were further characterized spectroscopically using IR, Raman, EPR, and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. The low&#8208;spin electronic configuration of the central Fe(III) ion (1) and the nature of the magnetic interaction between the Fe(III) centre and the three unpaired electrons in 1 have been investigated by magnetic measurements. In addition, the bonding stability and electron density distribution in 1 were studied by quantum chemical calculations and correlated with experimental results. Finally, a series of well&#8208;defined functional homopolymers were synthesized via catalytic polymerization reactions using [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC=S&#8226;&#8722;)3] (1) as a catalyst at ambient temperature. These reactions yielded poly(N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide), poly(N, N&#8208;dimethyl isopropyl acrylamide), poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate), and poly(benzyl methacrylate) with low disparities ranging from 1.2 to 1.22. The synthesis of various diblock copolymers was confirmed to have excellent chain&#8208;end precision. These homopolymers and diblock copolymers highlight the versatile catalytic polymerization reactions of these Fe&#8208;radical complexes. Herein, we present a report on the polymerization of various acrylamides and methacrylates using a redox&#8208;active Fe&#8208;dithiolene complex for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;Like Fluorescent Tracker for Dynamic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamics of reversible polymerization could be visualized using a butterfly&#8208;shaped fluorescent tracker. The emission color showed strong dependence on the microenvironmental confinement within the dynamic polymers, correlating with molecular weight, backbone structure, conformation, and aggregation state. The dynamic polymerization of poly(disulfide)s could be tracked via the multicolored emission of the fluorescent probe, demonstrating high sensitivity to a wide range of poly(disulfide)s.








Abstract
Optically tracking constitutional dynamics provides a time&#8208;resolved, non&#8208;invasive, and visually interpretable approach to unraveling microscopic complexity in system chemistry. Here we report a butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent tracker, featuring excited&#8208;state conformational adaptivity, capable of sensing the subtle microscopic dynamics of polymers as a ratiometric fluorescent probe. The key design is coupling the fluorophore's conformational relaxation dynamics to microenvironmental constraints imposed by polymer structural features&#8212;such as chain length, conformation, and inter&#8208;/intramolecular interactions. By employing the fluorophore as a bifunctional initiator, we grafted two dynamic polymer chains onto its phenyl &#8220;wings&#8221;, creating a single&#8208;fluorophore tracker that dynamically interacts with its environment. This system functions as a highly sensitive ratiometric probe, optically reporting microscopic polymer dynamics in real time, including polymerization kinetics, chain folding/unfolding transitions, and depolymerization processes. Systematic studies demonstrate the broad applicability of this concept across diverse polymeric systems, with distinct emission signatures enabling differentiation between systems. The probe's ability to correlate fluorescence output with microenvironmental changes reveals its utility in both fundamental and applied contexts. We anticipate this conformationally adaptive fluorescent platform will advance research in dynamic chemistry, particularly for real&#8208;time monitoring of polymeric systems and the development of responsive materials.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Fixation into Dimethyl Carbonate via Multiple Active Sites Constituted by VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O Vacancy Clusters on Single&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell CeO2 Nano&#8208;Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy engineering was employed to precisely design and construct the unique structure of Ce1&#8208;&#948;O2&#8208;x atomic layers (thickness: about 0.65&#160;nm) with enriched vacancy clusters comprising of cationic&#8208;anion defects. These unique vacancy&#8208;cluster sties facilitate the synergistic activation of CO2/CH3OH, enhancing the formation of key intermediates for the highly efficient synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (31.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1).








Abstract
The thermodynamic stability and intrinsic kinetic inertia of CO2 present a critical challenge for its effective activation in the synthesis of high&#8208;value dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In this work, we report the fabrication of novel O&#8208;Ce&#8208;O vacancy clusters (VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O) incorporated into CeO2 nano&#8208;sheets with a near single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thickness to construct atomically adjacent multiple active sites on their surfaces. These active sites significantly enhance the activation of both CO2 and CH3OH. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared CeO2 with VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O catalyst exhibits an excellent DMC yield of 31.2&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1, surpassing previously reported Ce&#8208;based catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy increases the reducibility of lattice oxygen, facilitating CO2 activation, while cerium vacancies weaken the *CH3O adsorption, promoting the coupling reaction between *CH3O and *CO2 to form the intermediate (*CH3OC(O)2). Notably, the formation of vacancy clusters reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;controlled step (*CH3OC(O)2 dissociation to *CH3OCO), thereby boosting the DMC yield. Our new findings provide valuable insights into surface engineering and active site modulation of cerium&#8208;based catalysts, offering a viable pathway for green resource utilization of CO2.

         <title>Controlling the Helicity and Handedness of Polyaromatics with Isobenzofuranophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isobenzofuranophanes are introduced as helical synthons that enable late&#8208;stage helicity induction and control in polyaromatics. This remote tethering approach allows precise control over the handedness and pitch of [5]helicenes via the tether length, inducing significant molecular distortion and affecting chiroptical properties.








Abstract
The extent of helicity in nonplanar polyaromatic materials affects their electronic, optical and chiroptical properties. However, controlling helicity in different systems typically requires different multistep synthetic approaches for each target compound, often with significant complexity, thereby limiting its applicability. Here, we introduce a helical synthon, isobenzofuranophane, with either a short or long tether, which enables late&#8208;stage helicity induction and control in aromatic frameworks. We demonstrate the applicability of this synthon by reacting it with a [5]helicene aryne precursor, where both the handedness and helicene pitch are remotely&#8208;controlled by the tether length, directly affecting the (chiro)optical properties of the helicene. The X&#8208;ray structures support these findings with up to 35&#176; torsion for a single benzene ring, demonstrating the potential of isobenzofuranophane to induce significant curvature to polyaromatic molecules.

         <title>An Oxidative Stress Nanoamplifier to Enhance the Efficacy of Cisplatin in Head and Neck Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative stress nanoamplifier (FPLC@IR OSNA) released cinnamaldehyde in acidic conditions, leading to the production of hydrogen peroxide to break down into oxygen, further improving phototherapy efficacy by IR780 irradiation. This process significantly reduced glutathione levels by the bioreduction of pimonidazole and downregulated the nucleotide excision repair pathway by reactive oxygen, increasing cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Cisplatin (CP) is a first&#8208;line platinum&#8208;based drug used for the treatment of head and neck cancer. However, tumor cells can diminish the therapeutic effects of CP through the detoxification system mediated by glutathione (GSH) and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Herein, we present a light&#8208;activable and pH&#8208;responsive oxidative stress nanoamplifier (FPLC@IR OSNA), comprising an amphiphilic compound (FPLC) with Fmoc&#8208;lysine acting as a connector between a nitroimidazole derivative and a pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA) derivative, loaded with photosensitizer IR780. The acidic microenvironment of the lysosome can trigger the release of CA to produce H2O2, which breaks down into oxygen, further improving the phototherapy efficacy mediated by IR780 irradiation. The consumption of oxygen during the phototherapy process induces hypoxia, prompting the reduction of nitroimidazole to aminoimidazole and leading to reduced GSH synthesis, enhancing tumor cell death induced by CP. Meanwhile, the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) during phototherapy attenuates the nuclear NER pathway, further augmenting the therapy effect of CP. This strategy, by combining FPLC@IR OSNA with laser and CP, significantly promotes the therapeutic effect in vitro and notably inhibits tumor growth in both Cal27 cell line&#8208;derived xenograft models and patient&#8208;derived xenograft models.

         <title>Rapid Methylation of Aryl Bromides Using Air&#8208;Stable DABCO&#8208;Bis(Trimethylaluminum) via Nickel Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of bis(trimethylaluminum)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABAl&#8208;Me3) as practical source of radicals for the introduction of valuable methyl groups to aryl bromides via a Nickel/metallaphotocatalytic cross coupling strategy.








Abstract
We report a metallaphotocatalytic strategy for the selective methylation of (hetero)aryl bromides via nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with bis(trimethylaluminum)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABAl&#8208;Me&#8323;), as a commercially available, air&#8208;stable, and non&#8208;pyrophoric aluminum&#8208;based reagent. The method enables a fast, robust, and scalable methylation protocol that broadly accommodates various functional groups while preventing protodehalogenation. Mechanistic studies confirm the unprecedented generation of methyl radicals from an organo&#8208;aluminum precursor under photoredox conditions, bypassing the limitations of conventional two&#8208;electron pathways. This work expands the toolbox of practical radical precursors and provides a streamlined approach for selective C(sp2)&#9472;CH3 bond formation.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;&#8208;systems. This &#960;&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#8211;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;based Multiblock Copolymers from Cascade ROMP&#8208;RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic disposal has become a serious environmental and social problem. Mechanical recycling of waste plastics is the most widely adopted strategy to address this issue, but if used to recycle mixed plastics, it usually requires the addition of amphiphilic block copolymers. Polyolefins account for almost half of all synthetic plastics, making them ubiquitous in the plastic waste stream. Within this perspective, polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers are highly desirable, but they are difficult to access using traditional strategies. In this contribution, a cascade ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization strategy was developed to prepare various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with tunable polar segments and microstructures. Using this strategy, tunable amounts of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agents were installed in the polyolefin main chain via ROMP. Subsequent chain extension of various polar vinyl monomers via controlled RAFT polymerization formed various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with high molecular weight and good physical properties. These multiblock copolymers were used to compatibilize and upcycle mixtures of high&#8208;density polyethylene/polymethyl methacrylate (HDPE/PMMA) and high&#8208;density polyethylene/polyethylene terephthalate (HDPE/PET).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process produces mixtures of ethylene and propylene, driving demand for high&#8208;performance separation materials. We present HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework built from an expanded BTB (4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl&#8208;tribenzoate) linker, featuring the highest catenation degree observed in BTB&#8208;based HOFs. This unique architecture confers good stability under solvent, pH, and thermal conditions. With optimally sized pores and aromatic&#8208;rich surfaces, HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 demonstrates excellent propylene/ethylene separation potential, outperforming its parent frameworks (HOF&#8208;BTB and HOF&#8208;BTB&#8208;NH2) under ambient conditions. Notably, the material accomplishes single&#8208;cycle purification of high&#8208;purity ethylene (99.95%) and propylene (99.5%) from equimolar binary mixtures, achieving a record ethylene productivity of 3.22 mol kg&#8208;1 among HOF adsorbents.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Monolayer&#8208;Decorated Nanopipette Enabling in Situ Monitoring of Single&#8208;Cell Redox Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth study of how single cells respond to redox perturbations is pivotal for predicting cell fate decisions. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;active nanopipettes hold promise for single&#8208;cell analysis, yet challenges remain in achieving both signal sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, a plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette has been developed, which serves as a biomimetic endoscope to monitor single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. This is accomplished by the conformal transferring of gold nanoparticle monolayer onto the nanopipette followed by the functionalization of redox&#8208;responsive probes.  The strong near&#8208;field coupling within monolayer forms uniform hotspots, enabling highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of SERS signals changes triggered by redox species. Modulated by the nanopipette technology, the endoscope allows for in situ monitoring of global redox states with low invasiveness and high spatial resolution. Further study of ferroptosis events via simultaneous optical and electrical recording elucidates the correlation between redox imbalance and membrane damage during various ferroptosis&#8208;inducers stimulation, which has not been observed at the single&#8208;cell level. This work provides profound insights into the cellular redox dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of related physiopathological pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile scaffolds for developing high&#8208;performance photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts. By enabling precise anchoring of metal species onto their cores, these COFs allow for meticulous tuning of their chemical and electronic properties, facilitating single&#8208;atom distribution and achieving outstanding catalytic performance. However, the majority of these frameworks are restricted to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures, where the catalytic activity of the metal centers is often compromised due to eclipsed stacking layers, limiting their optimization potential. To address this challenge, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with a cyt topology. This innovative structural arrangement facilitates the atomic&#8208;level distribution of distinct metal species across steric exposed networks, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic sites leads to exceptional electrocatalytic activity in urea oxidation reactions with a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at just 1.37 VRHE. This study not only broadens the topological diversity of 3D COFs but also establishes a facile platform for achieving uniform and accessible multi&#8208;metal distributions, paving the way for novel synergistic electrocatalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Hollow Microreactors with Catalytic Nanobrushes for Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micro/nanoreactors with hollow structures have traditionally focused on the design of the internal catalytic microenvironment, while precise engineering of their external surfaces at a nanoscale level is particularly rare. Here, we develop a unique approach to elaborately engineer the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;based hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures that serve as an external catalytic platform. This involves the anchoring of high&#8208;density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF&#8208;8 via surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff&#8208;like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#8208;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW12 nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Persistent Lithium Protection and Revival with Dissolution&#8208;Equilibrium&#8208;Driven Sustainable Additives Reservoir</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additives chemistry plays a pivotal role in enhancing the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries. Conventional additives with high solubility facilitate the formation of a stable interface in the early stages of cycling, but typically act as &#8220;sacrificial agents&#8221;, failing to maintain a durable interface over extended cycles. Herein, we demonstrate a sustainable strategy for lithium protection and retrieval, driven by an additive reservoir regulated by chemical dissolution equilibrium. A sparingly soluble AgI coating on the separator enables the continuous release of Ag&#8314; and I&#8315; ions. The Ag&#8314; ions facilitate the formation of a Li&#8208;Ag alloy interphase, promoting uniform lithium deposition, while the I&#8315; ions assist in the recovery of inactive lithium. With this strategy, symmetric Li||Li batteries deliver an extended cycle life over 1000 hours at 5 mA/cm2 with a capacity of 5 mAh/cm2. Additionally, practical pouch cells demonstrate a prolonged cycle life over 200 cycles with 82% capacity retention. This work offers new insights into additive chemistry and paves the way for the development of durable lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoy DNA protects molecular tension probes from DNase degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based molecular probes are essential tools for visualizing and quantifying mechanotransduction at the single&#8208;molecule level. However, their application in live&#8208;cell environments is severely limited by DNase&#8208;mediated degradation, which shortens probe lifespan and introduces false&#8208;positive signals. Here, we present a decoy DNA strategy where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA competitively binds DNases, effectively preserving functional DNA probes. This approach extends probe stability from 1&#8211;2 hours to beyond 24 hours, substantially improving signal integrity in live&#8208;cell tension imaging. In contrast to structurally modified nucleic acids, decoy DNA can be readily applied to existing DNA probe systems, enabling seamless integration without the need for additional validation or calibration. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy provides a generalizable framework for stabilizing DNA&#8208;based molecular tools in DNase&#8208;rich environments, enabling high&#8208;precision mechanobiology studies across diverse cell types and extended experiment durations.</dc:description>

         <title>Is a Malleable Active Site Loop the Key to High Substrate Promiscuity?

Hybrid, Biocatalytic Route to Structurally Diverse Taxoid Side Chains with Remarkable Dual Stereocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>These studies reveal the first structure of Clostridiumacetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH), a protein exhibiting remarkable substrate promiscuity and stereochemical fidelity. The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxot&#232;re family of tubulin&#8208;binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters, showing high D&#8208;syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant Milataxel (Ar = 2&#8208;furyl) and Simotaxel (Ar = 2&#8208;thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross&#8208;coupling chemistries performed on the p&#8208;bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti&#8208;conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site, likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an (S)&#8208;configured C&#8208;Cl bond, in addition to the D&#8208;facial selectivity, demonstrated across twenty diverse substrates by this remarkable short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Seeding, Acid Stalling, and Solidifying: Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Nonclassical Pathways in Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic gels (MOGs), an innovative subset of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), feature hierarchically porous architecture and self&#8208;shaping monolithic morphologies, demonstrating them significant potential for advanced applications in catalysis, gas storage, and energy conversion. Despite their functional versatility, the synthesis of MOGs remains empirical, as the actual formation mechanisms are largely unexplored. Here, a multiscale characterization strategy integrating time&#8208;resolved in&#8208;situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) analyses are systematically employed to elucidate the formation mechanism of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gel. The synthetic techniques provide a multidimensional perspective: (1) At the mesoscale, self&#8208;induced heterogeneous nucleation triggers a rapid evolution from linear pre&#8208;nucleation clusters to a 3D fractal network governed by autocatalytic hydrolysis of Zr precursors. (2) At the atomic level, the reorganization of Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and the substitution of coordinating H2O molecules and chloride ions with terephthalate ligands over prolonged timescales are uncovered. Crucially, in&#8208;situ generated acid&#8208;mediated coordination suppression emerges as a pivotal factor preventing the conversion of MOGs into their crystalline MOF counterparts. These findings highlight a non&#8208;classical evolution pathways distinct from classical MOF crystallization, thereby providing a mechanistic foundation for tailoring MOGs with programmable morphological and structural attributes.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulating Ionophores in Zeolite Imidazolate Framework&#8208;8 for Long&#8208;term Monitoring of Ion Fluctuations in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+ and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physio&#8208;pathological processes. Real&#8208;time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long&#8208;term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion&#8208;selective microsensor for long&#8208;term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long&#8208;term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer&#8208;based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.</dc:description>

         <title>Resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) for personalized cancer immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer nanovaccine has emerged as a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy due to its capability of eliciting robust tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. However, structural complexity and insufficient spatiotemporal coordination of immune activation pose substantial challenges for optimizing the therapeutic potential of nanovaccines. Herein, a resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) is devised for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) was covalently conjugated to fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer through a disulfide linker to obtain the vaccine carrier G5&#8208;R848. In this design, R848 not only fulfills its biological role as a vaccine adjuvant, but facilitates uniform nanovaccine formation with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) due to its distinctive chemical structure. Redox&#8208;triggered intracellular R848 release further promotes cytosolic delivery of antigen and subsequent antigen cross&#8208;presentation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanovaccine induces remarkable prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the B16F10&#8208;OVA melanoma model. Moreover, G5&#8208;R848 forms personalized nanovaccines by complexing with cell lysates from resected B16F10 and 4T1 tumor tissues, effectively inhibiting postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.</dc:description>

This all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration enables floating FMTAPPC to maximize sunlight utilization for interface micro&#8208;environment regulation and adsorbate binding optimization via photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activation while satisfying paradoxical wetting requirements of OER/ORR, which tunes&#160;reaction kinetics and intermediate energetics to remarkably promote&#160;both OER/ORR in neutral media.

         <title>Corrosion of Calcium Metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc Electrolyte and its Solution  via  Alloy Interface and Competitive Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity and the abundance of calcium, but suffer from the incompatible electrolyte with calcium metal. Here, we unveil two types of corrosion of calcium metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc electrolytes: native passivation from solvent reduction during aging and electrochemical corrosion from anion decomposition. The native passivation layer shows cracks in the calcium metal surface and the passivation layer aggravates the electrochemical corrosion by the decomposition of TSFI&#8722; to the large grain Ca2+&#8208;insulator CaF2, leading to the calcium metal battery failure. We introduce bifunctional SnI2 electrolyte additive to simultaneously mitigate both corrosions. The Sn2+ cations facilitate the spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction to form the Ca&#8208;Sn alloy, inhibiting native passivation, while the I&#8722; anions replace TSFI&#8722; to participate in the Ca2+ primary solvation shell and prevent the electrochemical TSFI&#8722; decomposition. By taking advantage of those features above, over 500 hours of stable cycling with a reduced overpotential of 0.33 V at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 were achieved, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ca(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolytes. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of corrosion at calcium metal surface and will guide suitable electrolyte design for anti&#8208;corrosion in metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelation&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Design for Enhanced Interface and Electrochemical Window in Aqueous Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelating agents have been reported as effective electrolyte additives in aqueous aluminum batteries. Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), in particular, is believed to reshape the solvation structure, thereby enabling a wider electrochemical window. Additionally, it can participate in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the aluminum surface, evidenced by atom probe topography (APT), effectively protecting the electrode from corrosion. Aqueous aluminum&#8211;organic batteries utilizing this electrolyte containing BMEA demonstrate high specific capacity and stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries have garnered significant attention owing to the abundance of aluminum resources, high theoretical specific capacity, and excellent safety. However, challenges such as electrolyte&#8208;induced water decomposition, aluminum anode corrosion, and electrode material compatibility continue to constrain their performance. In this study, we restructured the solvation environment using the chelating reagent Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), achieving an expanded electrochemical window of 2.2&#160;V and mitigating hydrogen evolution side reactions. Advanced atom probe tomography analysis confirmed that BMEA actively participates in the formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), effectively preventing aluminum surface corrosion and extending the cycle life of the aluminum anode. Employed as a BMEA&#8208;containing electrolyte in aluminum&#8211;organic batteries, the resulting Al||Tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCB) battery delivered a high capacity of 218.0&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and demonstrated stable cycling over 300 cycles. This study highlights the potential of chelating agents as additives in advancing high&#8208;performance aluminum batteries.

Additionally, it can participate in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the aluminum surface, evidenced by atom probe topography (APT), effectively protecting the electrode from corrosion. Aqueous aluminum&#8211;organic batteries utilizing this electrolyte containing BMEA demonstrate high specific capacity and stable cycling performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous aluminum-ion batteries have garnered significant attention owing to the abundance of aluminum resources, high theoretical specific capacity, and excellent safety. However, challenges such as electrolyte-induced water decomposition, aluminum anode corrosion, and electrode material compatibility continue to constrain their performance. In this study, we restructured the solvation environment using the chelating reagent Bis(2-methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), achieving an expanded electrochemical window of 2.2&#160;V and mitigating hydrogen evolution side reactions. Advanced atom probe tomography analysis confirmed that BMEA actively participates in the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), effectively preventing aluminum surface corrosion and extending the cycle life of the aluminum anode. Employed as a BMEA-containing electrolyte in aluminum&#8211;organic batteries, the resulting Al||Tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCB) battery delivered a high capacity of 218.0&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrated stable cycling over 300 cycles. This study highlights the potential of chelating agents as additives in advancing high-performance aluminum batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>SPLICEIT Fluorescent Sensor for Integrating Dopamine Release with Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Single&#8208;chain protein&#8208;based ligand indication through a chimerically&#8208;engineered integrator tool&#8221; (SPLICEIT) is a G&#8208;protein coupled receptor&#8208;based sensor design that leaves a permanent fluorescent mark. We show dopamine detection in primary cultured neurons with a fourfold signal increase normalized to an mCherry (mCh) marker. The SPLICEIT design is generalizable and paves the way for further studies into neuromodulator release across the brain.








Abstract
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter essential for motor control, reward processing, and motivation through G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Recent GPCR&#8208;based real&#8208;time sensors allow for optical monitoring of dopamine release in behaving animals. However, there is still a need for high resolution mapping of dopamine release across large mouse brain volume for systemic studies. To fill this need, we have developed a new chimeric GPCR&#8208;based sensor to detect dopamine with a permanent green fluorescent mark through a combination of computational modeling and rational design. This new sensor, named &#8220;Single&#8208;chain Protein&#8208;based Ligand Indication through a Chimerically&#8208;Engineered Integrator Tool&#8221; (SPLICEIT), detects dopamine at cellular&#8208;resolution with high specificity and a fourfold signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. We also developed a version of SPLICEIT whose signal can be normalized for varying sensor expression in cell culture and in vivo. This paves the way for further studies into dopamine release across the brain and enables the possibility of whole&#8208;brain dopamine mapping.

         <title>Synthesis of Porous Carbon&#8208;Based Network Containing Ultranarrow Nonplanar Nanopores on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the ultranarrow periodic nanopores on Au(111) have been achieved. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments. A significant hole doping due to charge transfer from [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network to Au(111) substrate was revealed by experimental and calculated characterizations.








Abstract
Introduction of twisted structures into low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;based nanostructures has important ramifications on their inherent physical behavior. The fabrication of graphene derivatives with nonplanar characteristics remains challenging, especially for extended two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) structures. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the narrowest periodic nanopores and exhibits the highest negative curvature among 2D nonplanar carbon&#8208;based nanostructures synthesized up to date. The success is driven by the dissymmetrical debromination and regioselective coupling reactions of precursor molecules on Au(111) surface, as corroborated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES). We characterize electronic properties of the [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network with the aid of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and demonstrate a significant hole doping induced by interfacial charge transfer between the nonplanar nanoarchitecture and the Au(111) substrate.

         <title>Rationally Designed Asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu Ligand to Stabilize Active Sites Towards Superior Industrial&#8208;Standard Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand located in PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface effectively balance the adsorption and dissociation of reaction intermediates at different active sites, and simultaneously prevent the dissolution or agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. 








Abstract
Developing efficient and durable Pt&#8208;based catalysts via interface engineering remains a critical yet challenging task for water electrolysis under high&#8208;pH conditions. Herein, we design a unique asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand at the PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface to promote alkaline HER kinetics. This ligand balances the adsorption and desorption of H* on the Pt site by accelerating electron transfer at the interface while enhancing the adsorption of H2O on the Cu site. Moreover, the strong d&#8208;d/sp hybridization and more delocalized d&#8208;DOS located at the Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand enhance the interatomic interactions, which helps alleviate the dissolution and agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. As anticipated, the PtCu2/CuO requires ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 10, 14 and 47&#160;mV in, respectively, alkaline, acidic and neutral electrolytes to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Even more surprising is that the PtCu2/CuO||RuO2 dual&#8208;electrode hydrolysis cell can stably operate at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 500&#160;h in a simulated industrial environment, demonstrating significant potential for industrial applications. This work provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based alkaline hydrogen evolution catalytic materials.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Driven In Situ Formation of Bimetallic Catalysts via Sn2+/Sn4+ Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative in situ redox&#8208;driven strategy utilizes Sn2+/Sn4+ ions interconversion for the synthesis of Sn&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts. This approach involves immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina, followed by secondary metal ions capture via redox reactions.








Abstract
Bimetallic catalysts have garnered substantial interest across diverse fields due to their distinctive geometric and electronic structures. Nevertheless, achieving uniformly distributed bimetallic catalysts remains challenging due to the solubility or charge properties of ions in specific bimetallic systems. Herein, we present an innovative in situ redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy utilizing Sn2+/Sn4+ interconversion to address these challenges. By immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina and capturing secondary metal ions through redox reactions, we successfully synthesized eight distinct Sn&#8211;M bimetallic catalysts. The representative Sn&#8211;Pt catalysts derived from [PtCl4]2&#8722; or [Pt(NH3)4]2+ ions, lead to the reduction of Pt2+ to Pt0 with analogous local structures, resulting in comparable catalytic performance in carbon monoxide oxidation and propane dehydrogenation. This redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy can be extended to other bimetallic systems, with promising preliminary results observed in Cr&#8211;M systems. This innovative strategy effectively mitigates the hydrolysis of tin ions, neutralizes the influence of ion charges, and addresses the solubility challenges of secondary metal ions, providing a robust solution for the design of bimetallic catalysts.

         <title>Zwitterionic Heavier Pnictinidenes in Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N-Heterocyclic Carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low-valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast (600 ps) Vacuum&#8208;UV Reflective Scintillation Enabled by Surface Exciton Recombination in Layered Perovskite PEA2PbBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodetection is pivotal for space exploration and radiation monitoring, yet its dynamic imaging capability is significantly hindered by the slow response of conventional scintillators. However, existing scintillators exhibit microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;nanosecond decay time, failing to meet sub&#8208;nanosecond ultrafast imaging demands. Here, we uncovered a surface exciton recombination mechanism in layered perovskite PEA2PbBr4, where lattice contraction induced exciton localization, achieving ultrafast decay time of 600 ps&#8212;over 100&#8208;fold faster than commercial scintillation. A reflective optical configuration was designed to suppress self&#8208;absorption, improving the light utilization efficiency. This work established a material paradigm for ultrafast dynamic imaging and opens avenues for advancing space science and high&#8208;energy physics detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Bonnadiene and ent&#8208;Polytrichastrene B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B, two diterpenoids that share a common spirotricyclic skeleton. Notably, ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B also features a highly strained, sterically congested tetrasubstituted cyclopropane moiety, presenting significant synthetic challenges in both its construction and stereochemical control. The synthesis features: (1) Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective  redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation between electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenyl triflate and primary alkenol to form the stereocenter at C7; (2) diastereoselective intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition to rapidly assemble the unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic skeleton; (3) sequential installation of the requisite alkyl groups and alkenes present in the targeted molecule by leveraging the functionalities positioned on the tricycle; (4) Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;initiated hydrogenation to stereospecifically reduce the tetrasubstituted &#916;10,11 olefin and install the contiguous stereocenters; (5) Fe&#8208;mediated HAT&#8208;initiated 3&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization to rapidly forge the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring with excellent stereoselectivity.</dc:description>
