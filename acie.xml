         <title>An antitumor dual&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest supramolecular polymer based on hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of specific guests which can respond to external stimuli is the main approach for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) based on host&#8208;guest interactions. Most functional guests, however, fail to manifest stimuli&#8208;responses. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;responsive dimeric azocalixarene (D&#8208;SAC4A) with outstanding hosting properties was used as the macrocyclic building block for the preparation of host stimuli&#8208;responsive SPs. Since azocalixarenes can also be compatible with stimuli&#8208;responsive guests, an antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was chosen and linked via a disulfide&#8208;containing linker to afford a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive ditropic guest (D&#8208;CPT). A unique dual&#8208;responsive SP was obtained by 1:1 mixing of D&#8208;SAC4A and D&#8208;CPT in water, which further assembled into SP nanoparticles (DSPNs). DSPNs displayed outstanding stability against dilution and biological interferants, as well as precise CPT&#8208;release under GSH and hypoxia conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the good biosafety and tumor&#8208;suppressive effects of DSPNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Integration of Organic Core/Shell Microwires for Advanced Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation Using Inter&#8208;Facet Edge Rich WO3 Arrays for Photoelectrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation reaction leaves room to be improved in the development of various solar fuel productions in an aqueous solution, because of not only the kinetically sluggish 4&#8208;electron transfer process of oxygen evolution reaction but also the formation of unadded value product, O  2  . In this work, we realize reactive oxygen species (ROS), H  2  O  2  and OH&#8226;, formations by water oxidation with total Faraday efficiencies of more than 90% by using (200)/(002) inter&#8208;facet edge (IFE) rich WO  3  arrays in an electrolyte containing CO  3  2&#8208;  . Theoretical simulation and in&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the IFE favors the adsorption of CO  3  2&#8208;  while reducing the adsorption energy of OH&#8226;, as well as suppresses surface hole accumulation to enable a synergetic direct and indirect charge transfer pathways of 1&#8208;electron and 2&#8208;electron transfer processes. Finally, we present selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in in&#8208;situ using the formed OH&#8226;, which delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of ~768 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  with near 100% selectivity that exceeds the most reported value. This work offers a promising approach to tune or control the oxidation reaction in an aqueous solar fuel system towards high efficiency and value&#8208;added product  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Sensitive and Reversible Labeling Strategy Enables Global Mapping of the Core&#8208;Fucosylated Glycoproteome on Cell Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that locate on cell surfaces can be selectively probed by a reversible labeling strategy, enabling the global mapping of the core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome.







Abstract
Core fucosylation, the attachment of &#945;1,6&#8208;fucose to the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of N&#8208;glycans, has a strong relationship with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and immune evasion by regulating many membrane proteins. However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell&#8208;surface core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell&#8208;surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.

         <title>Combination Cancer Treatment: Using Engineered DNAzyme Molecular Machines for Dynamic Inter&#8208; and Intracellular Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines was designed for promoting cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. Our strategy resulted in an enhanced killing effect, demonstrated using zinc deficient cancer cells, thus providing a promising next&#8208;generation combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
Despite the promise of combination cancer therapy, it remains challenging to develop targeted strategies that are nontoxic to normal cells. Here we report a combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines that can promote cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. To achieve external regulation of T&#8208;cell/cancer cell interactions, we designed a DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with an aptamer and an i&#8208;motif, as the MUC&#8208;1&#8208;selective aptamer allows the specific recognition of cancer cells. The i&#8208;motif is folded under the tumor acidic microenvironment, shortening the intercellular distance. As a result, T&#8208;cells are released by metal ion activated DNAzyme cleavage. To achieve internal regulation of mitochondria, we delivered another DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with mitochondria&#8208;targeted peptides into cancer cells to induce mitochondria aggregation. Our strategy achieved an enhanced killing effect in zinc deficient cancer cells.

         <title>Deracemization through Sequential Photoredox&#8208;Neutral and Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stoichiometric reagent&#8208;free deracemization strategy based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis is developed. The strategy offers precise access to biologically important &#945;&#8208;amino esters and variants with high yields and ee values. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by enantiocontrol of the protonation as the stereocentre&#8208;forming step. The method is also viable for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino esters.







Abstract
Catalytic deracemization is an ideal synthetic strategy due to its formally perfect atom utilization. Asymmetric photocatalysis has been appreciated as a promising tool to accomplish this attractive reaction pattern in an economical fashion, but it remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a new platform based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis, allowing efficient and modular optical enrichment of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and other valuable analogues. Two single&#8208;electron transfer processes between the photocatalyst and the substrates serve to provide the key prochiral intermediates, and the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst mediates enantioselective protonation to reconstitute a stereogenic C&#8722;H bond. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by the enantiofacial differentiation effect during the stereocentre&#8208;forming step.

The strategy offers precise access to biologically important &#945;-amino esters and variants with high yields and &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; values. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by enantiocontrol of the protonation as the stereocentre-forming step. The method is also viable for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;-deuterated &#945;-amino esters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic deracemization is an ideal synthetic strategy due to its formally perfect atom utilization. Asymmetric photocatalysis has been appreciated as a promising tool to accomplish this attractive reaction pattern in an economical fashion, but it remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a new platform based on photoredox-neutral catalysis, allowing efficient and modular optical enrichment of &#945;-amino esters and other valuable analogues. Two single-electron transfer processes between the photocatalyst and the substrates serve to provide the key prochiral intermediates, and the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst mediates enantioselective protonation to reconstitute a stereogenic C&#8722;H bond. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by the enantiofacial differentiation effect during the stereocentre-forming step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Triplet Label Extends Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy from Pico&#8208; to Microseconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short vibrational lifetimes limit monitoring molecular dynamics by conventional IR spectroscopy to &#8776;15&#8197;ps. We extend this window &#8776;50&#8201;000 fold by introducing the novel Fourier&#8208;transform VIPER pulse sequence with the triplet label 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone. Slow processes up to 1&#8197;&#956;s (e.g., in glassy matrices, liquid crystals, or solvent dynamics) are now accessible.







Abstract
In conventional two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, the inherently short vibrational lifetimes limit the time window to observe molecular dynamics typically to tens of picoseconds. The rather complex dynamics of organized molecular systems (e.g., glass formers, polymers, membranes, proteins), however, span a wide range of timescales from femto&#8208; to microseconds and beyond. Vibrationally Promoted Electronic Resonance (VIPER) 2D&#8208;IR negates the limitations of 2D&#8208;IR spectroscopy, for its signal decays with the electronic lifetime. Here, we present 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone as the first VIPER 2D&#8208;IR probe to exploit intersystem crossing, thereby covering even the microsecond timescale. We achieved the required signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and resolution by introducing the Fourier&#8208;transform approach to the VIPER 2D&#8208;IR pulse sequence. Now, we are in a position to monitor dynamics via spectral diffusion several orders of magnitude beyond the vibrational lifetime of 2D&#8208;IR labels.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Simple Ketones Enabled by Activation of Unstrained C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;free formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction was established between simple ketones and arylboronates based on activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds. The key to the success of this reaction is a nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.







Abstract
The use of ketones as electrophiles to couple with arylboronic acid derivatives via C&#8722;C bond activation has become a significant progress in the area of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction, in which a permanent or temporary directing group is often required to promote the activation of the unstrained C&#8722;C bond via oxidative addition. Herein, we disclosed the first example of directing group free formal SMC reaction of simple ketones with arylboronates via Rh&#8208;catalyzed unstrained C&#8722;C bond activation. A wide range of simple ketones, including aryl alkyl ketones, diaryl ketones and aryl perfluoroalkyl ketones, can serve as electrophiles to participate in the SMC reaction with aryl or perfluoroalkyl as the leaving group. The key to the success of this reaction is by means of nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Modulated Nucleofugality of SeIII Species to Enable Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Semipinacol Manifolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox catalytic 1,2&#8208;carbon&#8208;shift manifold is enabled by an unprecedented OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;SeIII hydrogen bond co&#8208;activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds. While traditional oxidative methods for the activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds proceed through SeIV intermediates and commonly result in rapid elimination of the SeIV residue, this protocol facilitates, for the first time, the stereospecific substitution of SeIII nucleofuges by carbon nucleophiles.







Abstract
Chemical bond activations mediated by H&#8208;bond interactions involving highly electronegative elements such as nitrogen and oxygen are powerful tactics in modern catalysis research. On the contrary, kindred catalytic regimes in which heavier, less electronegative elements such as selenium engage in H&#8208;bond interactions to co&#8208;activate C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds under oxidative conditions are elusive. Traditional strategies to enhance the nucleofugality of selenium residues predicate on the oxidative addition of electrophiles onto SeII&#8208;centers, which entails the elimination of the resulting SeIV moieties. Catalytic procedures in which SeIV nucleofuges are substituted rather than eliminated are very rare and, so far, not applicable to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations. In this study, we introduce an unprecedented combination of O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se H&#8208;bond interactions and single electron oxidation to catalytically generate SeIII nucleofuges that allow for the formation of new C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds by means of a type I semipinacol process in high yields and excellent selectivity.

         <title>Glycan Modulation of Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor&#8208;1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work provides a new insight into insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R), which is preferentially inhibited by smaller heparan sulfate chains, e.g., HS06, in contrast to longer polysaccharidic chains, e.g., HS36, which are devoid of the inhibition function.







Abstract
The insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays critical roles in cancer. Microarray, computational, thermodynamic, and cellular imaging studies reveal that activation of IGF&#8208;1R by its cognate ligand IGF1 is inhibited by shorter, soluble heparan sulfate (HS) sequences (e.g., HS06), whereas longer polymeric chains do not inhibit the RTK, a phenomenon directly opposed to the traditional relationship known for GAG&#8208;protein systems. The inhibition arises from smaller oligosaccharides binding in a unique pocket in the IGF&#8208;1R ectodomain, which competes with the natural cognate ligand IGF1. This work presents a highly interesting observation on preferential and competing inhibition of IGF&#8208;1R by smaller sequences, whereas polysaccharides are devoid of this function. These insights will be of major value to glycobiologists and anti&#8208;cancer drug discoverers.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Quinoids by Organocatalytic Tandem N&#8208;Arylation/Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed process was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;aryl quinoid atropisomers through direct C&#8722;N bond formation. In this way, a broad range of functionalized N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers containing an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring were constructed in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Diarylamines and related scaffolds are ubiquitous atropisomeric chemotypes in biologically active natural products. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these axially chiral compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report that a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) successfully catalyzed the atroposelective coupling of quinone esters and anilines through direct C&#8722;N bond formation to afford N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers with an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring in good yields and enantioselectivities with the quinone ester as both the electrophile and the oxidant. A gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the utility of this synthetic protocol. Moreover, this methodology provides a platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse secondary amine atropisomers by nucleophilic addition.

&lt;p&gt;A chiral-phosphoric-acid-catalyzed process was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl quinoid atropisomers through direct C&#8722;N bond formation. In this way, a broad range of functionalized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl quinone atropisomers containing an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six-membered ring were constructed in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diarylamines and related scaffolds are ubiquitous atropisomeric chemotypes in biologically active natural products. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these axially chiral compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report that a BINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) successfully catalyzed the atroposelective coupling of quinone esters and anilines through direct C&#8722;N bond formation to afford N-aryl quinone atropisomers with an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six-membered ring in good yields and enantioselectivities with the quinone ester as both the electrophile and the oxidant. A gram-scale experiment demonstrated the utility of this synthetic protocol. Moreover, this methodology provides a platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse secondary amine atropisomers by nucleophilic addition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microhydrated 3&#8208;Methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol: Evolution of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network from Chains to Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase MOM&#8208;(H2O)n (n=0&#8211;6) clusters are studied using rotational spectroscopy. The growth of the H&#8208;bonding networks in these complexes exhibits characteristic transitions from one&#8208;dimensional chains, to two&#8208;dimensional rings, and further to three&#8208;dimensional arrangements that leads to a &#8220;cube&#8221;&#8208;like network resembling the pure water octamer.







Abstract
Broadband rotational spectroscopy is used to investigate the geometries of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol and its complexes with up to six water molecules, which are produced in supersonic jets. The main low&#8208;energy isomers of these clusters are unambiguously identified in the spectra with the support of quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The conformation of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol geometry is found to be influenced by the microsolvation effects. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrangements in the hydrate complexes, which are governed by the water&#8208;water and water&#8208;solute interactions, exhibit characteristic configurations with increasing number of water molecules and resemble the main isomers of the corresponding pure water clusters. Evolution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding structures from one&#8208;dimensional chains to two&#8208;dimensional rings and further to multicyclic three&#8208;dimensional networks is observed, which provides information about the build&#8208;up process.

         <title>General Access to N&#8722;CF3 Secondary Amines and Their Transformation to N&#8722;CF3 Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and mild method for the generation of HF from triethylsilane and silver fluoride leads to a highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines. Novel N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides were constructed from these promising amine building blocks and sulfonyl bromides in an unprecedented route.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds through fluorination or trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;containing compounds has been extensively investigated. However, general access to N&#8722;CF3 compounds simply from N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines is hampered by the challenging preparation and instability of these amines, as well as a much lower reactivity due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl moiety. Herein, we report a general and highly efficient synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines with excellent isolated yields via the addition of the in situ generated difluoromethyl imine (R&#8722;N=CF2) intermediates with hydrogen fluoride, which is mildly produced by triethylsilane and silver fluoride. N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides, highly desirable but scarce at present, are easily accessible from these valuable building blocks through an unprecedented route. This study will bring new vitality to the synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds.

         <title>A Dislocated Twin&#8208;Locking Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Configuration for Efficient Delayed Fluorescence with Multiple Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locking a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) by two spriofluorene groups has led to a rigid dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) configuration that exhibits multiple through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). This emitter shows both efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
Organic materials featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states are advantageous for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), although the realization of multiple TSCT systems remains challenging. Herein, a rigid molecule with a three&#8208;dimensional dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor configuration has been developed by a linking biphenazine (2PXZ) donor and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor through the twin&#8208;locking of two spiro&#8208;fluorene bridges. The twin&#8208;locking construction with multiple TSCT effects suppresses the intramolecular rotations of various segments in 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ, leading to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference, a fast reverse intersystem crossing process, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This material simultaneously possesses the capabilities of TADF and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The device employing 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ as a dopant displays an optimal external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;% and a low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <dc:description>
Novel metal&#8208;organic framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is the first MOF that can not only extract gold from artificial electronic waste, but then be converted into an effective catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. It offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Expensive gold&#8208;based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO2 reduction into CO. A feasible approach to obtain low&#8208;cost Au&#8208;based catalysts is needed. Herein, a novel framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is prepared. It exhibits a high BET surface area of 1569&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high solvents/pH stability. 1 can not only selectively extract AuCl4&#8722; from artificial electronic waste, but can then be transformed into low&#8208;cost catalyst Au nanoparticle@1&#8208;x (Au NPs@1&#8208;x, x=1, 2, 3, 4) with tuneable Au NPs sizes. The CO2RR investigations revealed that the Au NPs@1&#8208;3 displayed an excellent FECO of 95.2&#8201;% with a current density of 102.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and such high catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 15&#8197;h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages prevents Au NPs agglomeration. This work offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts for various reactions activated by Au.

         <title>Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages (PCCs) are known for their strong intermolecular interaction and high stability for homogeneous catalysis. In this work, a photo&#8208;active molecule, PTH, was assembled into PCC&#8208;40, which showed excellent photocatalytic performance in dehalogenation and photo&#8208;borylation. The synergistic effect of multi catalytic centers was studied. The results may provide future directions for improvement of a large group of photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;catalysis by small&#8208;molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron&#8208;transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;phenothiazine (PTH)&#8208;derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single&#8208;electron transfer, was utilized for photo&#8208;catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage. This discovery provides a potential strategy to improve the photophysical properties and stabilities of small&#8208;molecule organic photocatalysts via supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>&#928;&#8211;&#928; Stacking Complex Induces Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions To Synthesize Functionalized Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction for the reductive generation of synthetically important &#945;&#8208;amino radicals proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complex. Multiple &#960; interactions stabilize the reactive intermediate, and neither a photocatalyst nor an initiator are required. This synthetic pathway enabled the synthesis of complex functionalized amines in high yield.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and ion&#8208;pairing interactions induced the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals under the irradiation of visible light without the requirement of an expensive photocatalyst. This strategy enabled the construction of functionalized amines via three&#8208;component coupling reactions with broad scope (we report &gt;50 examples with an up to 90&#8201;% yield). This synthetic pathway also delivered complex functionalized amines with a very high yield. Quantum chemistry Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations identified &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complexes; time&#8208;dependent DFT was employed to simulate the absorption spectra, and nudged elastic band (NEB) methodology provided a possible interaction/reaction picture of the selected species.

Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co layered double oxide yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) are designed as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a two&#8208;step conversion strategy. Owing to the enhanced mass transport of the structure and the modulated chemical environment of metal species, the obtained NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER with good stability.







Abstract
The exploration of earth&#8208;abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self&#8208;engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk&#8208;shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal&#8211;organic framework, Co&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) yolk&#8208;shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF&#8208;67 building blocks are transformed into Ni&#8208;Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co LDH yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) through an ion&#8208;exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Wittig reaction is demonstrated as novel synthetic strategy for the synthesis of crystalline unsubstituted vinylene&#8208;linked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks through the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity. Ultrafast THz spectroscopy discloses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art charge&#8208;transport properties of as&#8208;prepared V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs as a result of electron delocalization in the fully conjugated frameworks.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the E/Z selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs2CO3) to obtain more stable intermediates and elevating the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap as a Critical Molecular Descriptor for Predicting Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) is proposed as a critical molecular descriptor to predict organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiency. An unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning when combining with two conventional descriptors, optical gap (Eg) and driving force (&#916;EDA), enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of efficient OPV materials.







Abstract
In contrast to the inorganic and perovskite solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPV) depend on a series of charge generation and recombination processes, which complicates molecular design to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we first propose the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) as a critical molecular descriptor for predicting the PCE considering that minimizing &#916;EST is beneficial to simultaneously reduce voltage loss and triplet recombination. Remarkably, the results from data&#8208;driven machine learning verify that the prediction accuracy of the &#916;EST (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.72) is apparently superior to that of two commonly used molecular descriptors in OPV, i.e., the optical gap (r=0.65) and the driving force (r=0.53). Moreover, an impressive prediction accuracy of r=0.81 is achieved just by combining the three descriptors. This work paves the way toward rapid and precise screening of efficient OPV materials.

Moreover, an impressive prediction accuracy of &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=0.81 is achieved just by combining the three descriptors. This work paves the way toward rapid and precise screening of efficient OPV materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substrate Induced Movement of the Metal Cofactor between Active and Resting State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It requires a substrate to be active. Pyruvate dependent Class II aldolases require a ketoacid to induce a metal shift from resting state to active enzyme. This occurs without alterations in the protein structure and might be a common, but to date overlooked, feature in many metalloproteins.







Abstract
Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far&#8208;reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor's properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (SwHKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M2+R), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M2+A) at 2.4&#8197;&#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M2+A affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M2+R to M2+A. While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.

         <title>A Cation Concentration Gradient Approach to Tune the Selectivity and Activity of CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation concentration gradient approach is developed to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction on three archetypical catalysts. This approach provides a new strategy to break the linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different catalytic intermediates via cation induced dipole&#8208;field interactions.







Abstract
The linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different intermediates limits the catalyst performance in CO2 electroreduction. Here we demonstrate a cation concentration gradient strategy to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction, thereby breaking the scaling relationship. In optimal concentrations of the potassium acetate (KAc) electrolyte, Cu, Ag and In catalysts deliver current densities that are 7.1, 3.2, 2.7&#8197;times higher than those obtained in 0.5&#8197;M KAc for C2H4, CO, and formate production, respectively. Increasing the concentration of KAc also changes the selectivity from CO to formate on Ag, and from CO to C2 products on Cu. In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy and computational simulations reveal that the binding energies of intermediates are changed at different electrolyte concentrations, which is due to a local electrostatic interaction modulated by potassium cations at the electrode surface.

         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;treatment strategy for achieving high photoluminescence performance in a green&#8208;emitting Tb&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework is reported by Xinyi Yang, Qianrong Fang, Banglin Chen, Bo Zou and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210836). The enhanced hydrogen bonds lock the conjugated configuration, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer. This pressure&#8208;treated MOF exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescence quantum yield of 90.4&#8201;% by comparison with the initial value of 50.6&#8201;%.

         <title>Chromium/Photoredox Dual Catalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Benzylic Alcohols, Isochromanones, 1,2&#8208;Oxy Alcohols and 1,2&#8208;Thio Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;benzylic alcohols, functionalized isochromanones, 1,2&#8208;oxy alcohols and 1,2&#8208;thio alcohols has been successfully achieved by employing a dual catalytic method combining chromium chemistry and photoredox catalysis. This presents a methodology under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, a Cr/Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed general synthetic strategy to access &#945;&#8208;benzylic alcohols, isochromanones, oxy alcohols and thio alcohols is unveiled. Alkylation of aldehydes being a crucial C&#8722;C bond forming reaction, designing competent catalytic systems would render an attractive and decorated set of diverse alcohol motifs. Considering the challenges associated with classical organometallic chemistry, the strategy of dual catalysis is applied here to generate diverse alcohol motifs in a mild and efficient manner. The amalgamation of photocatalysis with chromium chemistry is chosen for this purpose to generate an environment with low basicity and thus, high chemoselectivity. With alkyl silanes as preferred coupling partners, this catalytic setup produces a broad substrate scope with an excellent functional group tolerance and displays a facile scale&#8208;up as well. Its application towards biologically relevant molecules and product diversification contributes to the synthetic utility of this method.

         <title>Helical Molecular Springs with Varying Spring Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minature versions of Hookean springs can be built from single&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers. The spring constants of these molecular springs vary with the helix diameter analogous to classical springs. These new molecular springs provide an alternative mechanism of expansion/contraction controlled by the intrinsic helical geometries of the ladder polymers, which do not unfold under tension unlike more common flexible polymers.







Abstract
We report a general synthetic route toward helical ladder polymers with varying spring constants, built with chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape&#8208;persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs. Our synthesis is adaptable to helices with different pitch and diameter, which allowed us to investigate how molecular flexibility in solution depends on the exact geometry of the ladder polymers. Specifically, we showed with molecular dynamic simulations and by measuring the longitudinal 1H NMR relaxation times (T1) for our polymers at different Larmor frequencies, that increasing the helix diameter leads to increased flexibility. Our results present initial design rules for tuning the mechanical properties of intrinsically helical ladder polymers in solution, which will help inspire a new class of robust, spring&#8208;like molecular materials with varying mechanical properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency CO2/N2 Separation Enabled by Rotation of Electrostatically Anchored Flexible Ligands in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible rotation of ligand in metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) can be anchored by electrostatic negative molecules (e.g., CF3COO&#8722;). Rotation of electrostatically anchored flexible ligands opens four&#8208;membered (4&#8208;M) windows enables precise CO2/N2 separation.







Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are of great potential for molecular separation, but the ligand rotation flexibility makes them remain challenging in the construction of fixed nanochannels for precise sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;anchoring strategy to fix the rotation of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM) ligand in ZIF&#8208;8. Electrostatic inducer trifluoroacetate anchored at and blocked the six&#8208;membered windows of ZIF&#8208;8, and meanwhile induced the positive 2&#8208;MIM rotated from initial 49&#176; to 68&#176;, thus opening neighbored four&#8208;membered windows with a constant size of 3.4&#8197;&#197;. The obtained ZIF&#8208;8 significantly enhanced the CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity from 14.02 to 332.86. Further membrane&#8208;based separation exhibited an outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of up to 137 with a desired permeability of 286 Barrer, which exceeded the 2019 upper bound. This strategy provides a new inspiration for fixing the ligand rotation in soft MOF for desired precise molecular sieving.

         <title>Crownphyrins: Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of the Porphyrin&#8208;Crown Ether Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crownphyrins&#8212;hybrid systems forged from porphyrin and crown ethers counterparts, were synthesized. The novel family of macrocycles serves as dynamic, conformationally flexible systems, able to undergo guest&#8208;induced, reversible expansion. A tunable character of their cavities allows for binding neutral and ionic guests.







Abstract
Crownphyrins are hybrid macrocycles combining structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral, and ionic guests. The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal&#8208;mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible. The reaction of the figure&#8208;eight mercury(II) assembly with [2.2.2]cryptand results in ring contraction providing the metal&#8208;free crownphyrin macrocycle.

         <title>Sequential and Reversible Phase Transformations in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Sb&#8208;based Halides towards Multiple Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the sequential and reversible phase transformation and photoluminescence switching of orange (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#8901;H2O crystal, red (MTP)2SbBr5 crystal and (MTP)2SbBr5 glass with near&#8208;infrared emission. Utilizing their nature of luminescence switching accompanying with reversible phase transformations, we achieved the multiple and repeatable anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides have drawn increasing attention due to the attractive structure dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Here, we report two new 0D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Sb&#8208;based halides, (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#8901;H2O (MTP=Methyltriphenylphosphonium, crystal&#8197;1) and (MTP)2SbBr5 (crystal&#8197;2), featuring a reversible structural phase transformation and tunable orange and red emissions upon dehydration and rehydration of H2O molecules. Intriguingly, a subsequent heat treatment further enables the formation of glassy state (MTP)2SbBr5 (glass&#8197;3) with near&#8208;infrared luminescence, moreover, a sequential reverse phase transformation from glass&#8197;3 to crystal&#8197;2 and 1 is triggered by acetonitrile and water vapor stepwise. The anti&#8208;counterfeiting demo based on the tunable and reversible PL switching is finally achieved and thus the phase structure engineering in 0D metal halides expands their multiple applications in optical fields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed divergent arylation of alkenyl thianthrenium salts with arylboroxines which allows switchable synthesis of both terminal and internal alkene products in a highly selective manner is reported. The use of a diene ligand guides the reaction toward cine&#8208;arylation affording terminal alkenes, while the use of a phosphine ligand switches the reaction to ipso&#8208;arylation exclusively giving internal alkenes.

         <title>Advancing Critical Chemical Processes for a Sustainable Future: Challenges for Industry and the Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article presents some of the research activities and visions of the newly established Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT). Heterogeneous catalysis faces a number of challenges before a sustainable future may be achieved. Key concerns of FUNCAT are industrially relevant processes, such as green hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, and acetylene chemistry.







Abstract
Catalysis is involved in around 85&#8201;% of manufacturing industry and contributes an estimated 25&#8201;% to the global domestic product, with the majority of the processes relying on heterogeneous catalysis. Despite the importance in different global segments, the fundamental understanding of heterogeneously catalysed processes lags substantially behind that achieved in other fields. The newly established Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT) targets innovative concepts that could contribute to the scientific developments needed in the research field to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industries. This Viewpoint Article presents some of our research activities and visions on the current and future challenges of heterogeneous catalysis regarding green industry and the circular economy by focusing explicitly on critical processes. Namely, hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, and carbon dioxide reduction, along with new aspects of acetylene chemistry.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acids: A Multifunctional Monooxygenase Delivers a Complex and Highly Branched Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nodulisporic acids are structurally complex potent antiinsectan natural products produced by the filamentous fungus Hypoxylon pulicicidum. A gene cluster, consisting of 13 genes, has been identified and biosynthetic machinery functionally characterised. This work reveals a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple nodulisporic acid congeners. The variation arises due to the action of a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ.







Abstract
Nodulisporic acids (NAs) are structurally complex potent antiinsectan indole diterpenes. We previously reported the biosynthetic gene cluster for these metabolites in Hypoxylon pulicicidum and functionally characterised the first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Here we reveal a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple end products through expression of cluster components in Penicillium paxilli. We show that seven additional cluster&#8208;encoded gene products comprise the biosynthetic machinery that elaborate precursor NAF in this highly branched pathway. The combined action of these enzymes delivers 37 NA congeners including four major end products, NAA, NAA1, NAA2 and NAA4. The plethora of intermediates arises due to modification of the carboxylated prenyl tail by a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme which produces four distinct biosynthetic products giving rise to the complex metabolic grid that characterises NA biosynthesis.

     alt="Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acids: A Multifunctional Monooxygenase Delivers a Complex and Highly Branched Array"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodulisporic acids are structurally complex potent antiinsectan natural products produced by the filamentous fungus &lt;i&gt;Hypoxylon pulicicidum&lt;/i&gt;. A gene cluster, consisting of 13 genes, has been identified and biosynthetic machinery functionally characterised. This work reveals a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple nodulisporic acid congeners. The variation arises due to the action of a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodulisporic acids (NAs) are structurally complex potent antiinsectan indole diterpenes. We previously reported the biosynthetic gene cluster for these metabolites in &lt;i&gt;Hypoxylon pulicicidum&lt;/i&gt; and functionally characterised the first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Here we reveal a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple end products through expression of cluster components in &lt;i&gt;Penicillium paxilli&lt;/i&gt;. We show that seven additional cluster-encoded gene products comprise the biosynthetic machinery that elaborate precursor NAF in this highly branched pathway. The combined action of these enzymes delivers 37 NA congeners including four major end products, NAA, NAA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, NAA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NAA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The plethora of intermediates arises due to modification of the carboxylated prenyl tail by a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme which produces four distinct biosynthetic products giving rise to the complex metabolic grid that characterises NA biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interactions in Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diatomic catalysts have attracted much attention, especially in electrochemistry. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews on long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs) between metallic centres. This Minireview introduces the key aspects of LRIs and highlights opportunities for regulating electrocatalytic mechanisms, thus presenting guidelines for the targeted usage of LRIs.







Abstract
The simultaneous presence of two active metal centres in diatomic catalysts (DACs) leads to the occurrence of specific interactions between active sites. Such interactions, referred to as long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs), play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of a reaction. The optimal combination of metal centres must be determined to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, LRIs have not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of LRIs are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRIs in DACs are proposed in order to present an overall view and reference for future research.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of phosphino(imino)pyridine (PIP) molybdenum cyclooctadiene (COD) complexes [(PIP)Mo(COD)] with dihydrogen in the presence of benzene selectively furnished the molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum&#8211;hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while para&#8208;xylene instead predominantly formed the molybdenum &#951;6&#8208;arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane&#8208;d12 solution of [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report the first total synthesis of the&#160;Streptococcus&#160;pneumoniae&#160;serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharide, a unique zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide carrying labile&#160;O&#8208;acetyl esters. The target oligosaccharides, featuring the rare&#160;a&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy galactose (AAT) and&#160;a&#8208;galacturonic acids, were assembled up to the 9&#8208;mer level, in a highly stereoselective manner using trisaccharide building blocks.&#160;The lability of the&#160;O&#8208;acetyl esters imposed a careful deprotection scheme to prevent migration and hydrolysis. The migration was investigated in detail at various pD values using NMR spectroscopy, to show that migration and hydrolysis of the C&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl esters readily takes place under neutral conditions. Structural investigation showed the oligomers to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure with the acetyl esters exposed on the periphery of the helix in close proximity of the neighboring AAT residues, thereby imposing conformational restrictions on the AAT&#945;1&#8722;4GalA(3OAc) glycosidic linkages, supporting the helical shape of the polysaccharide, that has been proposed to be critical for its unique biological activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their widespread properties, nitridophosphates are of high interest in current research. Explorative high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature investigations yielded various compounds with stoichiometry MP2N4 (M = Be, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cd), which are discussed as ultra&#8208;hard or luminescent materials, when doped with Eu2+. Herein, we report the first germanium nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, synthesized from Ge3N4 and P3N5 at 6&#160;GPa and 800&#160;&#176;C. The structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, IR and NMR spectroscopy. The highly condensed network of PN4&#8208;tetrahedra shows a strong structural divergence to other MP2N4 compounds, which is attributed to the stereochemical influence of the lone pair of Ge2+. Thus, the formal exchange of alkaline earth cations with Ge2+ may open access to various compounds with literature&#8208;known stoichiometry, however, new structures and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Electroluminescent Elastomers with Self&#8208;Confinement Effect for Highly Efficient Non&#8208;Blended Stretchable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are emerging as a basic component of flexible electronics and human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the brightness and efficiency of stretchable OLEDs remain still far inferior to their rigid counterparts, owing to the scarcity of satisfactory stretchable electroluminescent materials. Herein, we explore a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect to dramatically improve the stretchability of elastomers, without affecting electroluminescent properties. The balanced rigid/flexible chain dynamics under self&#8208;confinement significantly reduces the modulus of the elastomers, resulting in the maximum strain reaching 806%. Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs, achieving unprecedented high&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs. The results suggest an effective molecular design strategy for highly deformable stretchable displays and flexible electronics.</dc:description>

The results suggest an effective molecular design strategy for highly deformable stretchable displays and flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Dihydrogen Activation and Catalytic H/D Exchange with Group 10 Heterometallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex featuring a [PdMg3H3] core with H2  is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species alongside an equivalent of a magnesium hydride co&#8208;product [MgH]. While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg2H4], analogous [PtMg2H4] and [PtZn2H4] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni&#8208;Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal&#8211;metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Decarboxylative Protonation Enabled by Cooperative Earth&#8208;Abundant Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative protonation is a general deletion tactic to replace polar carboxylic acid groups with hydrogen or its isotope. Current methods rely on the pre&#8208;activation of acids, non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen sources, and/or expensive/highly oxidizing photocatalysts, presenting challenges to their wide adoption. Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d&#8208;incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE = 1) are consistent with a light&#8208;limited reaction.</dc:description>

Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the strips formed by the &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1 and 2 exhibited a M&#246;bius topology in the solid state. While the M&#246;bius topology in the parent 1 and 2 in a solution was lost due to the free rotation of the paraphenylene unit even at low temperatures, ene&#8208;[6]CPP 4 with eight 1&#8208;pyrrolyl groups preserved the M&#246;bius topology even in a solution. Despite a twist, 1 has in&#8208;plane conjugation and possesses a unique size dependence of the electronic properties; i.e., the opposite size dependency of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy relative to conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Polycyclic Molecules via Ring Fusion for n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The primary challenge for n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is to improve their electron mobilities and thus the key figure of merit  &#956;C  *. Nevertheless, few reports in OECTs have specially proposed to address this issue. Herein, we report a 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system consisting of the core of naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin dimer and the terminal moieties of rhodamine, which features intramolecular noncovalent interactions, high &#960;&#8208;delocalization and strong electron&#8208;deficient characteristics. We find that this extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using the ring fusion strategy displays improved electron mobilities up to 0.043 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  compared to our previously reported small molecule gNR, and thereby leads to a remarkable  &#956;C  * of 10.3 F cm  &#8722;1  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  in n&#8208;type OECTs, which is the highest value reported to date for small&#8208;molecule OECTs. This work highlights the importance of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension in polycyclic&#8208;fused molecules for enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OECTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Iron(II) Oxide Sites Directly Responsible for Preferential Carbon Monoxide Oxidation at Ambient Temperature: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe2+ species in the working state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;FeOx catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady&#8208;state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe2+ sites. The active Fe2+ species are presumably Fe+2O&#8208;2 clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe3+) and metallic iron (Fe0) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe2+ is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Electroformation of Gold Nanoparticles in Nanoliter Droplet Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing, and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are formed on a microfluidic device and exposed to an electrical current by guiding them through a pair of parallel electrodes. We exploit the naturally occurring recirculation flows inside confined droplets (moving in rectangular microchannels) to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles after nucleation. Therefore, AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100 nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. The average particle size is defined by the precursor concentration and droplet velocity, while the charge dose given by the electric field strength has a minor effect. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles, and we believe it is a versatile method for the formation of other metal nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Strategy for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfoglycolipids from&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;To Elucidate the Structure and Immunomodulatory Property Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a versatile asymmetric strategy to synthesize different classes of sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) from  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  , namely SL&#8208;I (  1  ), SL&#8208;II (  2  ), SL&#8208;III (  3  ), SL&#8208;IVs (  4  ), (  5  ), and monoacyl Ac  1  SGL (  6  ). The strategy featured the use of asymmetrically&#8208;protected trehaloses, which were acquired from glycosylation of TMS  &#945;  &#8208;glucosyl acceptors with benzylidene protected thioglucosyl donors. The positions of the protecting groups at the donors and acceptors can be fine&#8208;tuned to obtain different protecting group patterns, which are crucial for regioselective acylation and sulfation. In addition, a chemoenzymatic strategy was established to prepare the polymethylated fatty acid building blocks. The strategy employs (i) inexpensive lipase as a desymmetrization agent in preparation of starting substrate and (ii) readily&#8208;available chiral oxazolidinone as a chiral&#8208;controlling agent in construction of the polymethylated fatty acids. Subsequent investigation on immunomodulatory property of each class of SGLs showed how the structures of SGLs impact the host innate immunity response.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Defined Water&#8208;Soluble Metallofullerene Derivatives towards Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) are excellent carriers of rare&#8208;earth element (REE) ions in biomedical applications because they preclude the release of toxic metal ions. However, existing approaches to synthesize water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives yield mixtures that inhibit precise drug design. Here we report the synthesis of metallobuckytrio (MBT), a three&#8208;buckyball system, as a modular platform to develop structurally defined water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives with ligands by choice. Demonstrated with PEG ligands, the resulting water&#8208;soluble MBTs show superb biocompatibility. The Gd MBTs exhibit superior T1 relaxivity than typical Gd complexes, potentially superseding current clinical MRI contrast agents in both safety and efficiency. The Lu MBTs generated reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation, showing promise as photosensitizers. With their modular nature to incorporate other ligands, we anticipate the MBT platform to open new paths towards bio&#8208;specific REE drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Interparticle Charge&#8208;Transport&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Quantum&#8208;Dot Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) represents a widely explored technique to generate light, in which the emission intensity relies critically on the charge&#8208;transfer reactions between electrogenerated radicals. Two types of charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms have been postulated for ECL generation, but the manipulation and effective probing of these routes remain a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the design of quantum dot (QD) aerogels as novel ECL luminophores via a versatile water&#8208;induced gelation strategy. The strong electronic coupling between adjacent QDs enables efficient charge transport within the aerogel network, leading to the generation of highly efficient ECL based on the selectively improved interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route. This mechanism is further verified by designing CdSe&#8208;CdTe mixed QD aerogels, where the two mechanistic routes are clearly decoupled for ECL generation. We anticipate our work will advance the fundamental understanding of ECL and prove useful for designing next&#8208;generation QD&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed herein is RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes, which provides a highly efficient and streamlined approach to chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes from readily available starting materials. Introducing O, S, and Se into the anthanthrene skeleton leads to gradually increased &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distances but significantly enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlaps with the growth of heteroatomic radius. Moderate &#960;&#8208;&#960; distance, overlap area, and intermolecular S&#8208;S interactions endow S&#8208;embedded anthanthrene (PTT) with excellent 2D charge&#8208;transport properties. Moreover, the transformation of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type S&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes is realized for the first time via the S&#8208;atom oxidation from PTT to PTT&#8208;O4. In organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices, PTT derivatives exhibit hole transport properties with mobilities up to 1.1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, while PTT&#8208;O4 shows an electron transport property with a mobility of 0.022 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels behave as potential candidates to investigate circularly polarized light (CP)&#8208;matter interaction, which however suffer from small sensitivity towards circular polarization. Here we report a general protocol to build hydrogels from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids with coassembled charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes, covering a wide scope of donors and acceptors, which were incorporated into stable hydrogel matrices. CT complexes formed block coassemblies with gelators, induced the emergence of macroscopic chiral helices, where efficient chirality transfer occurs to realize tunable Cotton effects from visible light to NIR&#8208;I region depending on the structures of CT pairs. The hybrid hydrogels showed tunable photothermal performances with excellent heating&#8208;cooling cycling durability. Circularly polarized NIR light selectively triggered gel&#8208;solution phase transition at different timescales. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;CP illumination generates up to 2.5 folds difference in gel collapse time that allows for direct discrimination by naked eyes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an asymmetric Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction of a&#8208;ketoesters. In the presence of a catalytic amount of simple alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, reaction of tryptamines with methyl 2&#8208;oxoalkanoates affords the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and enantiomeric excesses. A primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE = 4.5) using C2&#8208;deteurium labelled tryptamine indicates that rearomatization via deprotonation of the pentahydro&#8208;b&#8208;carbolinium ion could be the rate and enantioselectivity determining step. A concise enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstratine A, a hexacyclic cagelike monoterpene indole alkaloid, featuring this reaction as a key step, is subsequently accomplished. Re&#8208;measurement of the natural product&#8217;s [&#945;]D indicates that natural alstratine A is dextrorotatory rather than levorotatory as it is initially reported in the isolation paper.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein the first examples of chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;trifluoroacetamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes 1 and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds 2 . The polysubstituted 1&#8208;acetamido cyclohexenes 3 are formed in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise process as shown by deuterium labelling experiment. A catalytic enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of 1 ,  2 and orthohydroxybenzhydryl alcohols 4 is subsequently developed furnishing densely functionalized hexahydroxanthenes 5 in a highly stereoselective manner. This multicomponent reaction generates four chemical bonds with concurrent creation of five contiguous stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Cocrystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous frameworks composed of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed multicomponent molecules attract much attention from a functional viewpoint. however, their designed preparation and precise structural characterization remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that cocrystallization of tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives (CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py, respectively) yields non&#8208;stoichiometric mixed frameworks through networking via hydrogen bonding. The composition ratio of CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py in the framework was determined by single crystalline X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, indicating that the mixed frameworks were formed over a wide range of composition ratios. Furthermore, microscopic Raman spectroscopy on the single crystal indicates that the components are not uniformly distributed such as ideal solid solution, but are done gradationally or inhomogeneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic DNA&#8208;Assisted Mass Production of Arbitrary Single&#8208;Stranded DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is a cornerstone for life and materials science, yet the purity, quantity, length, and customizability of synthetic DNA are still limiting in various applications. Here we present PECAN, paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (DNA enzymes or deoxyribozymes), which enables mass production of ssDNA of arbitrary sequence (up to 7,000 nucleotides, or nt) with single&#8208;base precision. At the core of PECAN technique are two newly&#8208;identified classes of DNAzymes, each robustly self&#8208;hydrolyzing with minimal sequence requirement up&#8208; or down&#8208;stream of its cleavage site. Flanking the target ssDNA with a pair of such DNAzymes generates a precursor ssDNA amplifiable by pseudogene&#8208;recombinant bacteriophage, which subsequently releases the target ssDNA in large quantities after efficient auto&#8208;processing. PECAN produces ssDNA of virtually any terminal bases and compositions with &gt;98.5% purity at the milligram&#8208;to&#8208;gram scale. We demonstrate the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for RNA in situ detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Switching Cu(II)/Cu(I) Single Sites Catalyze High&#8208;rate and Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we first design a model of reversible redox&#8208;switching&#160;metal&#8211;organic framework single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets, where the abundant metal single sites benefit for highly selective CO2 reduction, while the reversible redox&#8208;switching metal sites can effectively activate CO2 molecules. Taking the synthetic Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectra unravel the reversible switching Cu(II)/Cu(I) single sites initially accept photoexcited electrons and then donate them to CO2 molecules, which favors the rate&#8208;liming activation into CO2&#948;&#8208;, verified by in&#8208;situ FTIR spectra and Gibbs free energy calculations. As an outcome, Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets achieve near 100% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CO with a high rate of 860 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without any sacrifice reagent or photosensitizer, where both the activity and selectivity outperform previously reported photocatalysts evaluated under similar conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Multiple Domain Ligation for Proteins using Asparaginyl Endopeptidase by Selection of Appropriate Ligation Sites Based on Steric Hindrance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three domain fragments of a multi&#8208;domain protein, ER&#8208;60, were ligated in two short linker regions using asparaginyl endopeptidase not involving denaturation. To identify appropriate ligation sites, by selecting several potential ligation sites with fewer mutations around two short linker regions, their ligation efficiencies and the functions of the ligated ER&#8208;60s were examined experimentally. To evaluate the dependence of ligation efficiencies on the ligation sites computationally, steric hinderances around the sites for the ligation were calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Utilizing the steric hindrance, a site&#8208;dependent ligation potential index was introduced as reproducing the experimental ligation efficiency. Referring to this index, the reconstruction of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded by the ligation of the three domains for the first time. In addition, the new ligation potential index well&#8208;worked for application to other domain ligations. Therefore, the index may serve as a more time&#8208;effective tool for multi&#8208;site ligations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pair@Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Platform for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation, a seminal strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules, remains largely unmet in terms of activation by non&#8208;metal sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, as demonstrated by combined computational and experimental studies, we present a general strategy for integrating rationally designed molecular chiral frustrated Lewis pair (CFLP) with porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to construct the catalyst CFLP@MOF that can efficiently promote the asymmetric hydrogenation in a heterogeneous manner, which for the first time extends the concept of chiral frustrated Lewis pair from homogeneous system to heterogeneous catalysis. Significantly, the developed CFLP@MOF, inherits the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, with high activity/enantio&#8208;selectivity and excellent recyclability/regenerability. Our work not only advances CFLP@MOF as a new platform for heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation, but also opens a new avenue for the design and preparation of advanced catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Metal Adatoms in a Surface&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrogenation Reaction on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and electronic structure theory, we show that, contrary to previous consensus, surface adatoms can play a central role in the highly chemoselective cyclodehydrogenation of organic polymers.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation reactions are key steps in many metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical processes and in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of atomically precise nanomaterials. The principal role of the metal substrate in these reactions is undisputed, but the role of metal adatoms remains, to a large extent, unanswered, particularly on gold substrates. Here, we discuss their importance by studying the surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation on Au(111) as an ideal model case. We choose a polymer theoretically predicted to give one of two cyclization products depending on the presence or absence of gold adatoms. Scanning probe microscopy experiments observe only the product associated with adatoms. We challenge the prevalent understanding of surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation, unveiling the catalytic role of adatoms and their effect on regioselectivity. The study adds new perspectives to the understanding of metal catalysis and the design of on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols for novel carbon nanomaterials.

         <title>Minimum Information Standards in Chemistry: A Call for Better Research Data Management Practices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information systems (LIMS) allow data management and simplification of research and publication. Minimum standards for information management are urgently needed to support chemists with the reporting of their data in a structured manner. The time is ripe to liberate data and make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) for all.







Abstract
Research data management (RDM) is needed to assist experimental advances and data collection in the chemical sciences. Many funders require RDM because experiments are often paid for by taxpayers and the resulting data should be deposited sustainably for posterity. However, paper notebooks are still common in laboratories and research data is often stored in proprietary and/or dead&#8208;end file formats without experimental context. Data must mature beyond a mere supplement to a research paper. Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information management systems (LIMS) allow researchers to manage data better and they simplify research and publication. Thus, an agreement is needed on minimum information standards for data handling to support structured approaches to data reporting. As digitalization becomes part of curricular teaching, future generations of digital native chemists will embrace RDM and ELN as an organic part of their research.

         <title>Acceleration of Cathode Interfacial Kinetics by Liquid Organosulfides in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of the solid&#8208;liquid interface in Li&#8722;S battery, a strategy of replacing sulfur with liquid organosulfide (PTS) and constructing a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte using LHCE is reported, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the reaction mechanism to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus obtaining a good reaction kinetics and cycling stability.







Abstract
Great efforts have been made to tackle the issues of the shuttle effect and kinetics hysteresis in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery, but few on tuning the reaction path of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a strategy to replace inorganic sulfur with liquid organosulfide and construct a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid conversion reaction to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus greatly improving the reaction kinetics. The Li|PTS half&#8208;cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at 0.5&#8197;C, with a capacity retention of 64.9&#8201;% after 750 cycles. The Li|PTS pouch cell with a high PTS loading of 3.1&#8197;g delivers a maximum capacity of 997&#8197;mAh and maintains 82.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 50 cycles at the current of 100&#8197;mA. This work enriches the reaction mechanism of Li&#8722;S batteries and provides new insights for the development of interphase chemistry in the design of cathodes.

         <title>Engineering of Pyroelectric Crystals Decoupled from Piezoelectricity as Illustrated by Doped &#945;&#8208;Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From symmetry considerations, pyroelectric crystal is expected to be piezoelectric at least in its polar direction. This work demonstrates synthetic method based on enantio&#8208;specific co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals. By choosing appropriate co&#8208;dopant with coincident contribution to pyroelectricity and opposing contributions to piezoelectricity, one can enhance the first while suppressing the second. Thus, break the linkage between the effects.







Abstract
Design of pyroelectric crystals decoupled from piezoelectricity is not only a topic of scientific curiosity but also demonstrates effects in principle that have the potential to be technologically advantageous. Here we report a new method for the design of such materials. Thus, the co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals with tailor&#8208;made guest molecules, as illustrated by the doping of &#945;&#8208;glycine with different amino acids (Threonine, Alanine and Serine). The polarization of those crystals displays two distinct contributions, one arising from the difference in dipole moments between guest and host and the other from the displacement of host molecules from their symmetry&#8208;related positions. These contributions exhibit different temperature dependences and response to mechanical deformation. Thus, providing a proof of concept for the ability to design pyroelectric materials with reduced piezoelectric coefficient (d22) to a minimal value, below the resolution limit of the method (&lt;0.005&#8197;pm/V).

         <title>Single Atom Ring Contraction of Peptide Macrocycles Using Cornforth Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective transformations of densely functionalized scaffolds have been a topic of intense interest in chemical synthesis. Herein we have repurposed the rarely used Cornforth rearrangement as a tool to effect a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in cyclic peptide backbones. Investigations into the kinetics of the rearrangement were carried out to understand the impact of electronic factors, ring size, and linker type on the reaction efficiency. Conformational analysis was undertaken and showed how subtle differences in the peptide backbone result in substrate&#8208;dependent reaction profiles. This methodology can now be used to perform conformation&#8208;activity studies. The chemistry also offers an opportunity to install building blocks that are not compatible with traditional C&#8208;to&#8208;N iterative synthesis of macrocycle precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient production of nanoporous block copolymers with&#160;arbitrary structural characters for advanced membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The great significance of boosting the design of percolating nanopore structures in block copolymers (BCPs) for varied use cases has been widely demonstrated in the past several decades. However, it still remains challenging to prepare the desired porous structures in a rapid, facile, and universal manner. Here we develop an unconventional and benchtop strategy to rapidly generate the nanoporous BCPs with arbitrary structural characters regardless of the BCP bulk morphology. This universal pore&#8208;forming strategy enables the sustainable CO2&#8208;based BCPs to form the advanced membranes with 1 s soaking for efficiently rejecting 94.2% brilliant blue R (826 g/mol). At the same time, the water permeance retains around 1020 L/(m2&#183;h&#183;bar), which is 1~3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other membranes. This strategy may offer a fantastic opportunity to introduce percolating pore structures in those newly developed BCPs with which the previously reported pore&#8208;forming methods may not deal.</dc:description>

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Molecular Rotor Fluorogenic Trehalose Probe for Live Mycobacteria Detection and Drug&#8208;Susceptibility Testing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the speed, specificity, sensitivity, and accessibility of mycobacteria detection tools are important challenges for tuberculosis (TB) research and diagnosis. In this regard, previously reported fluorogenic trehalose analogues have shown potential, but their green&#8208;emitting dyes may limit sensitivity and applications in complex settings. Here, we describe a trehalose&#8208;based fluorogenic probe featuring a molecular rotor turn&#8208;on fluorophore with bright far&#8208;red emission (RMR&#8208;Tre). RMR&#8208;Tre, which exploits the unique biosynthetic enzymes and environment of the mycobacterial outer membrane to achieve fluorescence activation, enables fast, no&#8208;wash, low&#8208;background fluorescence detection of live mycobacteria. Aided by the red&#8208;shifted molecular rotor fluorophore, RMR&#8208;Tre exhibited up to a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in M. tuberculosis labeling compared to existing fluorogenic trehalose probes. We show that RMR&#8208;Tre reports on M. tuberculosis drug resistance in a facile assay, demonstrating its potential as a TB diagnostic tool.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Photophysics in Hydrazone&#8208;based Hierarchical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confinement&#8208;imposed photophysics was probed for novel stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrazone&#8208;based compounds demonstrating a conceptual difference in their behavior within 2D versus 3D porous matrices for the first time. The challenges associated with photoswitch isomerization arising from host interactions with photochromic compounds in 2D scaffolds could be overcome in 3D materials. Solution&#8208;like photoisomerization rate constants were realized for sterically demanding hydrazone derivatives in the solid state through their coordinative immobilization in 3D scaffolds. According to steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements and theoretical modeling, this approach provides access to hydrazone&#8208;based materials with fast photoisomerization kinetics in the solid state. Fast isomerization of integrated hydrazone derivatives allows for probing and tailoring resonance energy transfer (ET) processes as a function of excitation wavelength, providing a novel pathway for ET modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Changes of C&#8211;H Bond Lengths in Chiral Zinc Complexes Induced by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to better understand the effect of the non&#8208;covalent weak interactions on the molecule, we have explored a variety of weak interactions such as improper H&#8208;bonding (HB), tetrel bonds (TBs) and halogen bonds, in fluorinated chiral zinc complexes. High resolution neutron diffraction studies revealed the methylene carbon hydrogen bonds elongation and shortening due to the TB and improper HB interactions, respectively. To show the accumulative effects of multiple weak interactions on the C&#8208;H bond, three types of tetrel bonds have been carefully examined. We have also shown how the C&#8208;H bond elongation can be easily offset by forming an improper HB with the H atom from this C&#8208;H bond. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and electrostatic potential analysis investigations have been used to affirm the nature of the interactions based on density functional theory (DFT) and other related calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Anthrone&#8208;based Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthrones and analogues are structural cores shared by diverse pharmacologically active natural and synthetic compounds. The sp  2  &#8208;rich nature imposes inherent obstruction to introduce stereogenic element onto the tricyclic aromatic backbone. In our pursuit to expand the chemical space of axial chirality, a novel type of axially chiral anthrone&#8208;derived skeleton was discovered. This work establishes oxime ether as suitable functionality to furnish axial chirality on symmetric anthrone skeletons through stereoselective condensation of the carbonyl entity with long&#8208;range chirality control. The enantioenriched anthrones could be elaborated into dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered  N  &#8208;heterocycles containing well&#8208;defined stereogenic center via Beckmann rearrangement with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Control of Organocatalyst in Strongly Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acidic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral imidodiphosphates (IDPs) have emerged as strong Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts for many enantioselective processes, however, the dynamic transformation between O,O&#8208;syn and O,O&#8208;anti conformers results in typical low enantioselectivity. Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy&#8208;MOFs with different topologies are made from an enantiopure 1,1'&#8208;biphenol IDP&#8208;based tetracarboxylate ligand. Whereas the ligand adopts a 4&#8208; or 3&#8208;connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to take only a single O,O&#8208;syn conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4&#8208;c IDP that takes a relative less compact shape than the 3&#8208;c one can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid to catalyse the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization reaction with up to 96% enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical syngas production from aqueous CO2 is a promising technique for carbon capture and utilization. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and tunable syngas production by integrating a single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with a bimetallic Ag/Pd alloy cathode. A record syngas production activity of 81.9 &#181;mol&#8226;cm&#8208;2&#8226;h&#8208;1 (CO/H2 ratio: ~1:1) has been achieved under artificial sunlight (AM 1.5 G) with an excellent durability. Systematic studies reveal that the Co single&#8208;atom could effectively extract the holes from Fe2O3 photoanodes and serve as active&#8208;sites for promoting oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the Pd and Ag atoms in bimetallic cathodes could selectively adsorb CO2 and protons for facilitating CO production. Further incorporating with a photovoltaic for utilizing the solar&#8208;light (&gt;600 nm) to construct a bias&#8208;free CO2 reduction device, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO and solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion efficiencies could be achieved up to 1.36 and 1.33 %, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Multicolour Luminescence of Organic Materials: Internal Mechanism and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excitation&#8208;dependent emission (Ex&#8208;de) materials have been of considerable academic interest and have potential applications in real life. Such multicolour luminescence is a characteristic exception to the ubiquitously accepted Kasha&#8217;s rule. This phenomenon has been increasingly presented in some studies on different luminescence systems; however, a systematic overview of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is currently absent. Herein, we resolve this issue by classifying multicolour luminescence from single chromophores and dual/ternary chromophores, as well as multiple emitting species. The underlying processes are described based on electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which the phenomenon occurs. Before we present it in categories, related photophysical and photochemical foundations are introduced. This systematic overview will provide a clear approach to designing multicolour luminescence materials for special applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Gradient Stretchable Aerogels for Ultrabroad&#8208;Range&#8208;Response Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Wearable Electronics and High&#8208;Efficient Separators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broad&#8208;range&#8208;response pressure&#8208;sensitive wearable electronics are urgently needed but their preparation remains a challenge. Herein, we report unprecedented bioinspired wearable electronics based on stretchable and superelastic reduced graphene oxide/polyurethane nanocomposite aerogels with gradient porous structures by a sol&#8208;gel/hot pressing/freeze casting/ambient pressure drying strategy. The gradient structure with a hot&#8208;pressed layer promotes strain transfer and resistance variation under high pressures, leading to an ultrabroad detection range of 1 Pa&#8208;12.6 MPa, one of the broadest ranges ever reported. They can withstand 10000 compression cycles under 1 MPa, which can&#8217;t be achieved by traditional flexible pressure sensors. They can be applied for broad&#8208;range&#8208;response electronic skins and monitoring various physical signals/motions and ultrahigh pressures of automobile tires. Moreover, the gradient aerogels can be used as high&#8208;efficient gradient separators for water purification.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of hollow nanoreactors offers a potential opportunity for achieving a better catalytic performance owing to the higher controllability of molecular kinetic behavior within the hollow nanoreactors. Nevertheless, the specific molecular catalytic mechanism occurring inside hollow nanoreactors still remains to be adequately recognized, which is crucial for inducing controllable molecular behaviors with specific purposes. This review article presents a focused discussion about the basic concept of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory for hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the intrinsic correlation between nanoreactor structural parameters and kinetic behaviors, in an attempt to realizing controllable catalysis. We aim to provide in&#8208;depth insights into understanding kinetics within typical hollow nanoreactors. The perspectives proposed in this paper may contribute to the development of the fundamental theoretical framework of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein as a Target for Metallo&#8208;Anti&#8208;Neurodegenerative Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique thermodynamic and kinetic coordination chemistry of ruthenium allows it to modulate key adverse aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. We show that the low&#8208;toxic Ru(III) complex trans&#8208;[ImH][RuCl4(Me2SO)(Im)] (NAMI&#8208;A) has dual inhibitory effects on both aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;syn with submicromolar affinity, and disassembles pre&#8208;formed fibrils. NAMI&#8208;A abolishes the cytotoxicity of &#945;&#8208;syn towards neuronal cells and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's. Multinuclear NMR and MS analyses show that NAMI&#8208;A binds to residues involved in protein aggregation and membrane binding. NMR studies reveal the key steps in pro&#8208;drug activation and the effect of activated NAMI&#8208;A species on protein folding. Our findings provide a new basis for designing ruthenium complexes which could mitigate &#945;&#8208;syn&#8208;induced Parkinson's pathology differently from organic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Interception of the Remote Position of Vinylcarbene Silver Complex Intermediates by C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trapping of the elusive vinylogous position of a vinyl carbene with an aliphatic Csp3&#8208;H bond has been achieved for the first time during a silver&#8208;catalyzed carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM) process. A Tpx&#8208;containing silver complex first promotes the generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene which triggers CAM, generating a subsequent donor&#8208;donor vinyl silver carbene species, which then undergoes a selective vinylogous C(sp3)&#8208;H bond insertion, leading to the synthesis of a new family of benzoazepines. Density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations unveil the reaction mechanism, which allows proposing that the C&#8208;H bond insertion reaction takes place in a stepwise manner, with the hydrogen shift being the rate determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly polarized light probes excited&#8208;state delocalization in rectangular ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl chromophores have a rigid, planar p&#8208;system and show bright fluorescence featuring pronounced vibrational structure. Such moieties are ideal for studying interchromophoric interactions and delocalization of electronic excitations. We report the synthesis of helical polymers with a rigid square structure based on spiro&#8208;linked ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl units. The variation of circular dichroism with increasing chain length provides direct evidence for delocalization of electronic excitations over at least 10 monomeric units. The change in the degree of circular polarization of the fluorescence across the vibronic side bands shows that vibrational motion can localize the excitation dynamically to almost one single unit through breakdown of the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation. The dynamic conversion between delocalized and localized excited states provides a new paradigm for interpreting circular dichroism in helical polymers such as proteins and polynucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic, Regioselective 1,4&#8208;Fluorodifunctionalization of Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products. The process allows E,Z&#8208;mixed dienes to be processed to a single E&#8208;alkene isomer, and leverages an inexpensive and operationally convenient I(I)/I(III) catalysis platform. The first example of catalytic 1,4&#8208;difluorination is disclosed and subsequently evolved to enable 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;difunctionalization, which allows &#948;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;alcohol and amine derivatives to be forged in a single operation. The protocol is compatible with a variety of nucleophiles including fluoride, nitriles, carboxylic acids, alcohols and even water thereby allowing highly functionalized products, with a stereocenter bearing both C(sp3)&#8208;F and C(sp3)&#8208;CF3 groups, to be generated rapidly. Scalability (up to 3 mmol), and facile post&#8208;reaction modifications are demonstrated to underscore the utility of the method in expanding organofluorine chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Bayesian Self&#8208;Optimization for Telescoped Continuous Flow Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optimization of multistep chemical syntheses is critical for the rapid development of new pharmaceuticals. However, concatenating individually optimized reactions can lead to inefficient multistep syntheses, owing to chemical interdependencies between the steps. Herein, we develop an automated continuous flow platform for the simultaneous optimization of telescoped reactions. Our approach is applied to a Heck&#8208;cyclization&#8208;deprotection reaction sequence, used in the synthesis of a precursor for 1&#8208;methyltetrahydroisoquinoline&#160;C&#8208;5 functionalization. A simple method for multipoint sampling with a single online HPLC instrument was designed, enabling accurate quantification of each reaction, and an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathways. Notably, integration of Bayesian optimization techniques identified an 81% overall yield in just 14 hours, and revealed the favorable competing pathway for formation of the desired product.</dc:description>

         <title>Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;ion Binding as a Gelation Motif in Cellulose Ether Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanometer&#8208;sized anions (nano&#8208;ions) like polyoxometalates and boron clusters exhibit so&#8208;called superchaotropic behavior, which describes their strong binding to hydrated non&#8208;ionic matter in water. We show here that nano&#8208;ions, at millimolar concentrations, dramatically enhance the viscosity and induce gelation of aqueous solutions of non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers (CEs), a class of widely utilized polymers known for their thickening and gel&#8208;forming ability. These phenomena arise from an interplay of attractive forces and repulsive electrostatic forces between CE&#8208;chains upon nano&#8208;ion binding. The attractive forces manifest themselves as aggregation of CE&#8208;chains into a physically crosslinked polymer network (gel). In turn, the electrostatic repulsions hamper the viscosity increase and gelation. Superchaotropic nano&#8208;ion binding emerges as a novel and general physical crosslinking motif for CE&#8208;solutions and exceeds by far the conventional thickening effects of classical salts and ionic surfactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered Macro/Microporous Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Toxic Pollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In case of pollutant segregation fast mass diffusion is a fundamental criterion in order to achieve improved performance. The rapid mass transport through porous materials can be achieved by availing large open pores followed by easy and complete accessibility of functional sites. Inducing macroporosity into such materials could serve as ideal solution providing access to large macropores that offer unhindered transport of analyte and full exposure to interactive sites. Moreover, the challenge to configure the ionic&#8208;functionality with macroporosity could emerge as an unparalleled avenue toward pollutants separation. Herein, we strategized a synthetic protocol for construction of a positively charged hierarchically&#8208;porous ordered interconnected macro&#8208;structure of organic framework where the size and number of macropores can easily be tuned. The ordered macropores with strong electrostatic interaction synergistically exhibited ultrafast removal efficiency toward various toxic pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>An Amorphous n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Ultra&#8208;Rigid Planar Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High charge carrier mobility polymer semiconductors are always semi&#8208;crystalline. Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. Here we report the first near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with decent electron mobility, which features remarkably rigid, straight and planar polymer backbone. The molecular design strategy is to copolymerize two fused&#8208;ring building blocks which are both electron&#8208;accepting, centrosymmetrical and planar. The polymer is the alternating copolymer of double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and benzobisthiazole (BBTz) unit. It shows a decent electron mobility of 0.34 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The excellent electron transporting property of the polymer is possibly due to the ultrahigh backbone stiffness, small &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and high molecular weight.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfectly Encoding &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Anions in the RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE = Y, Yb, Lu) Family with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Balanced Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal, which simultaneously possess strong second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and desired optical anisotropy, is a core optical material accessible to the modern optoelectronics. Accompanied by strong SHG effect in a NLO crystal, a contradictory problem of overlarge birefringence is ignored, leading to low frequency doubling efficiency and poor beam quality. Herein, a series of rare earth cyanurates RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE = Y, Yb, Lu) were successfully characterized by 3D electron diffraction technique. Based on a "three birds with one stone" strategy, they enable the simultaneous fulfillment of strong SHG responses (2.5 &#8208; 4.2 &#215; KH2PO4), short UV cutoff (ca. 220 nm) and applicable birefringence (ca. 0.15 at 800 nm) by the introduction of rare earth coordination control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C3N3O3)3&#8211; anions. These findings provide high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wavelength NLO materials and highlight the exploration of cyanurates as a new research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Tolane&#8208;Perfluorotolane Assembly as Supramolecular Base Pair Replacement in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions offer outstanding possi&#173;bilities for engineering of supramolecular systems, including nucleic acids. Here, we implement the tolane&#8208;perfluorotolane interaction as base pair replacement in DNA. Tolane (THH) and perfluorotolane (TFF) moieties were connected to acyclic backbone units, comprising glycol nucleic acid (GNA) or butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) building blocks, that were incorporated via phosphoramidite chemistry at opposite positions in a DNA duplex. Thermodynamic analyses by UV thermal melting revealed a compelling stabilization by THH/TFF heteropairs only when connected to the BuNA backbone, but not with the shorter GNA linker. Detailed NMR studies confirmed the preference of the BuNA backbone for enhanced polar &#960;&#8208;stacking. This work defines how orthogonal supramolecular interactions can be tailored by small constitutional changes in the DNA backbone, and it inspires future studies of arene&#8208;fluoroarene&#8208;programmed assembly of DNA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nitrenes and nitrenoids are highly reactive species and the proposed key intermediates in nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compound synthesis. In this work, we developed a practical method for the synthesis of phenanthridines by the reaction of oxime and Grignard reagents (with or without diethylzinc) via ring&#8208;expansion of magnesium coordinated nitrenoid complex as the key step. The method has been used to synthesize optically active planar chiral ferrocenyl phenanthridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;reservoir hydrogel electrolyte for long&#8208;term cycling Zn/PANI batteries in wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced aqueous batteries are promising for next generation flexible and wearable devices owing to the high safety, yet still requiring better cycling stability and high specific capacity in wide temperature range. Herein, a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte (PAGE) with 3 M Zn(ClO4)2 was fabricated for high performance Zn/polyaniline (PANI) batteries. The &#8208;SO3&#8208;H+ function group in PAGE can endow the Zn/PANI battery with following merits: firstly, accelerating the redox reaction kinetics for PANI by constant proton generation; secondly, increasing the specific capacity by boosting the reaction sites between ions and PANI functional groups; thirdly, suppressing the side reaction and dendrites by inducing the (002) crystal plane formation. In addition, the anti&#8208;freezing performance for the hydrogel is also optimized by the salt and hydrogel, with a high ionic conductivity of 14.2 mS cm&#8208;1 at &#8208;35oC. As a consequence, even at &#8208;35oC, the Zn/Zn symmetrical battery can keep stable for more than 1,500 h under 2 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Zn/PANI battery can provide ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 79.6 mA h g&#8208;1 for more than 70,000 cycles at 15 A g&#8208;1. This proton&#8208;supplying strategy by polymeric acid hydrogel may further propel the development of high performance aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

Herein, a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte (PAGE) with 3 M Zn(ClO4)2 was fabricated for high performance Zn/polyaniline (PANI) batteries. The -SO3-H+ function group in PAGE can endow the Zn/PANI battery with following merits: firstly, accelerating the redox reaction kinetics for PANI by constant proton generation; secondly, increasing the specific capacity by boosting the reaction sites between ions and PANI functional groups; thirdly, suppressing the side reaction and dendrites by inducing the (002) crystal plane formation. In addition, the anti-freezing performance for the hydrogel is also optimized by the salt and hydrogel, with a high ionic conductivity of 14.2 mS cm-1 at -35oC. As a consequence, even at -35oC, the Zn/Zn symmetrical battery can keep stable for more than 1,500 h under 2 mA cm-2, and the Zn/PANI battery can provide ultra-high stable specific capacity of 79.6 mA h g-1 for more than 70,000 cycles at 15 A g-1.

         <title>Large&#8208;area Free&#8208;standing Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Films by Liquid&#8208;air Interfacial Polymerization for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesizing large&#8208;area free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) films is of vital importance for their applications but&#160;is still a&#160;big&#160;challenge. Herein, we reported the synthesis of large metalloporphyrin&#8208;based COF films and their applications for oxygen electrocatalysis. The reaction of&#160;meso&#8208;benzohydrazide&#8208;substituted metal porphyrins with tris&#8208;aldehyde linkers afforded free&#8208;standing COF films at the liquid&#8208;air interface. These films can be scaled up to 3000 cm2area and display great mechanical stability and structural integrity. Importantly, the Co&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based films are efficient for electrocatalytic O2&#160;reduction and evolution reactions.&#160;A flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled using the films and showed high&#160;performance with a charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap of 0.88 V at 1 mA/cm2&#160;and high stability under bent conditions (0&#176;&#160;to 180&#176;). This work thus presents a strategy to synthesize&#160;functionalized&#160;COF&#160;films&#160;with&#160;high quality for uses in flexible electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Proteins with Base&#8208;labile Posttranslational Modifications Enabled by a Boc&#8208;SPPS Based General Strategy Towards Peptide C&#8208;terminal Salicylaldehyde Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical synthesis of proteins bearing base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) is a challenging task; for instance,  O  &#8208;acetylation and  S  &#8208;palmitoylation PTMs that cannot survive Fmoc removal conditions during Fmoc&#8208;solid phase peptide synthesis. In this work, we developed a new Boc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;based strategy for the synthesis of peptide C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde (SAL) esters, which are the key reaction partners in Ser/Thr ligation and Cys/Pen ligation. The strategy utilized the semicarbazone&#8208;modified AM&#160;(aminomethyl) resin, which could support the Boc&#8208;SPPS and release the peptide SAL ester upon treatment with TFA/H  2  O and pyruvic acid. The non&#8208;oxidative aldehyde regeneration was fully compatible with all the canonical amino acids. Armed with this strategy, we finished the syntheses of the  O  &#8208;acetylated protein histone H3(S10ac, T22ac) and the hydrophobic  S  &#8208;palmitoylated peptide derived from caveolin&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Diboron(4)&#8208;Catalyzed Remote [3+2] Cycloaddition of Cyclopropanes via Dearomative/Rearomative Radical Transmission through Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring structures such as pyridine, cyclopentane or their combinations are important motifs in bioactive molecules. In contrast to previous cycloaddition reactions that necessitated a directly bonded initiating functional group, this work demonstrated a novel through&#8208;(hetero)arene radical transmission concept for selective activation of a remote bond. An efficient, metal&#8208;free and atom&#8208;economical [3+2] cycloaddition between 4&#8208;pyridinyl cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes has been developed for modular synthesis of pyridine&#8208;substituted cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes that are difficult to access using known methods. This complexity&#8208;building reaction was catalyzed by a very simple and inexpensive diboron(4) compound and took place via dearomative/rearomative processes. The substrate scope was broad and more than 100 new compounds were prepared in generally high yields. Mechanistic experiments and density function theory (DFT) investigation supported a radical relay catalytic cycle involving alkylidene dihydropyridine radical intermediates and boronyl radical transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiaromatic Sapphyrin Isomer: Transformation into Contracted Porphyrinoids with Variable Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sapphyrin is a pentapyrrolic expanded porphyrin with a 22&#960; aromatic character. Herein, we report the synthesis of a 20&#960; antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer  1  by oxidative cyclization of a pentapyrrane precursor  P5  with a terminal &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole. The resulting isomer  1  , containing a mis&#8208;linked bipyrrole unit in the skeleton, exhibits a reactivity for further oxidation due to the distinct antiaromatic electronic structure, affording a fused macrocycle  2, possessing a spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing [5.6.5.6]&#8208;tetracyclic structure. Subsequent treatment with an acid afforded a weakly aromatic pyrrolone&#8208;appended N&#8208;confused corrole  3, and thermal fusion gave a [5.6.5.7]&#8208;tetracyclic&#8208;ring&#8208;embedded 14&#960; aromatic triphyrin(2.1.1) analog  4. The cyclization at the mis&#8208;linked pyrrole moiety of  P5  played a crucial role in synthesizing the antiaromatic porphyrinoid susceptible to facile transformation to novel porphyrinoids with variable aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Arylalkenes with Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric hydroamination of alkenes with Lewis basic amines is of great interest and importance but remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we developed a Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of arylalkenes directly using commercially accessible secondary amines. This process enables the efficient access to valuable &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with arylalkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated electrophilic cationic alkylcobalt(IV) species and free amines. This radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy not only provides a straightforward and alternative approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, but also underpins the substantial opportunities in developing asymmetric radical functionalization of alkenes with various free nucleophiles in oxidative MHAT catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Proton Transfer on Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Manganese Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of proton transfer on water oxidation has hardly been measurably established in heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, two isomorphous manganese phosphates (NH4MnPO4&#183;H2O and KMnPO4&#183;H2O) were designed to form an ideal platform to study the effect of proton transfer on water oxidation. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in NH4MnPO4&#183;H2O has been proven to be solely responsible for its better activity. The differences of the proton transfer kinetics in the two materials indicate a fast proton hopping transfer process with a low activation energy in NH4MnPO4&#183;H2O. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network can effectively promote the proton transfer between adjacent Mn sites and further stabilize the Mn(III)&#8208;OH intermediates. The faster proton transfer results in a higher proportion of zeroth&#8208;order in [H+] for OER. Thus, proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been measurably observed to bring detailed insights into the mechanism of water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulating Metal Nanoparticles into a Layered Zeolite Precursor with Surface Silanol Nests Enhances Sintering Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal nanoparticles are used as heterogeneous catalysts but often deactivated due to sintering at high temperatures. Confining metal species into a porous matrix reduces sintering, yet supports rarely provide additional stabilization. Here, we used the silanol&#8208;rich layered zeolite IPC&#8208;1P to stabilize ultra&#8208;small Rh nanoparticles. By adjusting the IPC&#8208;1P interlayer space through swelling, we prepared various architectures, including microporous and disordered mesoporous. In&#8208;situ scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed that Rh nanoparticles are resistant to sintering at high temperature (750 oC, 6hrs). Rh clusters strongly bind to surface silanol quadruplets at IPC&#8208;1P layers by hydrogen transfer to clusters, while high silanol density hinders their migration based on density functional theory calculations. Ultimately, combining swelling with long&#8208;chain surfactant and utilizing metal&#8208;silanol interactions resulted in a novel, catalytically active material &#8208; Rh@IPC_C22.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Square Planar Cobalt (II) Complexes via Sodium Mediated Cobaltation of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mixed Na/CoII tris(amido) base enables the selective cobaltation of a range of fluoroarenes furnishing a new family of square planar tetra(aryl) complexes. Mechanistic investigations shed light on the key roles played by each metal, uncovering two alternative types of bimetallic cooperation for the metalation step, which is then followed by a fast ligand rearrangement driven by the coordination preference of the alkali&#8208;metal.







Abstract
While cobalt complexes have already shown their potential for C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation of fluoroarenes, their reactivity as metalating agents via Co&#8722;H exchange towards these substrates has not been explored. Herein, we report a Co(HMDS)2 [HMDS=N(SiMe3)2] system which, when synergistically enhanced via sodium amide Na(HMDS) mediation, can render chemo&#8208; and regioselective cobaltation of a series of fluoroarenes to produce a new class of homoleptic square planar [Na2CoAr4] complexes. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the key roles of the Na/Co counterparts in a stepwise sodiation/cobalt transmetalation process, leading to this novel C&#8722;H metalation. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, this process can occur inter&#8208; or intramolecularly, furnishing transient [NaCo(HMDS)2Ar] intermediates which can undergo ligand rearrangement to afford [Na2CoAr4] with concomitant formation of Co(HMDS)2 and [NaCo(HMDS)3].

         <title>Pyrogallate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with a Two&#8208;Dimensional Secondary Building Unit</title>

         <dc:description>
Solvothermal reaction of 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl with Fe2+ generates a MOF with an unusual topology, comprising 2D secondary building units of mixed&#8208;valence Fe2+/Fe3+ sites, which enable strong electronic interactions.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a rare two&#8208;dimensional (2D) secondary building unit (SBU). The SBU comprises mixed&#8208;valent Fe2+ and Fe3+ metal ions bridged by oxygen atoms pertaining to the polytopic ligand 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl, which also define the iron&#8208;oxide 2D layers. Overall, the anionic framework exhibits rare topology and evidences strong electronic communication between the mixed&#8208;valence iron sites. These results highlight the importance of dimensionality control of MOF SBUs for discovering new topologies in reticular chemistry, and especially for improving electronic communication within the MOF skeleton.

         <dc:description>Condensation of 2&#8208;vinylanilines and conjugated aldehydes followed by an efficient light&#8208;mediated cyclisation selectively yields either substituted tetrahydroquinolines with typically high dr, or in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst the synthesis of quinoline derivatives is demonstrated. These atom economical processes require mild conditions, with the substrate scope demonstrating excellent site selectivity and functional group tolerance, including azaarene&#8208;bearing substrates. A thorough experimental mechanistic investigation explores multiple pathways and the key role that imine and iminium intermediates play in the absorption of visible light to generate reactive excited states. The synthetic utility of the reactions is demonstrated on gram scale quantities in both batch and flow, alongside further manipulation of the medicinally relevant products.</dc:description>

However, the generation of formyl radicals for organic synthesis applications remains unknown. Herein we report the first formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro N&#8208;methoxyphthalimides, which selectively synthesize aldehydes by alkene hydroformylation under mild photoredox conditions. The aldehydes can be installed on acrylates, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl ketones, and complex steroids by radical hydroformylation in excellent chemoselectivity and regioselectivity. The concerted hydrochloride elimination for the formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro methoxy radicals is established by experimental and computational approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Transport Properties in Interconnected Enargite&#8208;Stannite Type Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A particular biphasic compound, which consists of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type tetrahedral frameworks at a nanoscale, has been synthesized. The complex crystal chemistry of such nanocomposites rises the issue of the role of the two structures and of their interfaces in the mechanism governing their electrical and thermal conductivities.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms that connect heat and electron transport with crystal structures and defect chemistry is fundamental to develop materials with thermoelectric properties. In this work, we synthesized a series of self&#8208;doped compounds Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 through Cu for Mn substitution. Using a combination of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and precession&#8208;assisted electron diffraction tomography, we evidence that the materials are composed of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type structures, via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. By combining experiments with ab initio electron and phonon calculations, we discuss the structure&#8211;thermoelectric properties relationships and clarify the interesting crystal chemistry in this system. We demonstrate that excess Cu+ substituted for Mn2+ dopes holes into the top of the valence band, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the power factor and figure of merit ZT.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that connect heat and electron transport with crystal structures and defect chemistry is fundamental to develop materials with thermoelectric properties. In this work, we synthesized a series of self-doped compounds Cu&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;GeS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; through Cu for Mn substitution. Using a combination of powder X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and precession-assisted electron diffraction tomography, we evidence that the materials are composed of interconnected enargite- and stannite-type structures, via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. By combining experiments with ab initio electron and phonon calculations, we discuss the structure&#8211;thermoelectric properties relationships and clarify the interesting crystal chemistry in this system. We demonstrate that excess Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; substituted for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dopes holes into the top of the valence band, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the power factor and figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfenofunctionalization of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Synthesis of SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized chiral allyl species, with an alkenyl CF3 group, were prepared with excellent selectivity by selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of allylboronic acids. The method can be used to access chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr compounds.







Abstract
We report herein a new method for the synthesis of densely functionalized chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr species with a separate CF3 functionality. The synthetic approach is based on selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of chiral &#945;&#8208;CF3 allylboronic acids. The reactions proceeded with remarkably high stereo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, based on the formation of a stable thiiranium ion followed by rapid deborylative ring opening.

         <title>Ion Adsorption and Desorption at the CaF2&#8208;Water Interface Probed by Flow Experiments and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>

Uncovering Ion Adsorption Reactions. The combination of surface&#8208;sensitive v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments allows to uncover the interplay of a dominant fluoride and a weak calcium adsorption reaction at the fluorite&#8208;water interface. This is enabled by systematically changing bulk concentrations and suppression of fluoride dissolution.







Abstract
The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface&#8208;specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite&#8208;water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.

         <title>A Pyridine&#8208;Stabilized N&#8208;Phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboravinyl Cation: Boron Analogue of Vinyl Cation</title>

         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;diboravinyl cation was obtained through the displacement reaction of the bromide substituent on a diborene derivative using pyridine. This newly formed species was shown to be a boron analogue of the vinyl cation which could be used for the activation of small molecules.







Abstract
A boron analogue of vinyl cation, pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboravinyl cation 2+, was synthesized by displacement of bromide in diborene 1 with excess pyridine. Experimental and computational studies showed that the positive charge is mainly at the B&#8722;B skeleton with delocalization to the pyridine ligand. One of the main modes of reactivity is through the B=B double bond alongside activation of the pyridine substituent, where the Bpyridine center is the predominant nucleophilic center and the predominant electrophilic center is either the activated pyridine para position or the BNHC center, illustrating the presence of diborene cation A, borylene&#8208;borenium cation B and diborene&#8208;pyridinium cation C resonance structures in cation 2+.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Based Engineering of the Active Pocket of D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase Leading to Highly Improved Specificity toward D&#8208;Glufosinate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilicity&#8208;based triple&#8208;code site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (S&#8208;T&#8208;Q) was applied to the wild&#8208;type enzyme RgDAAO, leading to a mutant Zn7 with greater than 2000&#8208;fold improvement in specific activity toward the unnatural substrate D&#8208;glufosinate, which was converted into PPO, a precursor of an excellent herbicide, L&#8208;PPT. Computational analysis revealed that the higher activity was mainly caused by an extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity.







Abstract
Due to its stringent stereospecificity, D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has made it very easy to synthesize L&#8208;amino acids. However, the low activity of the wild&#8208;type enzyme toward unnatural substrates, such as D&#8208;glufosinate (D&#8208;PPT), restricts its application. In this study, DAAO from Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO) was directly evolved using a hydrophilicity&#8208;substitution saturation mutagenesis strategy, yielding a mutant with significantly increased catalytic activity against D&#8208;PPT. The mutant displays distinct catalytic properties toward hydrophilic substrates as compared to numerous WT&#8208;DAAOs. The analysis of homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation suggest that the extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity was the reason for the enhanced activity. The current study established an enzymatic synthetic route to L&#8208;PPT, an excellent herbicide, with high efficiency, and the proposed strategy provides a new viewpoint on enzyme engineering for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids.

         <title>Ynamide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Bond Formation: Mechanistic Study and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynamide coupling reagents combine the advantages of conventional active esters and coupling reagents, while overcoming their disadvantages, and exhibit superiority in addressing the notorious racemization/epimerization issue. The applicability of ynamide coupling reagents has been successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis on the basis of a systematic mechanistic study.







Abstract
Ynamides, a class of novel coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, facilitated peptide bond formation in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step manner with &#945;&#8208;acyloxyenamide active esters of amino acids as stable intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;Ynamide coupling reagents combine the advantages of conventional active esters and coupling reagents, while overcoming their disadvantages, and exhibit superiority in addressing the notorious racemization/epimerization issue. The applicability of ynamide coupling reagents has been successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head-to-tail cyclization, and solid-phase peptide synthesis on the basis of a systematic mechanistic study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ynamides, a class of novel coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, facilitated peptide bond formation in a one-pot, two-step manner with &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-acyloxyenamide active esters of amino acids as stable intermediates. Ynamide-mediated peptide synthesis proceeded by a reaction mechanism that is completely different from that of conventional coupling reagents and exhibited superiority in addressing the issue of racemization/epimerization during peptide bond formation. Herein, we present a systematic mechanistic analysis, including kinetics and Br&#248;nsted-type structure&#8211;reactivity studies and density functional theory calculations, providing unprecedented mechanistic insight into ynamide-mediated peptide bond formation. Based on these mechanistic studies, significant improvements were made, and the applicability of ynamide-mediated peptide bond formation was successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head-to-tail cyclization and solid-phase peptide synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Peapod&#8208;like Micrometer Tubes from a Planet&#8208;Satellite&#8208;type Supramolecular Megamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type amphiphilic supramolecular megamer is presented. It exhibits an unprecedented hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process in aqueous solution. The self&#8208;assembled structures formed by the megamer evolve from vesicles to vesosomes and eventually to a peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tubes as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside it as the peas.







Abstract
This study presents interesting self&#8208;assembly of peapod&#8208;like micrometer tubes from a planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type supramolecular megamer, which was constructed through the specific host&#8211;guest molecular recognition between azobenzene (AZO)&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly(ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol)&#8208;star&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (HSP&#8208;AZO) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin(CD)&#8208;based hydrophilic hyperbranched polyglycerol (CD&#8208;g&#8208;HPG). A peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tube as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside as the peas was formed through sequential vesicle entosis, linear association, and fusion processes. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations support the structural possibility of the supramolecular peapod formation and its mechanism. UV light irradiation could lead to the disassembly of the peapod&#8208;like structure. This study expands the family of supramolecular polymers and opens a new avenue to develop bioinspired complex hierarchical nanoarchitectures at the microscopic level.

         <title>Amorphous Aluminosilicate Nanosheets as Universal Precursors for the Synthesis of Diverse Zeolite Nanosheets for Polymer&#8208;Cracking Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method allows zeolite nanosheets (NSs) to be prepared from single&#8208;species amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs). The AAS&#8208;NSs were prepared by the two&#8208;dimensional reactor in amphiphilic phases (TRAP) method. Using this approach four zeolite types were prepared from single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs by the dry gel conversion (DGC) process with structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs).







Abstract
Zeolites catalyze some reactions in their molecular&#8208;sized pores, but large molecules can react only on their external surface. Zeolite&#8208;nanosheets (NSs) have been developed as catalysts for large molecules. The previously reported methods to synthesize zeolite&#8208;NSs are specialized for each zeolite type. Here we propose a new method to synthesize various zeolite&#8208;NSs from the same amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs) as a universal precursor. We successfully synthesized the unprecedented AAS&#8208;NSs in the hydrophilic space of the stable hyperswollen lyotropic lamellar (HL) phase. The four zeolite types could be obtained from the single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs. These results imply that this method enables us to synthesize almost all types of zeolite&#8208;NSs. Moreover, the synthesized CHA&#8208;NSs have great potential for various applications because of their thickness and large external surface area.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Properties of Cryptophazane&#8212;A Soluble and Functionalizable C1&#8208;Symmetrical Cryptophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptophanes are molecular hosts of particular interest for the development of biosensors based on xenon magnetic resonance imaging as they bind xenon reversibly. To prepare such a biosensor, a reactive site on the cryptophane core, which is desirable for such applications but synthetically challenging, has now been introduced by replacing a crown methylene bridge by a nitrogen atom to form a cryptophazane.







Abstract
The first example of a cryptophazane, a cryptophane functionalized with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the methylene bridges, is obtained with a 28&#8201;% overall yield over 8 steps, through the preparation of a C1&#8208;symmetrical aza&#8208;cyclotriveratrylene (aza&#8208;CTV). Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of a nitrogen atom on this part of the cryptophane core enhances the solubility in organic media of both the cryptophane and the synthetic intermediates, while presenting the same conformation as known cryptophanes. Cryptophazane was prepared on a multigram scale and easily functionalized. We also investigated its ability to encapsulate xenon atoms using hyperpolarized 129Xe (HP 129Xe) NMR spectroscopy. We found that both its affinity and exchange kinetics were in the appropriate range for applications in 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combined with the wide range of possible functionalization, this makes cryptophazane an excellent candidate for targeted HP 129Xe MRI.

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spectral tuning&#8212;from green to red&#8212;of luciferase&#8208;free luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was demonstrated by means of electrolyte engineering. The color change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and brings evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state by double layer electric fields. Visual mapping of ECL and fluorescence fronts enables the optical quantitation of superoxide and oxyluciferin diffusivities.







Abstract
Luciferin is one of Nature's most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to promote firefly's luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst&#8212;luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin's electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.

         <title>Full Control of the Chiral Overpass Effect in Helical Polymers: P/M Screw Sense Induction by Remote Chiral Centers After Bypassing the First Chiral Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical sense induction in polymers is usually commanded by the chiral residue directly attached to the polymer backbone. In this work, it is demonstrated that either a P or M helical sense can be induced into a poly(phenylacetylene) by activation of a chiral overpass effect followed by selective manipulation of the conformational composition at a remote chiral center.







Abstract
In helical polymers, helical sense induction is usually commanded by teleinduction mechanism, where the largest substituent of the chiral residue directly attached to the main chain is the one that commands the helical sense. In this work, different helical structures with different helical senses are induced in a helical polymer [poly&#8208;(phenylacetylene)] when the conformational composition of two different dihedral angles of a pendant group with more than two chiral residues is tamed. Thus, while the dihedral angle at chiral residue 1 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;alanine], attached to the backbone, produces an extended or bent conformation in the pendant resulting in two scaffolds with different stretching degree, the second dihedral angle at chiral residue 2 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;methoxyphenylacetamide] places the substituents of this chiral center in a different spatial orientation, originating opposite helical senses at the polymer that are induced through a total control of the &#8220;chiral overpass effect&#8221;.

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling multiphase coacervate droplets to a chemical reaction cycle allows access to regimes inside the phase diagram not possible under thermodynamic control. Control over the stability, liquidity, and localization of the multiphases makes it a great synthetic platform to study the organization of membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.

         <title>Spatial Well&#8208;defined Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers with Single&#8208;Layer Thickness for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites, and monolayer characteristic of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction catalysts can decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The experimental and density functional theory simulation show that the relative position and local coordination environment have a significant effect on the cooperation between the metal centers.







Abstract
Innovative bimetallic materials provide more possibilities for further improving the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts because there is not a practical way to decouple the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hindering in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19&#8197;s&#8722;1 was achieved at the overpotential of 500&#8197;mV.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms. This oligo&#8208;A&#8208;based surface chemistry engineering method will enable controllable diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the nanoscopic surface to develop single&#8208;nanoparticle plasmonic devices for extreme nanophotonics and polariton chemistry.







Abstract
Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#177;3.6&#176; to 125.3&#177;8.0&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme Substrate Scope Complementarity for Promiscuous Cascade Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades can be used for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. A substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach was implemented to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase and a decarboxylase. The matched substrate scope of the enzymes was leveraged to produce a variety of enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are uniquely powerful for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. However, high substrate specificity can hinder the scope of biocatalytic cascades because the constituent enzymes may have non&#8208;complementary activity. In this study, we implemented a substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase (ObiH) and a decarboxylase for the production of chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. To generate a promiscuous cascade, we engineered a tryptophan decarboxylase to act efficiently on &#946;&#8208;OH amino acids while avoiding activity on l&#8208;threonine, which is needed for ObiH activity. We leveraged this exquisite selectivity with matched substrate scope to produce a variety of enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides. This demonstration shows how SUMS can be used to guide the development of promiscuous, C&#8722;C bond forming cascades.

         <title>An Unsaturated Bond Strategy to Regulate Active Centers of Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to modulate the charge distribution of active centers of organic catalysts by using unsaturated bonds (UBs) is reported. The UBs can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N group as active centers. The effect of UBs decoration on adsorption property of the catalysts is disclosed.







Abstract
Unsaturated environment is the key to affect catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unveiling the effect of unsaturated sites toward ORR activity is of importance due to the vague unsaturated states. Reported here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy on the evaluation of unsaturated bonds (UBs) on adjacent carbon environment by precisely developing two metal&#8208;free vinyl&#8208;/azo&#8208;decorated covalent organic frameworks (Vinyl&#8208;COF and Azo&#8208;COF) as catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared UB&#8208;COFs exhibit good performance than the control Py&#8208;COF and comparable to the most reported carbon catalysts. Supported by theory calculations and in situ Raman spectra&#8208;electrochemistry, it is revealed that the UBs in organic catalysts can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N groups as active centers. Importantly, the intrinsic UBs can induce local charge redistribution, and make the molecular skeleton possess high isosurface map distribution, with an efficient affinity for oxygen intermediates.

         <title>19F Barcoding Enables Multiplex Detection of Biomarkers Associated with Organ Injury and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of molecular sensors with 19F barcodes enables multiplex detection of different biomarkers associated with organ injury and cancer. The barcoding strategy takes the advantage of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output and multiplex capacity.







Abstract
Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in complex environments is critical for the in&#8208;depth exploration of different biological processes, which is challenging for many current analytical methods due to various limitations. Herein, we report a strategy of 19F barcoding which takes the advantages of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output, and multiplex capacity. A set of 19F&#8208;barcoded sensors responding to different biomarkers involved in organ injury and cancer are designed, synthesized, and characterized. With these sensors, we accomplish concurrent assessment of different biomarkers in the samples collected from the mice with drug&#8208;induced liver/kidney injury or tumor, illustrating the feasibility of this approach for multiplexed detection of different biomarkers in complex environments during various biological processes.

         <title>Algorithmic Explorations of Unimolecular and Bimolecular Reaction Spaces
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;low cost reaction exploration algorithm (Yet Another Reaction Program, v2.0) is used to predict reaction outcomes and characterize multiple unimolecular and bimolecular reaction networks. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.







Abstract
Algorithmic reaction exploration based on transition state searches has already made inroads into many niche applications, but its potential as a general&#8208;purpose tool is still largely unrealized. Computational cost and the absence of benchmark problems involving larger molecules remain obstacles to further progress. Here an ultra&#8208;low cost exploration algorithm is implemented and used to explore the reactivity of unimolecular and bimolecular reactants, comprising a total of 581 reactions involving 51 distinct reactants. The algorithm discovers all established reaction pathways, where such comparisons are possible, while also revealing a much richer reactivity landscape, including lower barrier reaction pathways and a strong dependence of reaction conformation in the apparent barriers of the reported reactions. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy of hydrated proton complexes in solution provides compelling evidence of the pronounced impact on the electronic structure of the water molecules participating in the hydration, with a hierarchy in coupling strengths of the proton with profoundly strong orbital interactions for the inner three water molecules, and Coulombic field effects of the proton positive charge with the first hydration shell water molecules.







Abstract
Seemingly simple yet surprisingly difficult to probe, excess protons in water constitute complex quantum objects with strong interactions with the extended and dynamically changing hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of the liquid. Proton hydration plays pivotal roles in energy transport in hydrogen fuel cells and signal transduction in transmembrane proteins. While geometries and stoichiometry have been widely addressed in both experiment and theory, the electronic structure of these specific hydrated proton complexes has remained elusive. Here we show, layer by layer, how utilizing novel flatjet technology for accurate x&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements and combining infrared spectral analysis and calculations, we find orbital&#8208;specific markers that distinguish two main electronic&#8208;structure effects: Local orbital interactions determine covalent bonding between the proton and neigbouring water molecules, while orbital&#8208;energy shifts measure the strength of the extended electric field of the proton.

         <title>Tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane: An Isolable, Halogen&#8208;Free, Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottleable, halogen&#8208;free, neutral, single&#8208;site Lewis superacid, tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3) is synthesized in one pot from commercially available materials and its properties investigated. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane along with its lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO induces the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic C&#8722;F bond functionalizations indicate that BoCb3 is a promising Lewis acid catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3), a single site neutral Lewis superacid, in one pot from commercially available materials is achieved. The high fluoride ion affinity (FIA) confirms its classification as a Lewis superacid and the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method as well as adducts with Lewis bases indicate stronger Lewis acidity over the widely used fluorinated aryl boranes. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane and lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO rationalize the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic studies indicate that BoCb3 is a superior catalyst for promoting C&#8722;F bond functionalization reactions than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].

         <title>Cooperative Catalyst&#8208;Enabled Regio&#8208; and Stereodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Aldimine Esters with Racemic Allylic Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of aldimine esters with racemic allylic alcohols was enabled by cooperative catalysis. The Et3B additive plays a significant role in ionizing allylic alcohols to form electrophilic metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species and simultaneously promotes the formation of nucleophilic Cu&#8208;ylides. Computational mechanistic studies revealed the role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities.







Abstract
We describe cooperative bimetallic catalysis that enables regio&#8208;/stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylations of aldimine esters. By employing Et3B as the key activator, racemic allylic alcohols can be directly ionized to form Pd or Ir&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species in the presence of achiral Pd or chiral Ir complexes, respectively. The less or more substituted allylic termini of the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species are amenable to nucleophilic attack by the chiral Cu&#8208;azomethine ylide, the formation of which is simultaneously facilitated by Et3B, affording &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high regioselectivity and excellent stereoselectivity. The use of readily available allylic alcohols as electrophilic precursors represents an improvement from an environmental and atom/step economy perspective. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.

         <title>Facilitating Molecular Activation and Proton Feeding by Dual Active Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;site synergism of vacant and protonated pyridine N in polymeric C3N4 significantly polarized the inert CO2 molecules and eliminates the formation energy barrier of key *COOH intermediates, inducing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity enhancement (183 times) in CO production. Our atomic&#8208;precision strategy offers a promising way to overcome the technical challenges in molecular activation and rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer during CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 provides an appealing way to alleviate the energy crisis and manage the global carbon balance but is limited by the high activation energy and the rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer. We now develop a dual&#8208;site strategy for high&#8208;efficiency CO2 conversion through polarizing CO2 molecules at pyridine N vacancies and accelerating the intermediate protonation by protonated pyridine N adjacent to nitrogen vacancies on polymeric carbon nitride. Our photocatalysts with atomic&#8208;level engineered active sites manifest a high CO production rate of 1835&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 183 times higher than the pristine bulk carbon nitride. Theoretical prediction and experimental studies confirm that such excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between vacant and protonated pyridine N in decreasing the formation energy of the key *COOH intermediates and the efficient electron transfer relay facilitated by the defect&#8208;induced shallow trap state and homogeneous charge mediators.

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion Along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF) is insensitive to the pathway followed, the co&#8208;assembly of LPF with naphthylamine derivatives is pathway&#8208;dependent. The helical nanofibers of LPF transform into diverse kinetically trapped chiral structures with opposite chirality through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway (pathway B), while only thermodynamically stable nonhelical structures are formed by the thermodynamic pathway (pathway&#8197;A).







Abstract
Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand biological processes, but still remains a challenge to realize in artificial systems. Herein, helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained by a thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide an approach to explore chirality inversion accompanied by morphology transition by manipulating the kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.

         <title>Narrowband Emissive TADF Conjugated Polymers towards Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emissions are developed by attaching multiple resonance emitting moieties as pendants onto the polycarbazole backbone, and the resulting OLEDs achieve a maximum EQE of 17.5&#8201;% with FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) conjugated polymers usually show broad emission spectra due to the large structure relaxation, which is not desirable for high&#8208;quality organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. Herein, through attaching multiple resonance (MR) induced emitting moiety as pendant onto the polycarbazole backbone, TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emission are demonstrated. The obtained conjugated polymers exhibit typical TADF characteristics with narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 33&#8211;43&#8197;nm. The solution&#8208;processed devices employing these polymers as emissive layers realize excellent performances with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.5&#8201;%, emission peak at 496&#8197;nm and FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Asymmetric Cyclization of Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Substituted 1,6&#8208;Enynes for the Synthesis of Seletracetam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes with boronic acids is achieved triggered by C(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation, which provides an expedient access to 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkably high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing groups into organic molecules can significantly affect their physical and chemical properties and has long been used as an effective strategy for drug discovery and development. Consequently, the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles is highly desirable and sought after. Herein, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes, providing an expedient access to synthetically attractive 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkable high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee,&gt;35 examples). This protocol features readily available starting materials and excellent functional group compatibility, and exhibits complementary regioselectivity. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.

         <title>Highly Selective Preparation and Depolymerization of Chemically Recyclable Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metal&#8208;free access to poly(cyclopentene carbonate) and its chemical recycling to monomer were achieved by using a dinuclear bifunctional organoboron catalyst, enriching the portfolio of the circular plastic economy.







Abstract
Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC) produced by copolymerization of CO2 and cyclopentene oxide (CPO) is a promising but challenging chemical recyclable polymer that has high potential in minimizing plastic pollution and maximizing CO2 utilization. Currently, problems remain to be solved, include low reactivity of toxic metal catalysts, inevitable byproducts, and especially the ambiguous mechanism understanding. Herein, we present the first metal&#8208;free access to PCPC by using a series of modular dinuclear organoboron catalysts. PCPC was afforded in an unprecedented catalytic efficiency of 1.0&#8197;kg of PCPC/g of catalyst; while the depolymerization of PCPC abides by a combination pathway of random chain scission and chain unzipping, returning CPO in near&#8208;quantitative yield (&gt;99&#8201;%). The preparation and depolymerization of PCPC along with in depth understanding of related mechanisms would be helpful for further development of advanced catalysts and recyclable plastics.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Economic Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic cascade catalysis consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been created for the high&#8208;throughput RAFT synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight polymers, under benchtop conditions at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) polymers by green approaches is highly desirable but remains unexplored. We report the creation of an atom&#8208;economic enzymatic cascade catalysis, consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), that enables high&#8208;throughput reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) synthesis of UHMW polymers at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L. FOx transforms formic acid, a C1 substrate, and oxygen to CO2 and H2O2, respectively. CO2 can escape from solution while H2O2 is harnessed in situ by HRP to generate radicals from acetylacetone for RAFT polymerization, leaving no waste accumulation in solution. Oxygen&#8208;tolerant RAFT polymerization using enzymatic cascade redox cycles was successfully performed in vials and 96&#8208;well plates to produce libraries of well&#8208;defined UHMW polymers, and represents the first example of high&#8208;throughput synthesis method of such materials at extremely low volumes.

         <title>Comprehensive Fragment Screening of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Proteome Explores Novel Chemical Space for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a fragment&#8208;based screening strategy by NMR, we identified 311 small molecule binders of 25 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteins, thus expanding the previously unexplored chemical and target space. Further, using experimental and bioinformatic analysis we identify potential binding sites. This comprehensive data would greatly assist medicinal chemistry efforts even beyond COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (SCoV2) and its variants of concern pose serious challenges to the public health. The variants increased challenges to vaccines, thus necessitating for development of new intervention strategies including anti&#8208;virals. Within the international Covid19&#8208;NMR consortium, we have identified binders targeting the RNA genome of SCoV2. We established protocols for the production and NMR characterization of more than 80&#8201;% of all SCoV2 proteins. Here, we performed an NMR screening using a fragment library for binding to 25 SCoV2 proteins and identified hits also against previously unexplored SCoV2 proteins. Computational mapping was used to predict binding sites and identify functional moieties (chemotypes) of the ligands occupying these pockets. Striking consensus was observed between NMR&#8208;detected binding sites of the main protease and the computational procedure. Our investigation provides novel structural and chemical space for structure&#8208;based drug design against the SCoV2 proteome.

We report a new class of trimethine skeleton NIR&#8208;II fluorophores (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) with improved stability over traditional heptamethine NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and emission above 1000&#8197;nm. The NIR&#8208;II Cy3s can reversibly respond to HClO and reactive sulfur species (RSS) and can serve as an effective platform for the reversible monitoring of the HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox process in a pathophysiology environment. Finally, we applied NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 to the reversible assessment of the redox environment and dynamic effect of drug treatment in an acute inflammation model and of redox potential changes during liver injury and repair.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent imaging shows great potential for deep tissue analysis at high resolution in living body owing to low background autofluorescence and photon scattering. However, reversible monitoring of redox homeostasis using NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate probes. In this study, a series of stable and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II dyes (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) were constructed based on trimethine skeleton. Significantly, introducing the 1,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;decahydroquinoxaline group to the NIR&#8208;II Cy3s not only effectively increased the wavelength, but also served as an effective response site for HClO, which can be restored by reactive sulfur species (RSS). Based on this, NIR&#8208;II Cy3s were used for reversible monitoring of HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox processes in the pathophysiology environment. Finally, NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 was successfully utilized for assessment of the redox environments and drug treatment effects in acute inflammation model.

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol&#8208;based Ultrathin Microporous Nanofilms for Highly Efficient Molecular Sieving Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin microporous polymer composite membranes with extraordinary perm&#8208;selectivity for organic solvent nanofiltration were fabricated by employing two novel 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives as IP monomers. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Moreover, it can achieve precise separation of organic molecules with similar molecular weights on their charge and molecular size.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is an emerging membrane separation technology, which urgently requires robust, easily processed, OSN membranes possessing high permeance and small solutes&#8208;selectivity to facilitate enhanced industrial uptake. Herein, we describe the use of two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives to fabricate hyper&#8208;crosslinked, microporous polymer nanofilms through IP. Ultra&#8208;thin, defect&#8208;free polyesteramide/polyester nanofilms (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) could be obtained readily due to the relatively large molecular size and ionized nature of the BIPOL monomers retarding the rate of the IP. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Specifically, the amino&#8208;BIPOL/PAN membrane exhibits extraordinary permselectivity performances with molecular weight cut&#8208;off as low as 233&#8197;Da and MeOH permeance of &#8776;13&#8197;LMH/bar. Precise separation of small dye mixtures with similar M.W. based on both their charge and molecular size are achieved.

         <title>Precise Control of Selenium Functionalization in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two region&#8208;specific selenium&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors flanking conjugated side chains are compared with their sulfur&#8208;based analogue. mPh4F&#8208;TS with selenium at the outer positions show the most rigid skeleton, red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS organic solar cells exhibit the lowest energetic disorders, the highest charge carrier mobility and the best photon response, affording a top&#8208;ranking efficiency of &gt;18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Central &#960;&#8208;core engineering of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) is effective in boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Especially, selenium (Se) functionalization of NF&#8208;SMAs is considered a promising strategy but the structure&#8208;performance relationship remains unclear. Here, we synthesize two isomeric alkylphenyl&#8208;substituted selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs named mPh4F&#8208;TS and mPh4F&#8208;ST with different substitution positions, and contrast them with the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based analogue, mPh4F&#8208;TT. When placing Se atoms at the outer positions of the &#960;&#8208;core, mPh4F&#8208;TS shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact molecular stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS devices exhibit excellent absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS achieves more balanced photovoltaic parameters and yields an efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%, which highlights that precisely manipulating selenium functionalization is a practicable way toward high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H Hydroxylation in Diiron &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylase CmlA Transpires by Amine&#8208;Assisted O2 Activation Avoiding FeIV2O2 Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM modeling revealed that the C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of L&#8208;PAPA in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires unprecedentedly through a traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation pathway. This novel O2 activation mode modulated by the L&#8208;PAPA substrate, which is associated with the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding, opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities in O2 activation by non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.







Abstract
Through QM/MM modeling, we discovered that C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires by traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation. Different from the canonical diiron hydroxylase sMMO, this aliphatic&#8208;amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation avoids generating the high&#8208;valent diferryl FeIV2O2 species, but alternatively renders a diferric FeIII2O species as the reactive oxidant. From this unprecedented O2 activation mode, the derived C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation mechanism in CmlA also differs drastically from the toluene aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase T4MO. This substrate&#8208;modulated O2 activation in CmlA has rich mechanistic implications for other diiron hydroxylases with an amine group adjacent to the C&#8722;H bond under hydroxylation in substrates, such as hDOHH. Furthermore, the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding in CmlA opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities for O2 activation in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.

         <title>Reversible Light&#8208;Controlled CO Adsorption via Tuning &#960;&#8208;Complexation of Cu+ Sites in Azobenzene&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart adsorbents are fabricated by introducing Cu+ into azobenzene&#8208;decorated metal&#8208;organic frameworks, in which azobenzene acts as light&#8208;responsive motifs and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexing sites. Ultraviolet&#8208;/visible&#8208;light irradiation triggers the isomerization of azobenzene, causing the changes in electrostatic potential around Cu+.

Light&#8208;responsive adsorbents capture significant attention due to their tailorable performance upon light irradiation. The modulation of such adsorbents is mainly based on weak (physical) interactions caused by steric hindrance while tuning strong interaction with target adsorbates is scarce. Here we report smart &#960;&#8208;complexation adsorbents, which can adjust the &#960;&#8208;complexation of active sites via light irradiation. A typical metal&#8208;organic framework, MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2, was decorated with azobenzene motifs, and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexation active sites were introduced subsequently. The reversible light&#8208;induced isomerization of azobenzene regulates the surface electrostatic potentials around Cu+ from &#8722;0.038 to 0.008&#8197;eV, causing shielding and exposure effects. The alteration of CO uptake is achieved up to 54&#8201;% via changing light, while that on MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 is negligible. This study provides a clue for designing target&#8208;specific smart materials to meet the practical stimuli&#8208;responsive adsorption demands.

&lt;p&gt;Smart adsorbents are fabricated by introducing Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into azobenzene-decorated metal-organic frameworks, in which azobenzene acts as light-responsive motifs and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as &#960;-complexing sites. Ultraviolet-/visible-light irradiation triggers the isomerization of azobenzene, causing the changes in electrostatic potential around Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>A Universal Photoactivatable Tag Attached to Fluorophores Enables Their Use for Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general strategy for constructing photoactivatable probes by introducing a universal tag SO on fluorescent molecules. This strategy is applicable to most of the commercial fluorophores with various skeletal structures. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubules in fixed neurons.







Abstract
Single molecule localization microscopy based on photoactivation is a powerful tool for investigating the ultrastructure of cells. We developed a general strategy for photoactivatable fluorophores, using 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxathiine group (SO) as a tag to attach to various skeletal structures, including coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, and cyanine. The conjugation of SO resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence due to photoinduced electron transfer (PeT). Under the irradiation of excitation light, singlet oxygen generated by the fluorophores converted the SO moiety into its ester derivative, terminated the PeT process, and restored the fluorescence. Single molecule localization imaging was achieved using a dual functional illuminating beam in the visible, acting as both the activating and the exciting source. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubule structures in neurons.

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive nickel catalysis was leveraged to orchestrate the multicomponent union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and isobutyl chloroformate to assemble C&#8208;acyl glycosides in high anomeric selectivities. Computational studies provided insights that rationalize the origin of the high chemoselectivity. The method is applicable to the synthesis of complex C&#8208;linked disaccharides and late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of peptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated in situ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8722;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize C&#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Assembly of MOFs Colloidosomes for Bubble&#8208;Propelled Micromotors and Stirring&#8208;Free Environmental Remediation</title>

         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward strategy is designed to efficiently self&#8208;assemble MOF nanoparticles into robust MOFtors based on the Pickering emulsion. Such MOFtors are capable of enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring.







Abstract
The design of MOF&#8208;based micromotors (MOFtors) is still challenging and with limited approaches, especially for the MOF nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we report a universal and straightforward strategy to efficiently self&#8208;assembly MOF NPs into robust MOFtors for enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring. Based on the transient Pickering emulsion method, Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Fe&#8208;UiO) NPs are rapidly self&#8208;assembled into Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 colloidosomes (Fe&#8208;UiOSomes) on a large scale, and the formation mechanism is systematically studied. The Fe&#8208;UiOSomes&#8208;Pt micromotors through chemical reduction (Micromotor&#8208;C) presented a higher motility of 450&#177;180&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a 5&#8197;wt% H2O2 aqueous solution. Finally, the bubble&#8208;propelled Micromotor&#8208;C was employed to efficiently remove dyes and heavy metal ions (94&#8201;% for MO and 91&#8201;% for CrVI).

         <title>Thiolated, Reduced Palladium Nanoclusters with Resolved Structures for the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first atomically monodisperse thiolated Pd nanocluster is obtained. It has a +6 charged di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged &#956;&#8208;6 interstitial B atom. The as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and the commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Although thiolated, reduced Group 11 metal nanoclusters with atomic monodispersity have been repeatedly reported in the past decade, their Pd analogues have not been reported thus far. In this work, we provide a resolution for the challenging synthesis and obtain for the first time an atomically monodisperse thiolated, reduced Pd (q=+0.75) nanocluster with a di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged interstitial B atom, as revealed by ESI&#8208;MS, SCXRD, etc. &#956;&#8208;6 B is found for the first time in Group 10 and 11 metal nanoclusters. More importantly, the as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and even a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), having significant implications for the influence of the metal charge state and space structure on the catalytic activity.

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions
</title>

         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions without exogenous photocatalysts were realized using a nickel catalyst that was activated through intraligand charge transfer. Ligand polymerization afforded a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.







Abstract
We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;coupling reactions follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.

         <title>Regioisomer&#8208;Free Difluoro&#8208;Monochloro Terminal&#8208;based Hexa&#8208;Halogenated Acceptor with Optimized Crystal Packing for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
New fluorine/chlorine regio&#8208;regular hetero&#8208;trihalogenated terminal was firstly synthesized and systematically employed to enhance single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance of the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.65&#8201;%, which is far better than that of Y&#8208;Cl and Y&#8208;FCl and is the highest efficiency for the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs.







Abstract
Herein, we synthesized new hetero&#8208;halogenated end groups with well&#8208;determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (o&#8208;FCl&#8208;IC and FClF&#8208;IC), and synthesized regioisomer&#8208;free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y&#8208;Cl, Y&#8208;FCl, and Y&#8208;FClF with distinct hetero&#8208;halogenated terminals, respectively. The single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y&#8208;FClF exhibits more compact three&#8208;dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y&#8208;FCl. From Y&#8208;Cl to Y&#8208;FCl to Y&#8208;FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical band gap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65&#8201;%, outperforming the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FCl and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero&#8208;halogens&#8208;based SMAs in binary OSCs. Our results demonstrate that difluoro&#8208;monochloro hetero&#8208;terminal is a superior regio&#8208;regular unit for enhancing the intermolecular crystal packing and photovoltaic performance of hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase&#8221;

Abstract
Soellner published on the interplay between allosteric and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;competitive inhibitors of ABL kinase, showing that the latter preferably binds to different conformational states of ABL compared to allosteric agents that specifically target the ABL myristate pocket (STAMP) and deducing that asciminib cannot bind to ABL simultaneously with ATP&#8208;competitive drugs. These results are to some extent in line with ours, although our analyses of dose&#8211;response matrices from combinations of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, show neither synergy nor antagonism, but suggest additive antiproliferative effects on BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent KCL22 cells. Furthermore, our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that asciminib can bind ABL concomitantly with type&#8208;1 or &#8208;2 ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors to form ternary complexes. Concomitant binding of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib might translate to benefit some chronic myeloid leukaemia patients.

Abstract
Manley and co&#8208;workers provide data demonstrating that, at super&#8208;pharmacological concentrations (300&#8197;&#956;M), a ternary complex between Abl, asciminib, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors is possible. The work in our manuscript concerns the interplay of asciminib (and GNF&#8208;2) with ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Cmax=1.6&#8211;3.7&#8197;&#956;M for asciminib). Manley and co&#8208;workers do not question any of the studies that we reported, nor do they provide explanations for how our work fits into their preferred model. Herein, we consider the data presented by Manley and co&#8208;workers. In addition, we provide new data supporting the findings in our Communication. Asciminib and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors do not simultaneously bind Abl at pharmacologically relevant concentrations unless the conformation selectivity for both ligands is matched.

How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X&#8208;ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8211;&#8211;layer by layer&#8211;&#8211;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H7O3+ core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton's positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk&#8208;like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J. Nibbering, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211066).

Thermoresponsive polymers undergo phase separation in response to changes in temperature. In their Communication (e202209530), Simon Harrisson, Colin Bonduelle, and co&#8208;workers present the use of synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibiting temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometers.

Spectral tuning , from green to red, of luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is achieved by electrolyte engineering, demonstrating that this does not require a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter. Visual mapping of luciferin's ECL enables a straightforward optical measurement of superoxide diffusivity, as described by Michelle&#8197;L. Coote, Marco Garavelli, Simone Ciampi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202209670).

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes recent advances regarding the preparation of complex and stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules by routes originating from purchasable or readily accessible alkenyl and allylic fluorides. The untapped potential of other, far less explored, commercially available organofluorine compounds as launching points for the development of stereoselective processes that may be valuable to drug discovery is underscored.







Abstract
Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One approach entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8722;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF3 or CF2H), and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.

         <title>Green Carbon Science: Keeping the Pace in Practice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts to deepen the understanding of sustainable development have resulted in the concept of green carbon science. In this Review, technological achievements in green carbon science are discussed, with a focus on pilot testing, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.







Abstract
The concept of green carbon science is to promote the goal of achieving carbon neutrality, the importance and urgency of which have been well&#8208;recognized and received worldwide attention. Carbon neutrality has become the focus of research work in many fields, and correspondingly, a growing number of papers and publications have been published over the last few years. However, since carbon neutralization is a real problem that urgently requires technical solutions, the transition from fundamental research to practical applications must be accelerated. A number of research teams are bold in putting things into practice and blazing new trails. This Review summarizes the recent technological developments within the framework of green carbon science, focusing on conducted pilot tests, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in the Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>

This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the production of HCHO from CO2, including chemical catalysis (hydrogenation using H2 and hydroboration/hydrosilylation), photo/electrocatalysis, and biocatalysis (enzymatic reduction). From analysis of advantages and deficits of each methodology, we present viewpoints and potential strategies for optimizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion.







Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;dracocephalone A (1) and (&#177;)&#8208;dracocequinones A (4) and B (5). An initially&#8208;envisioned intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder strategy guided the evolution of a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization approach that allowed for access to the carbocyclic core of 1. Further advancement by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations and rearrangements allowed for conversion to 1, 4, and 5.







Abstract
Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;dracocephalone A (1) and (&#177;)&#8208;dracocequinones A (4) and B (5). The synthesis was initially envisioned as proceeding through an intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a strategy that eventually evolved into a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization. This highly diastereoselective transformation set the stage for trans&#8208;decalin formation and a late&#8208;stage Su&#225;rez oxidation that produced a [3.2.1] oxabicycle suited for conversion to 1. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated aromatization, followed by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations, allowed for rearrangement to a [2.2.2] oxabicycle poised for conversion to 4 and 5.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Exhaustive Reduction of Oxo&#8208;Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system involving titanium used for the exhaustive reduction of carboxylic acid derivatives to the corresponding methyl compounds is reported. The catalytic system also works with other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates while the products might be promising for bio&#8208;applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the in situ generated TiIII&#8722;H species was key for this transformation.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids and derivatives all the way to their corresponding methyl&#8208;compounds is very rare and still challenging for homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report an unprecedented and general catalytic exhaustive reduction of carboxylic functional group straightforwardly to a methyl group. This reaction was achieved using earth&#8208;abundant and readily available titanium as a catalyst. Our system has broad functional group tolerance and works for various other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the in situ&#8208;generated TiIII&#8722;H species was vital for this transformation.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Assisted Click&#8208;Chemistry for Proximity&#8208;Driven, Site&#8208;Specific Acetylation of Histones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a proximity&#8208;driven, lysine&#8208;specific acetylation approach to construct precisely acetylated histone proteins. The approach is facilitated by a click reagent equipped with an acetate group donor to acetylate a nearby lysine in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of histones are essential in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Among these modifications, lysine acetylation is one of the most established. Earlier studies relied on the use of chromatin containing heterogeneous mixtures of histones acetylated at multiple sites. Differentiating the individual contribution of single acetylation events towards chromatin regulation is thus of great relevance. However, it is difficult to access homogeneous samples of histones, with a single acetylation, in sufficient quantities for such studies. By engineering histone H3 with a cysteine in proximity of the lysine of interest, we demonstrate that conjugation with maleimide&#8208;DBCO followed by a strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction results in the acetylation of a single lysine in a controlled, site&#8208;specific manner. The chemical precision offered by our click&#8208;to&#8208;acetylate approach will facilitate access to and the study of acetylated histones.

         <title>Photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H Pyridination via Arene&#8211;Pyridinium Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leverage the photoexcitation of arene&#8211;pyridinium electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes to achieve C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination. Black light irradiation of the simple combination of arene substrate, pyridine, acid (to generate a pyridinium acceptor in situ), and O2 (terminal oxidant) affords N&#8208;arylpyridinium products. This transformation proceeds without an exogenous photocatalyst, complementing prior photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H amination methods.







Abstract
This report describes the development of a photochemical method for C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination that leverages the photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental and DFT studies show that black light (&#955;max&#8776;350&#8197;nm) irradiation of solutions of protonated pyridines (acceptors) and aromatic C&#8722;H substrates (donors) results in single electron transfer to form aryl radical cation intermediates that can be trapped with pyridine nucleophiles under aerobic conditions. With some modification of the reaction conditions, this EDA activation mode is also effective for promoting the oxidatively triggered SNAr pyridination of aryl halides. Overall, this report represents an inexpensive and atom&#8208;economical approach to photochemical pyridination reactions that eliminates the requirement of an exogenous photocatalyst.

&lt;p&gt;This report describes the development of a photochemical method for C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H pyridination that leverages the photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental and DFT studies show that black light (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;350&#8197;nm) irradiation of solutions of protonated pyridines (acceptors) and aromatic C&#8722;H substrates (donors) results in single electron transfer to form aryl radical cation intermediates that can be trapped with pyridine nucleophiles under aerobic conditions. With some modification of the reaction conditions, this EDA activation mode is also effective for promoting the oxidatively triggered S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar pyridination of aryl halides. Overall, this report represents an inexpensive and atom-economical approach to photochemical pyridination reactions that eliminates the requirement of an exogenous photocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts for Direct Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical composition of frustrated Lewis pairs is mapped to their performance in catalytic direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formate using linear scaling relationships. This map highlights the need for appropriately balancing the acidity and basicity of the components for enhanced activity, which led to the demonstration of hitherto unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.







Abstract
Despite recent progress in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), direct FLP&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 remains elusive. From a near&#8208;infinite array of plausible Lewis pairs, it is challenging to identify individual combinations that are appropriate for catalyzing this reaction. To this end, we propose a mapping of the chemical composition of FLPs to their activity towards direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into formate. The maps, built upon linear scaling relationships, pinpoint specific FLP combinations with the proper complementary acidity and basicity to optimally balance the energetics of the catalytic cycle. One such combination was experimentally validated to achieve hitherto unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.

         <title>Arylboration of Enecarbamates for the Synthesis of Borylated Saturated N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are important motifs found in many biologically active molecules. In this work, difunctionalization of 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered enecarbamates is achieved using both Cu/Pd and Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good selectivity. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Two catalytic systems have been developed for the arylboration of endocyclic enecarbamates to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. A Cu/Pd dual catalytic reaction enables the synthesis of borylated, &#945;&#8208;arylated azetidines, while a Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration reaction efficiently functionalizes 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered enecarbamates. In the case of the Cu/Pd&#8208;system, a remarkable additive effect was identified that allowed for broader scope. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable and Red&#8208;Emissive Radical Cation for Mutp53 Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive radical cation P.+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn was developed for mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of zinc ions to promote degradation of mutp53 in cancer cells via proteasome&#8208;dependent pathway and facilitate abrogation of various mutp53&#8208;conferred gain of function phenotypes.







Abstract
Compared with conventional closed&#8208;shell fluorophores, radical cations provide an opportunity for development of red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with small sizes and easy preparation. However, most radical cations reported in the literature suffer from poor stability in water solution and are almost non&#8208;emissive. To tackle this challenge, we herein develop a deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive and water&#8208;stable pyrrole radical cation P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn, which can be easily generated from P&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn by air oxidation. The deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn can be used for imaging&#8208;guided mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of Zn2+ into cancer cells to promote mutant p53 proteins degradation and abrogate mutp53&#8208;manifested gain of function, including reduced chemotherapy resistance, inhibited cancer cell migration, decreased tumor cell colony and sphere formation. The water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red emissive pyrrole radical cation is thus promising for cancer theranostic applications.

         <title>A Synthetic Cycle for Heteroarene Synthesis by Nitride Insertion
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>

An osmium nitride is shown to insert nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. A synthetic cycle to regenerate the starting nitride is presented alongside mechanistic studies of each step.







Abstract
Recent interest in skeletal editing necessitates the continued development of reagent classes with the ability to transfer single atoms. Terminal transition metal nitrides hold immense promise for single&#8208;atom transfer, though their use in organic synthesis has so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a synthetic cycle with associated detailed mechanistic studies that primes the development of terminal transition metal nitrides as valuable single&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Specifically, we show [cis&#8208;terpyOsNCl2]PF6 inserts nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. Mechanistic studies for each step (insertion, aromatization, product release, and nitride regeneration) are reported, including crystallographic characterization of diverted intermediates, kinetics, and computational studies. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Boroaminomethylation of Olefins to &#947;&#8208;Boryl Amines with CO as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as &#8722;CH2&#8208;source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond was described. In the present of CuCl and Xantphos as the catalyst, a variety of &#947;&#8208;boryl amines were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance. The new aromatization and other transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrate their utility. Notably, 13C labeled product was produced with isotope&#8208;labeled 13CO.







Abstract
Boroaminomethylation of olefins is an efficient process to convert hydrocarbons directly into boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Such chemicals are a good handle for obtaining more complexed amine derivatives through the various transformations of organoboron. However, using simple and easily available CO as the C1 feedstock to achieve boroaminomethylation is still elusive. Here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as the C1 source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond. This method affords valuable &#947;&#8208;boryl amines from four inexpensive readily chemicals. The wide synthetic transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrates their utility. Notably, 13C labeling studies revealed that the &#8722;CH2&#8208;building block was derived from one molecule of CO.

However, using simple and easily available CO as the C1 feedstock to achieve boroaminomethylation is still elusive. Here we report a copper-catalyzed boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as the C1 source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond. This method affords valuable &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-boryl amines from four inexpensive readily chemicals. The wide synthetic transformations of the &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-boryl amines demonstrates their utility. Notably, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeling studies revealed that the &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-building block was derived from one molecule of CO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Memory Effect in Thermoresponsive Proline&#8208;based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.







Abstract
We report that synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior is robust and governed by the chirality of the proline units. It paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as a simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Hydride&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes has been developed for rapid synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reaction is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild conditions, and having excellent functional group tolerance. Concise asymmetric synthesis of antidepressant drug, D&#8208;Milnacipran, was performed to demonstrate the synthetic usefulness.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulation&#8208;Guided Design of a Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Radiotherapy&#8208;Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
After demonstrating the potential of Th&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (nMOF) as excellent radiosensitizer with Monte Carlo simulations, we designed Th&#8208;DBP nMOF with Th6 secondary building units and DBP photosensitizers for efficient radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy. Th&#8208;DBP greatly enhanced hydroxyl radical and 1O2 generation upon irradiation to kill cancer cells and regress colon and pancreatic cancers in mice models.







Abstract
High&#8208;Z metal&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) with photosensitizing ligands can enhance radiation damage to tumors via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RT&#8208;RDT) process. Here we report Monte Carlo (MC) simulation&#8208;guided design of a Th&#8208;based nMOF built from Th6&#8208;oxo secondary building units and 5,15&#8208;di(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (DBP) ligands, Th&#8208;DBP, for enhanced RT&#8208;RDT. MC simulations revealed that the Th&#8208;lattice outperformed the Hf&#8208;lattice in radiation dose enhancement owing to its higher mass attenuation coefficient. Upon X&#8208;ray or &#947;&#8208;ray radiation, Th&#8208;DBP enhanced energy deposition, generated more reactive oxygen species, and induced significantly higher cytotoxicity to cancer cells over the previously reported Hf&#8208;DBP nMOF. With low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, Th&#8208;DBP suppressed tumor growth by 88&#8201;% in a colon cancer and 97&#8201;% in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell ZnO@Microporous Organic Polymer Nanospheres as Enhanced Piezo&#8208;Triboelectric Energy Harvesting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO core&#8208;triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP) shell nanoparticles showed enhanced small energy harvesting performance, compared with ZnO and MOP. The piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG) with the optimized 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% ZnO@MOP/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) film showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Core&#8208;shell nanospheres were prepared by the homogeneous coating of piezoelectric ZnO nanorod aggregates with triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP). The small energy harvesting performance of ZnO@MOP was significantly enhanced, compared with those of ZnO and MOP, due to the piezoelectrification&#8208;induced polarization of inner ZnO and the enhanced generation of tribopositive charges of MOP. Piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerators (PTENGs) fabricated with ZnO@MOP showed peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, the PTENGs showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles, demonstrating as efficient power sources for charging electrolytic capacitors and for operating 200 green light emitting diode bulbs.

After many years of being invoked as an intermediate, the existence of PhI(OTf)2 was recently disproven. Taking advantage of a nitro substituent that suppresses decomposition; an NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2 molecule has been synthesized and structurally characterized.







Abstract
PhI(OTf)2 and related ArI(OTf)2 species have been incorrectly invoked as intermediates in oxidation reactions for many years. We recently established that such compounds did not yet exist but remain an attractive target. Here we describe the synthesis, isolation, and structural characterization of NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2, which is resistant to decomposition and more reactive than PhI(OTf)(OAc), the species previously misidentified as PhI(OTf)2.

         <title>Perfectly Isotactic Polypropylene upon In Situ Activation of Ultrarigid meso Hafnocenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ activation, hafnocene meso&#8208;I yields isotactic polypropylene instead of atactic polypropylene of meso&#8208;I and rac&#8208;I. With our easy and convenient isomerization and polymerization protocol, productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers are accessible.







Abstract
For more than 40&#8197;years, the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric indenyl&#8208;based racemic metallocenes for the isoselective polymerization of propylene relied on a tedious separation of the produced rac and meso isomers. Status quo, latter are considered wasteful as they produce atactic polypropylene (aPP) rather than isotactic polypropylene (iPP) if activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Unexpectedly, the in situ activation of meso hafnocene I yielded perfectly isotactic polypropylene. We verified an isomerization of the meso compound to the corresponding racemic one upon triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) addition via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and established an easy and convenient polymerization protocol, enabling productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers. With this established isomerization protocol, the potential yield of iPP was enhanced by more than 400&#8201;%. This protocol was also shown to be applicable to other meso hafnocenes and some initial mechanistic insights were received.

         <title>A Topology&#8208;Defined Polyester Elastomer from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: A One&#8208;Pot&#8208;One&#8208;Step &#8220;Scrambling Polymerizations&#8221; Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is realized to produce polyester with tunable topologies by one&#8208;pot&#8208;one&#8208;step ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of a substituted &#948;&#8208;lactone derived from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;butadiene with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone mediated by sodium phenolate. The obtained transparent, non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable network presents great resilience and excellent elastic recovery properties for application as a polyester elastomer.







Abstract
It is significant and challenging to use CO2 to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO2&#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting in polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with a tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break of &gt;600&#8201;% can be used as an elastomer. We propose a method to provide polyester elastomers from CO2 and olefins for the first time, and expand the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed via catalytic transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer strategy. More importantly, this annulation represents a rare example of construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through tandem PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation process.







Abstract
Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization and Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of PdII&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.

         <title>Structure of the (Bi)carbonate Adlayer on Cu(100) Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular&#8208;scale structure of the interface between copper electrodes and bicarbonate electrolyte, a key system for electrochemical CO2 reduction, is clarified by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, revealing two highly complex coexisting adlayer structures above a critical potential. Ab initio calculations identify these as carbonate/water coadsorbate layers and indicate a strongly stabilizing effect of the adjacent liquid solution.







Abstract
(Bi)carbonate adsorption on Cu(100) in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 has been studied by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. Coexistence of different ordered adlayer phases with (
&#215;6
)R45&#176; and (4&#215;4) unit cells was observed in the double layer potential regime. The adlayer is rather dynamic and undergoes a reversible order&#8208;disorder phase transition at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional calculations indicate that the adlayer consists of coadsorbed carbonate and water molecules and is strongly stabilized by liquid water in the adjacent electrolyte.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Pyritide A2 through Pyridine Ring Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide pyritide A2 is reported. Inspired by biosynthesis, which proceeds through cycloaddition of post&#8208;translationally modified peptides, the described approach features rapid synthesis of a trisubstituted pyridine directly from a simple amino acid precursor.

Pyritides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide class of natural products that were recently genome&#8208;predicted and are structurally defined by unique pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycles. Inspired by their biosynthesis, proceeding through peptide modification and cycloaddition to form the heterocyclic core, we report the chemical synthesis of pyritide A2 involving pyridine ring synthesis from an amino acid precursor through aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. This strategy permitted the preparation of the decorated pyridine core with an appended amino acid residue in two steps from a commercially available arginine derivative and secured pyritide A2 in ten steps. Moreover, the synthetic logic enables efficient preparation of different pyridine subunits associated with pyritides, allowing rapid and convergent access to this new class of natural products and analogues thereof.

&lt;p&gt;The chemical synthesis of pyridine-containing macrocyclic peptide pyritide A2 is reported. Inspired by biosynthesis, which proceeds through cycloaddition of post-translationally modified peptides, the described approach features rapid synthesis of a trisubstituted pyridine directly from a simple amino acid precursor. This strategy proved general for the preparation of different pyridines associated with this class of natural products.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Observation of &#8220;Elongated&#8221; Conformational States in &#945;&#8208;Synuclein upon Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a modified cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive Pairing StatisticS), we unravel conformational changes of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein upon liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). The conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states in liquid droplets. During this early LLPS stage, &#945;&#8208;synuclein remains monomeric and highly flexible.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), fibrillation, and forms insoluble intracellular Lewy bodies in neurons, which are the hallmark of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Neurotoxicity precedes the formation of aggregates and might be related to &#945;&#8208;syn LLPS. The molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of LLPS are still elusive. To obtain structural insights into &#945;&#8208;syn upon LLPS, we take advantage of cross&#8208;linking/mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) and introduce an innovative approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive PAiring StatisticS). In this work, we show that the conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;syn shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states upon LLPS. We obtain insights into the critical initial stages of LLPS and establish a novel mass spectrometry&#8208;based approach that will aid to solve open questions in LLPS structural biology.

         <title>Electrochemical Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Carbonylation&#8208;Cyclization of Enallenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With electricity as green oxidant, a catalytic amount of benzoquinone (BQ) was used as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) in palladium&#8208;based electrocatalysis to provide highly efficient access to &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones skeletons in an undivided cell. This represents the first successful example of an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of allenes.







Abstract
Herein, we report an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation&#8208;carbocyclization of enallenols to afford &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones, which proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity. Interestingly, electrocatalysis was found to have an accelerating effect on the rate of the tandem process, leading to a more efficient reaction than that under chemical redox conditions.

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiTFSI&#8208;TMP&#8208;H2O electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stable window of 3.7&#8197;V are rationally designed by controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry. Benefiting from reduced H2O activity and reinforced solid electrolyte interphase, the assembled water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cell with a limited P/N ratio of 1.14 can achieve a long cycling life with high coulombic efficiency.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3.0&#8197;V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000&#8197;times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.

         <title>Structural Engineering toward Gold Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters are promising catalysts, and their molecular nature facilitates the design and controlled synthesis of cluster catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the strategies for constructing active sites and the effects of the ligands on cluster catalysis. The challenges and key future issues regarding catalytic applications of gold nanoclusters are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, and both the core and shell have significant effects on the catalytic properties. Thanks to their precise structures, the active metal site of the clusters can be readily identified and the effects of ligands on catalysis can be disclosed. In this Minireview, we summarize recent advances in catalytic research of gold nanoclusters, emphasizing four strategies for constructing open metal sites, including by post&#8208;treatment, the bulky ligands strategy, the surface geometric mismatch method, and heteroatom doping procedures. We also discuss the effects of ligands on the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of gold cluster catalysts. Finally, we present future challenges relating to gold cluster catalysis.

         <title>Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Responsive Polymeric Photocatalysts for Enhanced Control and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive photocatalytic materials have emerged that are not only able to efficiently catalyze reactions but can use external stimuli to modulate their physical properties. This technique has been used to control the reactivity of a photocatalytic material turning it on/off. Moreover, photocatalytic materials have been synthesized which can be easily recycled with the use of an external trigger.







Abstract
The emergence of heterogeneous photocatalysis has facilitated redox reactions with high efficiency, without compromising the recyclability of the photocatalyst. Recently, stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic materials have emerged as a powerful synthetic tool, with simple and rapid recovery, as well as an enhanced dynamic control over reactions. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are often inexpensive and easy to produce. They can be switched from an active &#8220;on&#8221; state to an inert &#8220;off&#8221; state in response to external stimuli, allowing the production of photocatalyst with adaptability, recyclability, and orthogonal control on different chemical reactions. Despite this versatility, the application of artificial smart material in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has not yet been maximized. In this Minireview, we will examine the recent developments of this emerging class of stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. We will discuss the synthesis route of appending photoactive components into different triggerable systems and, in particular, the controlled activation and recovery of the materials.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Learning Framework for the Automated Recognition of Molecules in Scanning&#8208;Probe&#8208;Microscopy Images</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a deep&#8208;learning framework to automatically analyse scanning&#8208;probe&#8208;microscopy data, which requires only a small number of image samples to achieve high accuracy. This work provides a strategy to accelerate data mining and the discovery of new materials.







Abstract
Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been achieved thanks to the development of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM). However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on human supervision. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R&#8208;CNN, to address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures. We employ the framework to determine two triangular&#8208;shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label their positions.

     alt="A Deep-Learning Framework for the Automated Recognition of Molecules in Scanning-Probe-Microscopy Images"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a deep-learning framework to automatically analyse scanning-probe-microscopy data, which requires only a small number of image samples to achieve high accuracy. This work provides a strategy to accelerate data mining and the discovery of new materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been achieved thanks to the development of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM). However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on human supervision. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R-CNN, to address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures. We employ the framework to determine two triangular-shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label their positions. We foresee that the application of computer vision in SPM images will become an indispensable part in the field, accelerating data mining and the discovery of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkably rapid CO2 reduction by solar light and water is achieved using molecular analogs of metal&#8208;oxide intercalated niobate nanosheets.







Abstract
Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion &#8220;fragments&#8221; of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8208;&#956;&#8208;O&#8208;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor &#8220;fragments&#8221; as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Outer&#8208;Shells for Sequentially Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, photocatalytic CO2&#8208;CO&#8208;CH4 conversion is realized by hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with hetero&#8208;shells. The enriched local CO concentration in inner shells and continuous protonation of CO on the outer&#8208;most shell enable the two&#8208;step tandem CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering hierarchical microreactors toward efficient tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Constructing delicate nano&#8208;/microreactors with tandem active sites in hierarchical architectures is a promising strategy for designing photocatalysts to realize the challenging but attractive CO2 reduction. Herein, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with spatial ordered hetero&#8208;shells are fabricated, which achieve two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. The multiple inner CeO2 shells increase the number of active catalytic sites to ensure efficient first&#8208;step reaction for generating CO, along with enriching the local CO concentration. The second&#8208;step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction is consequently induced by amorphous TiO2 (A&#8208;TiO2) composites on the adjacent outer&#8208;most shell, thus realizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion capability using one CeO2@CeO2/A&#8208;TiO2 HoMS. In&#8208;depth explorations in the microreactors provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering HoMS&#8208;based microreactors with temporally&#8211;spatially ordered shells toward efficient tandem catalysis.

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin polarization in CoSx loading on carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning method regulate LiPS conversion reaction. The external magnetic field induces electron spin polarization in CoSx, reducing electron repulsion, and enhancing the degree of 2p&#8211;3d orbital hybridization, thus accelerating the conversion ability of lithium polysulfides and enabling carbon nanofiber/CoSx/S cathodes with unprecedented performance and stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8722;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084&#8201;% per cycle decay rate at 2&#8197;C during 8150&#8197;cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.

         <title>Efficient Splitting of Alkane Isomers by a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Auxetic Reentrant Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy&#8208;efficient separation of alkane isomers for gasoline upgrading using Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with auxetic reentrant pore structures is reported by Dan Zhao et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211808). The honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows of the pore structure lead to a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and to high capacities for other isomers.

         <title>Hierarchical Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly: Fabrication and Visualization of Multiblock Microstructures
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent multiblock microcolumns are fabricated relying on the cooperation between the controllable host&#8208;guest complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and AIEgen guest and the hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on CB[8], NaBr and AIEgen guest. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly to be visualized, understood, and regulated.







Abstract
Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, bottom&#8208;up molecular strategies to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures are rare. Herein, we propose a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns containing 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and an AIEgen guest. Through the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guests (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of the sodium cation to the CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guests in salt solutions, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblocks to be visualized, understood, and regulated.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Selective Amide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the selective activation of amides has flourished over the last decades. In the past four years, this area has become a rapidly developing domain. This Minireview aims to highlight the breakthroughs in amide activation achieved since 2018, with a focus on significant advances in electrophilic and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed amide activation, as well as other strategies on amide activation and functionalisation.







Abstract
In contrast to ketones and carboxylic esters, amides are classically seen as comparatively unreactive members of the carbonyl family, owing to their unique structural and electronic features. However, recent decades have seen the emergence of research programmes focused on the selective activation of amides under mild conditions. In the past four years, this area has continued to rapidly develop, with new advances coming in at a fast pace. Several novel activation strategies have been demonstrated as effective tools for selective amide activation, enabling transformations that are at once synthetically useful and mechanistically intriguing. This Minireview comprises recent advances in the field, highlighting new trends and breakthroughs in what could be called a new age of amide activation.

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For dynamic polymer materials to respond to their environment and be tailored towards an application, the timescale of bond exchange must be tuned. Both chemical structural modifications and external factors such as temperature, catalyst, and matrix can be used to fine&#8208;tune the timescales of exchange. This Review focuses on the tools available to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymeric materials.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine&#8208;tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This Review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, Thiol&#8211;Michael exchange, Diels&#8211;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This Review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this Review proposes strategies for tailoring the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials through both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Crotylation of Alcohol Proelectrophiles via Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Auto&#8208;Transfer Mediated by Methylallene and Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS&#8208;catalysts affect anti&#8208;crotylation of primary alcohols mediated by methylallene or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to provide polyketide propionate motifs. These C&#8722;C bond formations are byproduct&#8208;free and can be conducted in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of anti&#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide&#8197;B (C9&#8211;C15) and leucascandrolide&#8197;A (C9&#8211;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet wave functions of BODIPY dimers with symmetrically structured ethynylene or butadienylene linker are highly localized on one BODIPY moiety, which differs from previous findings for meso&#8208;to&#8208;meso porphyrin oligomers. This study provides a new understanding of triplet state confinement and molecular symmetry.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne/butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12&#8211;14&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemisorbing a prototypical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to a dense packed layer of metalloporphyrins pulls out complete metalloporphyrins into the second layer. This dynamic and reversible phenomenon unravels by structural, spectroscopic, desorption and theoretical investigations. The molecular rearrangement of the metallorganic layer is paralleled to NHCs pulling out single metal atoms from surfaces due to strong adsorption.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analysed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganisation can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalisation of surfaces with carbenes.

&lt;p&gt;Chemisorbing a prototypical N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to a dense packed layer of metalloporphyrins pulls out complete metalloporphyrins into the second layer. This dynamic and reversible phenomenon unravels by structural, spectroscopic, desorption and theoretical investigations. The molecular rearrangement of the metallorganic layer is paralleled to NHCs pulling out single metal atoms from surfaces due to strong adsorption.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Steering the Ultrafast Opening and Closure Dynamics of a Photochromic Coordination Cage by Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast photodynamics of a dithienylethene&#8208;based coordination cage have been shown to vary depending on the nature of the encapsulated guest molecules. The ring&#8208;closure of the cage ligand can be suppressed through steric effects, while the reverse reaction competes with a population of the 3MLCT state that is enhanced by appropriate guest molecules.







Abstract
Photochemical studies on supramolecular hosts that can encapsulate small guest molecules commonly focus on three aspects: photoswitching the cage to release or trap the guest, the effect of the confining environment on the guest, and light&#8208;induced exciton or charge transfer within the cage structure. Here, we exploit ultrafast spectroscopy to address how the guest alters the photoswitching characteristics of the cage. For this, the impacts of three disparate guest compounds on ring&#8208;opening or ring&#8208;closure of a dithienylethene (DTE) ligand in a photoswitchable DTE&#8208;based coordination cage are juxtaposed. The guest modulates both outcome and timescale of the cage's photodynamics, by an interplay of structural strain, heavy&#8208;atom effect, and enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer processes exercised by the guest on the photo&#8208;excited cage. The approach might prove beneficial for attuning the applicability of photoswitchable nanocontainers and desired guest compounds.

The ring-closure of the cage ligand can be suppressed through steric effects, while the reverse reaction competes with a population of the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT state that is enhanced by appropriate guest molecules.
