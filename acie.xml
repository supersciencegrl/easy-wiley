         <title>Decoding the Chemical Language of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides from the Untapped Archaea Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary metabolites (SMs) are essential across all life domains, yet those originating from the Archaea domain remain poorly understood. Here, the systematic genome mining and the pioneering heterologous expression of archaeal SMs have revealed the chemical landscape of archaeal lanthipeptides, showing both canonical and non&#8208;canonical forms. These lanthipeptides exhibit antagonistic activity and activate the host's motility, likely shaping the archaeal community and mediating environmental adaptation.








Abstract
Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in&#8208;depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified 24 lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino&#8208;dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod&#8208;shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM&#8208;mediated interaction.

         <title>Capturing Unstable Carbanionic Intermediates via Halogen Transfer: Base&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling Reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethylarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The merger of deprotonation and halogenation into compatible processes provides a new strategy for functionalizing traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates, including &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanions. This capability is leveraged toward the first general method for oxidative coupling of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylarenes with common pronucleophiles to produce valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic (thio)ethers.








Abstract
We describe how the merger of deprotonation, halogenation, and substitution into compatible processes enables the productive functionalization of traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates. This strategy enables the first oxidative coupling protocol of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic C&#9472;H bonds with heteronucleophiles. Here, transiently generated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanionic intermediates undergo halogen transfer from 2&#8208;bromothiophenes to form electrophilic ArCF2Br compounds for in situ nucleophilic substitution, thereby avoiding &#945;&#8208;fluoride elimination pathways that typically plague &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanions. This method streamlines the modular synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzyl(thio)ethers and led to the broader realization that halogen transfer to unstable carbanions is an enabling principle across diverse C(sp2)&#9472;H and C(sp3)&#9472;H systems.

         <title>Antibacterial Siderophores of Pandoraea Pathogens and Their Impact on the Diseased Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of environmental and pathogenic Pandoraea species identified a conserved NRPS gene cluster and led to the discovery of novel siderophores, pandorabactins, which exert their antibacterial activity by depleting iron from competitors. Bioinformatic analysis of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients coupled with bioassays indicates that pandorabactins outcompete other bacteria in sequestering iron and have an impact on the diseased lung microbiota.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics&#8208;guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.

         <title>Photovoltaic Absorber &#8220;Glues&#8221; for Efficient Bifacial Selenium Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glue&#8208;bonding strategy using high&#8208;viscosity molten selenium (Se) as an adhesive is reported to bond two fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, creating bifacial solar cells without magnetron sputtering. The Se cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, with efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8.








Abstract
Bifacial solar cells hold great potential for achieving higher power output than conventional monofacial devices by harvesting solar irradiance from both their front and rear surfaces. However, almost all currently reported bifacial devices typically require a sputtered rear transparent conducting oxide electrode, which can damage the underlying layers due to plasma effects during the deposition process. Here, we report a glue&#8208;bonding strategy that uses a high&#8208;viscosity photovoltaic absorber slurry&#8212;in the case of molten selenium (Se)&#8212;as the adhesive to bond two charge&#8208;transport layer&#8208;deposited commercial fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide glasses, directly creating bifacial solar cells without the use of magnetron sputtering. We find that molten Se exhibits relatively high viscosity, high stability, and Newtonian fluid characteristics, facilitating film formation using this strategy. The resulting bifacial Se solar cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, surpassing all types of conventional thin&#8208;film solar cells. These cells achieve efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun illumination with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8, with no efficiency loss after 1000&#160;h of ambient storage.

         <title>Effect of Alternating Polarity in Electrochemical Olefin Hydrocarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating polarity (AP) is a powerful tool for controlling selectivity in olefin hydrofunctionalization, but this use is underdeveloped. Using electrochemical olefin hydrocarboxylation as a model, we highlight how AP controls product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition. It hinders overreduction, limiting dicarboxylation and electrode passivation, and facilitates a unique electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) mechanism.








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of radical anions from feedstock olefins offers a selective and efficient route for synthesizing commodity chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors via hydrofunctionalization. Traditional methods for electrochemical olefin hydrofunctionalization, for example, hydrocarboxylation, rely on anion intermediates and follow an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;electrochemical&#8211;chemical (ECEC) mechanism involving olefin reduction, carboxylation, further reduction, and protonation. Enhancing terminal carboxylate selectivity often requires a proton source, reducing functional group tolerance and favoring proton reduction over olefin reduction. Alternating polarity, a nascent technique in organic electrochemistry, can improve product selectivity by influencing electron transfer rates and electrode surface species.

     alt="Effect of Alternating Polarity in Electrochemical Olefin Hydrocarboxylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternating polarity (AP) is a powerful tool for controlling selectivity in olefin hydrofunctionalization, but this use is underdeveloped. Using electrochemical olefin hydrocarboxylation as a model, we highlight how AP controls product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition. It hinders overreduction, limiting dicarboxylation and electrode passivation, and facilitates a unique electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical generation of radical anions from feedstock olefins offers a selective and efficient route for synthesizing commodity chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors via hydrofunctionalization. Traditional methods for electrochemical olefin hydrofunctionalization, for example, hydrocarboxylation, rely on anion intermediates and follow an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;electrochemical&#8211;chemical (ECEC) mechanism involving olefin reduction, carboxylation, further reduction, and protonation. Enhancing terminal carboxylate selectivity often requires a proton source, reducing functional group tolerance and favoring proton reduction over olefin reduction. Alternating polarity, a nascent technique in organic electrochemistry, can improve product selectivity by influencing electron transfer rates and electrode surface species. Herein, we report the use of alternating polarity to selectively generate radical anions from styrene derivatives, using electrochemical hydrocarboxylation as a model. This approach shifts the mechanism to an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) pathway, where the final step involves hydrogen atom transfer. We showcase how alternating polarity modulates product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition, offering new insights into how alternating polarity can advance olefin functionalization by enabling more controlled and selective reaction pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Based Galvanic Potentiometric Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Serotonin Signaling Under Psychosocial Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorothioate aptamer&#8208;based galvanic redox potentiometric sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of serotonin in a mouse model of psychosocial stress. It reveals, for the first time, a distinct correlation between serotonin release and social hierarchy, with higher serotonin levels in dominant mice.








Abstract
Psychosocial stress, a pervasive factor in mental health disorders, is tightly linked to serotonin (5&#8208;HT) dysregulation. Real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of 5&#8208;HT in vivo is challenged by interference from vitamin C (Vc) and biofouling, requiring invasive pretreatments. We present a self&#8208;powered aptamer&#8208;engineered galvanic sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) that integrates phosphorothioate aptamers with a redox potentiometric mechanism, achieving 21.5&#8208;fold higher selectivity and 98.3&#8208;fold enhanced sensitivity against Vc over conventional sensors while resisting electrochemical biofouling. The aptGRP5&#8208;HT operates in complex biological environments without pretreatment, enabling direct monitoring in a rodent psychosocial stress model. Using this tool, we uncover a neurochemical signature of social hierarchy: high&#8208;ranking mice exhibit elevated 5&#8208;HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with region&#8208;specific correlations to neuronal activity&#8208;reduced spontaneous firing in the mPFC and increased activity in the DRN. This work resolves long&#8208;standing challenges in neurochemical sensing and establishes aptGRP5&#8208;HT as a transformative platform for probing brain function and stress&#8208;related disorders.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Lithium Recovery From Spent LiFePO4 Stabilizes Ferricyanide Catholyte for Durable Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated lithium recovery from spent LiFePO4 batteries enables high&#8208;solubility catholytes (up to 1.74&#160;M [Fe(CN)6]4&#8315;) for ultra&#8208;stable alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries. This dual&#8208;function strategy integrates sustainable lithium recycling with advanced energy storage, achieving enhanced cycling stability and energy density.








Abstract
The scarcity of lithium resources and the increasing volume of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exacerbate the imbalance between lithium supply and demand. The development of efficient recovery strategies of valuable lithium ion (Li+) from spent LIBs and their subsequent utilization presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose an innovative approach for Li+ recovery from spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries (LFPs) and its subsequent utilization in alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries (AZFFBs). Utilizing a redox&#8208;mediated reaction, we achieve exceptional Li+ recovery efficiency from spent LFPs. Furthermore, the recovered Li+ in solution leads to the elevated ionic strength in the electrolyte, enhancing the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to a remarkable level of 1.74&#160;M. Utilizing the above catholyte, an AZFFB cell demonstrates the cycling life extending to 11&#160;000 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.00019% per cycle and 0.09% per day at a current density of 120&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient protocol that eliminates additional intermediate processes, achieving effective Li+ recovery from spent LFPs and subsequent utilization in flow batteries. The resulting AZFFB exhibits high energy density and long lifespan, positioning it as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.

         <title>Insertion of Nitriles Into a Gold(III)/Carbene Bond: A Direct and Powerful Entry to Imino&#8208;Substituted Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable imino&#8208;substituted Au(III) carbenes are easily and efficiently prepared by trapping the transient (N^C^C)Au&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene with nitriles. The corresponding free species are readily generated and display dual carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivities. The diazo decomposition, nitrile insertion, and carbene transfer can be combined in three&#8208;component Au(III)&#8208;catalyzed transformations.








Abstract
Strikingly, very little is known so far about reactive gold(III) carbenes. They have been proposed as key intermediates in a few reactions but remain chemical curiosities. Taking into account the enhanced electrophilicity of cationic Au(III) carbene complexes, we were intrigued by their reactivity with nitriles. Thus, we discovered a simple and efficient entry to imino&#8208;substituted carbenes. The transient (N^C^C)Au(III)&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene readily reacts with acetonitrile, benzonitrile, and diisopropyl cyanamide, affording stable and isolable Au(III) carbene complexes. Here, the imino group acts either as a strongly &#960;&#8208;donating or a spectator substituent. Ligand exchange at Au(III) or protodeauration/deprotonation provides access to the corresponding free species, which display dual imino&#8208;carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivity, as substantiated by stoichiometric and catalytic dimerization, O&#9472;H insertion and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta C&#9472;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. 








Abstract
Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote metaselective C&#9472;H functionalization of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8211;norbornyl&#8211;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.

         <title>Low&#8208;Entropy and Fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte With Cascade Reaction&#8208;Induced Robust Interphase for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;entropy and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;conducting electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stabilized interfacial phase and fast Li+ transport kinetics has been designed, and the electrolyte formulation can provide excellent fast cycling performance of lithium metal batteries. This work emphasizes an effective electrolyte design strategy and gives a new design idea to facilitate the practical application of fast&#8208;charging LMBs.








Abstract
Lithium metal is considered the most promising next&#8208;generation anode, while its fast&#8208;charging application is hindered by the problems of dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a low&#8208;entropy electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stable interphase and fast Li+ transport kinetics is proposed to provide excellent fast&#8208;charging performance of lithium metal batteries. In this electrolyte with an extremely simple formula, only two co&#8208;solvents with a lithium salt are used without any other additives. Fast lithium transport and desolvation kinetics are maintained, owing to the solvents&#8217; low viscosity and weak interaction with lithium. Particularly, the intermediate products of lithium salt can further promote rapid defluorination of the F&#8208;containing solvent to form LiF, constructing a LiF&#8208;rich interphase. Fast Li+ transport kinetics and robust interphase enable the fast&#8208;cycling performance of lithium metal anodes. The Li||Li symmetric cell can even withstand a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Good cycling stability under fast charging is also achieved with a capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained with a capacity retention rate reaching 90% after 200 cycles at a charging rate of 6C. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective electrolyte design strategy facilitating the fast cycling of lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Electrostatic Potential Matching in an Anion&#8208;Pillared Framework for Benchmark Hexafluoroethane Purification from Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic potential matching in the anion&#8208;pillared SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu realizes effective anchoring of CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions, exhibiting the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity as well as unprecedented CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 selectivity, thereby achieving benchmark separation of ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture. 








Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of CF3CF3 from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture is crucial since its vital role in the semiconductor industry. However, efficient separation of chemically inert CF&#8323;CF&#8323; remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating specific recognition sites in porous materials. In this work, we report the first example of anion&#8208;pillared MOFs to the separation of fluorinated electronic specialty gases, utilizing the unique electrostatic potential matching in the bipolar pores of SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to realize a benchmark CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 separation. SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity at 0.01&#160;bar, as well as the highest CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 IAST selectivity. Additionally, high&#8208;purity (&#8805; 99.995%) CF3CF3 with record productivity (882.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1) can be acquired through one&#8208;step breakthrough experiment of CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 (5/5/90). Theoretical calculations further reveal that the coexistence of electronegative SiF62&#8722; and partially electropositive H sites promotes SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to effectively anchor CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Hopping Diffusion in Wiggling Nanopore Architecture of MOF Enabling Synergistic Equilibrium&#8208;Kinetic Separation of Fluorinated Propylene and Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address a critical challenge in electronic specialty gas (ESG) purification, we herein present a zirconium&#8208;based MOF with &#8220;wiggling pore geometry&#8221; featuring alternating narrow apertures and enlarged cavities. This architecture establishes an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation mechanism: narrow windows (nw) kinetically hinder C3F8 diffusion (DC3F6/DC3F8&#160;&#8776;&#160;450), while F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions in cavities thermodynamically favor C3F6 adsorption.








Abstract
The separation of octafluoropropane (C3F8) from hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) is an industrially important yet challenging process due to their similar physicochemical properties and stringent purity demands in industrial applications. Herein, we address this task through precise pore architecture in a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;PMA), which exhibits unique &#8220;wiggling nanopores&#8221; with narrow windows and large cavities. The narrow windows act as diffusion barriers, selectively restricting C3F8 transport, while the large cavities provide strong adsorption sites for C3F6, enabling an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation. This dual functionality results in a &#8764;450&#8208;fold difference in diffusion rates and exceptional kinetic selectivity for C3F6 over C3F8, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, time&#8208;resolved kinetics, and dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations coupled with in situ spectroscopy elucidate the pore geometry&#8208;dependent hopping diffusion mechanism responsible for the separation. This work establishes wiggling pore geometry as a versatile paradigm for advanced adsorbents targeting energy&#8208;efficient separations of structurally similar fluorocarbon mixtures.

         <title>A Method for Constructing Nucleosome Arrays with Spatially Defined Histone PTMs and DNA Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work advances methodology by addressing challenges in mimicking the complex in vivo spatial relationships of histone acetylation and DNA damage. The combination of an abiotic/enzymatic hybrid catalyst system (ABEHCS) and the plug&#8208;and&#8208;play method has constituted a versatile platform to construct nucleosome arrays with precise histone acetylation and DNA damage patterns. 








Abstract
DNA damage repair mechanisms, such as base excision repair (BER), safeguard cells against genotoxic agents that cause genetic instability and diseases, including cancer. In eukaryotic nuclei, DNA within nucleosome arrays is less accessible to repair factors than naked DNA owing to the structural constraints of chromatin. Histone acetylation is crucial for loosening the chromatin structure and facilitating access to damaged DNA, yet its effects&#8212;particularly in histone globular domains&#8212;on BER in nucleosome arrays remain unexplored. Herein, we employ an abiotic/enzymatic hybrid catalyst system (ABEHCS) and a plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy to regioselectively introduce histone acetylation and deoxycytidine&#8208;to&#8208;deoxyuridine DNA damage. This approach enables the construction of nucleosome arrays with diverse spatial configurations of histone acetylation and DNA lesions, similar to those found in living organisms. Our findings reveal that H3K56 acetylation in the histone globular domain enhances BER efficiency mediated by UDG and APE1 in nucleosome arrays, contingent upon the spatial relationship between H3K56Ac and the DNA damage site.

         <title>Imaging Heterogeneous Patterns of Aminopeptidase N Activity in Hierarchical Tissue Structures Through High&#8208;Resolution Whole&#8208;Organ 3D Mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes regulate physiological functions, and their abnormal activity is associated with diseases. Here, we present a method for high&#8208;resolution 3D mapping of enzyme activity using tissue clearing and an activity&#8208;based covalent probe. Focusing on aminopeptidase N, we developed ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY, which records enzyme activity via covalent labeling. This enables whole&#8208;organ imaging, revealing activity heterogeneity and inhibitor effects.








Abstract
Enzymes play a crucial role in regulating physiological functions, and abnormal enzyme activity is associated with various pathological conditions. Precise imaging of enzyme activity in tissues, providing detailed spatial and quantitative information, advances our understanding of physiological and pathological processes. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of methods for high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging of enzyme activity across entire tissues. In this research, we report a methodology for high&#8208;resolution, whole&#8208;organ 3D mapping of enzyme activity, which combines tissue clearing with an activity&#8208;based covalent chemical probe. Focusing on aminopeptidase N (APN) as a representative target of peptidase, we developed ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY, an activity&#8208;based covalent fluorescent probe compatible with tissue clearing for imaging APN activity. Upon activation by APN, ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY produces a reactive intermediate, aza&#8208;quinone methide, which covalently binds to proximal proteins. This covalent probe is successfully utilized to record the location of APN activity during the tissue&#8208;clearing process. By combining the probe with tissue clearing, we have achieved high&#8208;resolution 3D mapping of APN activity across whole organs for the first time. Moreover, this advancement allowed us to visualize the heterogeneity of APN activity in individual tubular structures and to uncover the inhibitory effects of different APN inhibitors.

         <dc:description>
Two new quaternary ammonium TFSI ionic liquids, [MNPA][TFSI] and [NPPA][TFSI] were designed and synthesized. These ionic liquids readily dissolve quaternary ammonium fluorides (&gt;0.7&#160;M), and the resulting electrolytes have a wide operational voltage range (&gt;5.4&#160;V). Battery performance using Np2F/[MNPA][TFSI] demonstrated stable and reversible (de)fluorination reaction, with stable fluoride ion shuttling for 100&#160;h. 








Abstract
Two novel liquid electrolytes for room&#8208;temperature fluoride ion batteries are presented. These electrolytes are based on ionic liquids with quaternary ammonium cations 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N,N,N,2,2&#8208;pentamethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (MNPA) and N,N,N,2,2&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)propane&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (NPPA) combined with a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)&#8208;imide (TFSI) counterion. Quaternary ammonium fluorides can be added at concentrations up to 0.7&#160;M to a functional fluoride electrolyte with a total diffusivity of 4.99&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;12&#160;m2&#160;s&#8722;1, a viscosity of 260&#160;mP&#8901;s and a wide operational voltage range exceeding 5.4&#160;V. The liquid ion electrolyte with the MNPA cation supports stable fluoride ion shuttling for up to 100 h.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Peptide Nanotubes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptide&#8211;polymer conjugates, with varied length of hydrophobic alkyl linker group, are synthesized and assembled into nanotubes in water. Both synthetic studies and computational molecular dynamics simulations confirm the degree of hydrophobicity, providing an avenue to tune the length and dynamic nature of the peptide nanotubes.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;conjugated peptides are attractive building blocks for the construction of new nanomaterials. However, the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of these materials remains a major limitation to their wider utilization. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fine&#8208;tune the assembly of water&#8208;soluble hydrophilic polymer&#8208;conjugated cyclic peptides by incorporating a defined, short hydrocarbon linker between the polymer and peptide. This addition creates a well&#8208;defined hydrophobic &#8220;inner shell&#8221; that suppresses water from disrupting the organized peptide hydrogen bond network. Our approach is demonstrated using a series of cyclic peptide&#8208;linker&#8208;PDMA conjugates that were evaluated by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation, small angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations were also used to show how the polymer and the peptide stacks interact and illustrate the impact of this hydrophobic inner shell approach. This strategy provides a modular approach to fine control the nanotube self&#8208;assembling behavior. We expect that this technique will improve the versatility of peptide nanotubes for the engineering of advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting, Vacancy&#8208;Rich HxIrOy Nanosheets for the Fabrication of Low&#8208;Ionomer&#8208;Dependent Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrOx and protonic conducting ionomer, and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalysts that possesses both IrOx&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack, and demonstrate its ability to construct high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton&#8208;conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K0.5(Na0.2Ir0.8)O2 and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancies&#8208;rich, 1 nm&#8208;thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in&#8208;plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy allows the fabrication of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer with enhanced exposure of catalytic sites and reduced electronic contact resistance, in contrast to common fully mixed catalyst/ionomer layer in PEMWE. This work represents an example of realizing the structural innovation in anode catalyst layer through the bifunctionality of anode catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Spider Eye Development Editing and Silk Fiber Engineering Using CRISPR&#8208;Cas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 gene editing represents an effective and precise technology to induce mutations in the genome, and it has been applied to a wide range of organisms for diverse purposes. However, CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing in spiders has not been reported to date. In this study, we demonstrate CRISPR&#8208;mediated microinjection in parental spiders leading to both knock&#8208;out (KO) and knock&#8208;in (KI) mutations within the spider&#8217;s offspring. The KO of the gene sine oculis causes total eye loss, confirming the role of the gene in the development of all spider eyes. The knock&#8208;in of a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP&#8208;KI) within a spider silk gene encoding one compound of the major ampullate silk of the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum yields red fluorescent silk fibers. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of functionalizing silk proteins in spiders using CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing without influencing silk assembly. Our study expands the application of CRISPR to spiders and provides insights in the fields of developmental genetics as well as material sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Data Guides the Discovery of Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Inhibitors Using DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadening the application of covalent inhibitors requires the exploration of nucleophilic residues beyond cysteine. The covalent DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (CoDEL) represents an advanced technology for covalent drug discovery. However, its application in lysine&#8208;targeting inhibitors remains uncharted territory. Here, we report the utilization of CoDEL selection guided by proteome&#8208;wide data to identify lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. A comprehensive assessment of activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) data on lysine distribution and ligandability reveals potential targets for selective covalent inhibition, including phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), bromodomain (BRD) family proteins, and ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N). The 10.7&#8208;million&#8208;member CoDELs, featuring diverse lysine&#8208;reactive warheads, enables the discovery of a series of covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. In&#8208;depth characterization of binding sites and modes of action provides structural and functional insights. Notably, irreversible covalent inhibitors unveil a novel mechanism for regulating UBE2N&#8208;mediated ubiquitination by modulating the conformation of the protein complex. Our work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy, offering an efficient and versatile selection method for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting functional lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Disorders within Cathode Materials of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials has been increasing. The energy densities of cathode materials have been improved by adapting structural deviation from the ideal fully ordered &#945;&#8208;NaFeO2 type, but that led to limitations in terms of structural stability and safety. Although disorders in cathode materials are closely related to their electrochemical properties, unfortunately, characterizing the disorder itself in cathode materials has been challenging due to its complex parasitic reaction and strong correlation with other disorders occurring during charge/discharge. In this review, we categorize various disorders by their scales of ordering from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range. We addressed the principles of various characterization tools to figure out how they can help to identify the structural disorder in cathode materials. Specifically, we focused on the underlying principles of each characterization technique to correlate different disorder&#8208;driven phenomena through several case studies. It underscores the substantial importance of disorder&#8208;property relationships and the corresponding characterization methods, which can provide novel research strategies for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials with decent structural stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Iron(III) Catalysis for Late&#8208;Stage C&#8211;H Fluoroalkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective functionalization of complex molecules poses a fundamental challenge. In this regard, the synergetic combination of photoexcitation with electron transfer by anodic oxidation bears unique potential for novel reaction manifolds that go beyond individual photo&#8208; or electrochemistry.[1&#8208;3] Herein, we introduce a resource&#8208;economic photoelectrocatalysis strategy to enable versatile direct fluoroalkylations catalyzed by Earth&#8208;abundant iron and paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the devised approach proved amenable to versatile late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H fluoroalkylations of bio&#8208;relevant heterocycles, such as xanthines, nucleobases, and nucleosides. Mechanistic studies supported a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer&#8208;induced formation of the fluoroalkyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Locked Peptide&#8208;DNA Nanostructures for CRISPR&#8208;Amplified Activity&#8208;Based Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a new class of chemical probes for activity&#8208;based sensing of proteases, termed Cleavable, Locked Initiator Probes (CLIPs). CLIPs contain a protease&#8208;cleavable peptide linked between two programmable DNA strands &#8211; an &#8220;initiator&#8221; DNA and a shorter &#8220;blocking&#8221; DNA. These DNA sequences are designed to hybridize, creating a &#8220;locked&#8221; hairpin&#8208;like structure. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the initiator strand is released, triggering the activation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a enzymes and producing an amplified fluorescence response. CLIPs generate more than 20&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals at room temperature (25&#176;C), significantly outperforming commercial probes by yielding ~40&#8208;fold lower limits of detection (LOD) at 100&#8208;fold lower concentrations. Their versatility enables the detection of various disease&#8208;relevant proteases &#8211; including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, caspase&#8208;3, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;7, and cathepsin B &#8211; simply by altering the peptide sequence. Importantly, CLIPs detect cathepsin B in four different colorectal cancer cell lines, highlighting their clinical potential. Taken together, the sensitivity (LOD: ~88 pM), selectivity, and rapid assay time (down to 35 minutes), combined with the ability to operate in complex biological media with minimal sample preparation, position CLIPs as powerful chemical tools for activity&#8208;based sensing of functional enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Silyl Groups Enhance Hydrolytic Stability and Photocleavage Efficiency in Carbamates for Protein Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocleavable molecules are valuable tools for biological studies, enabling spatiotemporal activation of molecular functions within cellular environments. In particular, coumarin&#8208;based photolytic molecules are useful because of their ability to flexibly tune the wavelength of photostimulation through their structural modifications. Ideal photocleavable molecular tools require hydrolytic stability and selective susceptibility to photo stimuli. However conventional coumarin&#8208;based molecules have not simultaneously achieved both highly efficient photocleavage and hydrolysis resistance. Herein, we proposed a novel molecular design concept that introduces a silyl group into coumarin&#8208;based molecules at a position remote from the photolabile bond, creating an ideal photocleavable molecule for chemical biology tools. The established orbital effect of the remotely introduced silyl group improves the photolysis efficiency of coumarin&#8208;based molecules, while its bulkiness substantially enhances their hydrolytic stability in aqueous environments and under enzymatic conditions. Furthermore, this improvement in molecular functionality contributes to the development of high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;release biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Geometry&#8208;Property Relationship of Benzodipyrrole&#8208;Based A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular geometry plays a crucial role in determining photovoltaic&#160;properties of organic semiconductor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we used dichlorine&#8208;substituted benzene as the A&#8217; unit in A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) and synthesized&#160;four isomers of the benzodipyrrole&#8208;based SMAs (C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, &#577;&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, M&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl) with C, &#577;, M, and S molecular geometries, and the effect of the molecular geometry on their photovoltaic performance was studied. We revealed that the molecular geometry influences the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in three aspects: (1) intrinsic physicochemical properties, including energy levels, absorption and reorganization energy; (2) molecular stacking pattern, which govern the exciton diffusion and charge transport process; and (3) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction and miscibility. We found that the C&#8208;shaped molecular geometry possesses suitable energy level and absorption range, dense and ordered molecular stacking, and improved donor&#8208;acceptor interactions and miscibility. These advantages enable a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the binary OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl active layer. The other shaped SMAs showed weaknesses in different aspects, such as limited absorption of &#577;&#8208;shaped SMA, large reorganization energies and loose molecular stacking of M&#8208;shaped SMA, low solubility and strong aggregation of S&#8208;shaped SMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor via Increasing Interfacial Disorder to Inhibit Bimolecular Recombination for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inferior fill factor (FF) is one of main reasons impeding further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). But no theoretical framework for high FFs has been established yet. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to enhance FFs via introducing a small molecule, CNDT, into active layer to increase electron donor/acceptor interface disorder, raise energy barrier for charge back transfer, and thus reduce bimolecular recombination rate constant (krec). CNDTs tend to distribute over donor/acceptor interfaces and disturb molecular stacking of Y6 to deliver more disordered donor/acceptor interfaces but higher crystal quality in the D18:Y6+ blend film, compared to D18:Y6. Altogether, in the D18:Y6+ blend film, a higher energy of charge transfer state magnifies energy barrier for charge recombination to decrease charge recombination rate/ratio and reduce krec, inhibiting bimolecular recombination in devices. Therefore, FFs of OSCs are improved from 75.78% (D18:Y6) to 81.13% (D18:Y6+), yielding a higher PCE of 19.45%. Moreover, D18:L8&#8208;BO+ based OSCs feature FFs over 83%, a record for OSCs so far. PCE increases subsequently to 19.80%. It demonstrates that increasing interface disorder without sacrificing crystal quality enhances energy barrier of charge recombination and inhibits bimolecular recombination to efficiently improve FFs for higher PCEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Highly Reversible Four&#8208;electron Redox of S/Cu2S for Aqueous Zn/S&#8208;Cu Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of sulfur (S) cathode with Cu2+/Cu+ redox carriers has been considered as a promising cathode for the next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage device due to the high specific capacity (two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion), intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory cycling stability of Sulfur&#8208;Copper (S&#8208;Cu) cathode hinders its practical application. Herein, the two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversions are firstly decoupled in our study, identifying the inferior conversion reversibility between the charging intermedia CuS and the final product S as the primary cause for deteriorate cycling capability. Concerning the different hydrated dimensions of the Cu(H2O)62+ and Cu(H2O)2+, the strategy of "spatial confinement" is proposed to alter the oxidation path of Cu2S and prevent the formation of the intermedia CuS. To ensure the efficient S incorporation into the spatially confined carbon matrix, chalcogen element selenium (Se) is employed to "cut" the S8 into short&#8208;chain molecules. Consequently, the well&#8208;designed S&#8208;Cu cathode achieves one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron reaction and exhibits superior electrochemical stability with an average capacity attenuation of 0.034% during 700 cycles. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the conversion mechanism for the S&#8208;Cu cathode within the spatial&#8208;confinement environment, and renders valuable insights for developing advanced conversion&#8208;type cathodes in aqueous energy&#8208;storage device.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated and Paired Metal Sites in Zeolites using Solid&#8208;State Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolated and paired extraframework transition metal cations in zeolites are emerging as top candidates for numerous applications not limited to selective methane oxidation to methanol, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, propane dehydrogenation, propylene epoxidation, and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Importantly, these well&#8208;defined heterogeneous catalysts offer parallels with molecular and metalloenzyme catalytic active sites. Aqueous&#8208;phase ion exchange (APIE) is the most common synthesis technique to obtain these catalysts. Solid&#8208;state ion exchange (SSIE) is an often&#8208;overlooked technique that offers synthetic advantages compared to APIE. Thus, recent advances in solid&#8208;state synthesis strategies merit contemporary contextualization. In this minireview we describe the basic principles, methods, mechanisms, challenges, and advances in&#160;solid&#8208;state ion exchange in the context of&#160;well&#8208;defined transition metal cation&#160;active sites located in extraframework positions of the zeolite.</dc:description>

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Comparing to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183; [SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4 (tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3 (Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M=Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X=Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity which is dependent on their different electronic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Complex Electrochemical Reaction Dynamics and Interactions of Single Nano&#8208;Entities via Evanescent Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reactions at the nanoscale are governed by intricate surface interactions, yet existing imaging techniques often lack the surface sensitivity and throughput needed to resolve these dynamics clearly. Here, we introduce electrochemical evanescent scattering microscopy (EC&#8208;ESM), a high&#8208;throughput, surface&#8208;sensitive imaging technique that enables real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;nanoentity electrochemistry with high resolution. Using EC&#8208;ESM, we monitored the motion and dissolution dynamics of silver nanoparticles and identified a clear relationship between nanoparticle velocity and electron transfer rates. The high throughput of EC&#8208;ESM not only ensures statistical reliability but also allows the detection of rare electron transfer events in molecularly modified AgNPs. Additionally, EC&#8208;ESM&#8217;s high resolution enabled direct imaging of both single and interacting silver nanowires, revealing diverse dissolution behaviors that provide insights into structural and surface properties. We envision EC&#8208;ESM as a powerful platform for advancing nanoscale electrochemical research and interfacial charge transfer studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Tri&#8208;coordinated Cobalt Sites in Silicate&#8208;1 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) emerges as a sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. However, metal catalysts are commonly supported by graphitic carbon that are susceptible to be oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated in ORR and have limited oxygen capacities. Here, we report a silica based electrocatalyst embedding cobalt (Co) sites into silicate&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolite, which exhibited exceptional 2e&#8208; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of S&#8208;1 zeolite highly isolated Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. The nanochannels of S&#8208;1 zeolite further provide robust and substantial reaction spaces, where the Co(OSi)3 moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption and holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieved high Faradaic efficiency over 96% and a steady yield of 11.56 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in a gas diffusion electrode setup. This work provides a novel insight into 2e&#8208; ORR on Co sites and highlights the potential of zeolite&#8208;based materials for electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Conversion of Hydrogen Peroxide and Benzaldehyde in Air by Silver Single&#8208;Atom Modified Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized g&#8208;C3N4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the synthesis of silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride ( Ag@T&#8208;C3N4), a material with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. Under visible light, Ag@T&#8208;C3N4 catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, achieving production rates of 4729.82 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for H2O2 and 19.71 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for benzaldehyde. The synergy between thiophene conjugation and silver atoms extends visible light absorption and accelerates the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enhancing H2O2 yield. Photogenerated holes oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, while the biphasic benzaldehyde&#8208;water system enables spontaneous product separation. In situ Raman spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode testing, EPR, GC&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations highlight the critical role of thiophene&#8208;silver synergy in optimizing reaction pathways, enhancing catalyst&#8208;intermediate interactions, and reducing Gibbs free energy, improving H2O2 and benzaldehyde synthesis. This study provides new insights for designing carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers a strategy for co&#8208;producing value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Spatial Transcriptomics on the Same Cancer Tissues to Identify Gene&#8208;Metabolite Correlations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Innovations in spatial omics technologies applied to human tissues have led to breakthrough discoveries in various diseases, including cancer. Two of these approaches &#8208; spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics &#8208; have blossomed independently, fueled by technologies such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). While powerful, these technologies only offer insights into the spatial distributions of restricted classes of molecules and have not yet been integrated to provide more holistic insights into biological questions. These techniques can be performed on adjacent serial sections from the same sample, but section&#8208;to&#8208;section variability can convolute data integration. We present a novel method combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI&#8208;MSI) spatial metabolomics and Visium spatial transcriptomics on the same tissue sections. We show that RNA quality is maintained after performing DESI&#8208;MSI on a tissue and that ST data is unperturbed following DESI&#8208;MSI. We demonstrate this workflow on human breast and lung cancer tissues and identify novel correlations between metabolites and RNA transcripts in cancer specific regions.</dc:description>

         <title>An A&#8208;T Hoogsteen Base Pair in a Naked DNA Hairpin Motif: A Protein&#8208;Recognized Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In duplex DNA, A&#8208;T and G&#8208;C form Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs, and Hoogsteen pairing only dominates upon protein binding or DNA damage. Using NMR, we show that an A&#8208;T Hoogsteen base pair previously observed in crystal structures of transposon DNA hairpins bound to TnpA protein forms in solution even in the absence of TnpA. This Hoogsteen base pair, located adjacent to a dinucleotide apical loop, exists in dynamic equilibrium with a minor Watson&#8208;Crick conformation (population ~11% and lifetime ~55 &#181;s). Extending the apical loop to three residues inverted the equilibrium, making Watson&#8208;Crick the dominant state and the Hoogsteen conformation recognized by TnpA a minor state (population ~14% and lifetime ~28 &#181;s). The propensity for Hoogsteen pairing depended on apical loop residues, which form contacts directly or indirectly stabilizing the Hoogsteen conformation. A structure survey did not reveal Hoogsteen pairing near RNA apical loops making them unique to DNA. Our results demonstrate that Hoogsteen can be the dominant state even in naked unmodified duplex DNA and identify 5&#8217;&#8208;CTT(T/C)AG&#8208;3&#8217; as a DNA&#8208;specific apical loop motif stabilized by Hoogsteen pairing. Hoogsteen conformations may be prevalent in DNA hairpins forming during replication and transcription, with broad implications for the genomic landscape.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Caged Hydrocarbons as Arenes Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This Minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will inspire further advancements in the enantioselective synthesis of these pharmaceutically valuable caged hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Neighboring Carbon Defects Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation of Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts towards Efficient Aerobic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen (O2) is crucial for aerobic alcohols oxidation, however, flexibly modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to improve the capability remains challenging. Herein the concentration of carbon defects surrounding the nitrogen coordinated cobalt (Co) single atoms on candle soot are controlled just through adjusting the amount of polyethyleneimine which chemically decorates the surface of candle soot to anchor Co ions. The concentration increase of carbon defects boosts the aerobic alcohols oxidation over the Co single&#8208;atom catalyst as well as ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalyst. Moreover, a series of alcohols including those with sensitive groups reach an outstanding yield. Significantly, the calculations and experiments verify that the carbon defects lead to the rearrangement of d&#8208;orbitals of Co atom and an elevation in the spin states of dyz and dz2&#160;orbitals. Furthermore, compared with low&#8208;spin Co atom, the stronger electron&#8208;transfer interaction between high&#8208;spin Co atom and O2 enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and the generation of more superoxide radicals to promote alcohols oxidation. Our findings provide a new way for developing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for sustainable aerobic alcohols oxidation via manipulating the spin configurations of single atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Methanol Activation on Hexagonal CdS for Triggering C&#8211;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven methanol activation paves the way for pursuing C&#8211;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, where selectively converting methanol into the corresponding hydroxymethyl radical (&#8226;CH2OH) is an essential prerequisite. Inspired by the versatile methanol activation on photoexcited solids, we here report a practicable semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic system for C&#8211;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. To be specific, hexagonal cadmium sulfide (h&#8208;CdS) was identified to be an ideal platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic methanol activation, where selective &#8226;CH2OH generation undergoing a hole&#8208;transfer process without any additional co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvent could trigger C&#8211;H hydroxymethylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The following electron transfer between photoexcited h&#8208;CdS and hydroxymethylated intermediates could finally lead to the formation of methylated N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformations facilitate the cascade utilization of photoinduced hole and electron, thereby endowing h&#8208;CdS with extraordinary photocatalytic performance. Besides, selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated product could be facilely implemented in the presence/absence of electron scavengers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Most chemotherapeutic and bioimaging agents struggle with inadequate bioavailability, primarily due to their limited biocompatibility and lack of specificity in targeting, leading to low or decreased anticancer efficacy and inaccurate imaging. To surmount these obstacles, the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, predominantly leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME), has emerged as a promising strategy. Therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be released controllably at the tumor site by virtue of the bond cleavage or hydrophobic to hydrophilic transformation of TME&#8208;sensitive linkages in TME&#8208;responsive systems, thus augmenting cancer treatment and imaging precision, while simultaneously attenuating the damage to healthy tissues and false imaging signals caused by non&#8208;specific drug leakage. In this comprehensive review, we scrutinize recent studies of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, encompassing pH&#8208;, ROS&#8208;, GSH&#8208;, enzyme&#8208;, and hypoxia&#8208;responsive vectors, significantly from the perspective of their molecular design and responsive mechanism, and further summarizing their bio&#8208;application in drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, this review encapsulates the critical challenges and offers an insightful perspective on the future prospects of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H Shift: Unlocking Migration Along Coupling Partners in Olefin Borylcarbofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin migratory functionalization is a well&#8208;established strategy for the selective installation of functional groups at remote C(sp3)&#8722;H positions along an alkyl chain. However, prior research has predominantly focused on migration along the alkene component. Herein, we describe a conceptually new migratory coupling strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, where migration selectively occurs along the C(sp2) coupling partner rather than the alkene component, facilitated by a through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. This approach offers a modular three&#8208;component strategy for the selective and efficient construction of densely functionalized alkyl boronates from readily accessible chemicals. Moreover, by integrating the 1,2&#8208;Ni/H shift with the 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift, this platform has been expanded to achieve a two&#8208;fold migration along both the alkene components and the coupling partners, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp2)&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Active Hydrogen Supply and O2 Adsorption: Sulfur Vacancy Matters for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211;&#160;ORR) represents a promising approach for H2O2 production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O2 adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni&#8208;doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv)&#160;as a dual&#8208;site 2e&#8211; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H2O2 production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&#8211; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron&#8208;rich state enable a Pauling&#8208;type (end&#8208;on) O2 adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O2 and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#8208;O bond cleavage. Besides, the formation of electron&#8208;deficient S sites weakens the S&#8208;Hads bond, facilitating the *Hads migration to adjacent Ni sites and accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of O2 to OOH* intermediate. As a result, the elaborately designed Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv photocatalyst exhibits a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under UV&#8208;vis light irradiation in pure water. Our work offers new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic&#160;p&#8208;type cathode materials with high&#160;redox potentials and fast kinetics&#160;have captured widespread attention in propelling Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs).&#160;However, their anion&#8208;accessible capacity is insufficient due to single electron reaction and/or high energy&#160;barrier of each redox&#8208;active&#160;unit. Here&#160;we design&#160;two&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type organic chalcogen small molecules&#160;(phenoxazine&#160;(PO), phenothiazine&#160;(PS) and&#160;phenoselenazine&#160;(PSe)) with tuned charge&#160;distributions&#160;and electron transfer behaviors&#160;as cathode materials for ZOBs. With the decrease of chalcogenide electronegativity (O&gt;S&gt;Se),&#160;PSe liberates&#160;the strongest&#160;coordination&#160;activity, efficient electron delocalization, and&#160;charge storage&#160;kinetics&#160;with an ultralow redox&#160;activation energy (0.23 vs.&#160;0.34 eV of PS and 0.41 eV of PO), which contributes&#160;to&#160;high dual&#8208;electron&#160;utilization of phenazine motifs&#160;of 99.2% (vs.&#160;68.8% of PS and 52.7% of PO). Consequently, Zn||PSe battery delivers&#160;the highest capacity storage&#160;(227 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (273&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1)&#160;among the reported p&#8208;type&#160;cells, along with long life (10,000 cycles).&#160;A&#160;two&#8208;electron&#160;redox&#160;mechanism&#160;is unlocked&#160;at amine/selenium sites&#160;of PSe, accompanied by reversible&#160;uptake&#160;of two CF3SO3&#8722;&#160;anions.&#160;This study highlights the considerable potential of low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier multielectron design&#160;for high&#8208;performance&#160;organic&#160;cathodes towards advanced ZOBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of hydrogels and functional plasmonic metal nanoparticles affords the development of unique hybrid systems, such as actuators, biosensors, and drug delivery systems, among others. Being typically prepared in colloidal suspension, incorporating shape&#8208;controlled plasmonic nanoparticles on polymer substrates typically requires lengthy processes involving synthesis, washing, and self&#8208;assembly. We report an alternative, robust in situ seed&#8208;mediated growth method, whereby either isotropic or anisotropic Au and Ag nanoparticles can be prepared directly on gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels, taking advantage of the polymer&#8217;s native chemical functionalities. In&#8208;depth characterization of gold precursor &#8208; polymer interactions enabled the rational growth of branched gold nanoparticles on biocompatible hydrogels with different physicochemical properties. In situ seeded growth circumvents traditional limitations imposed by the need of colloidal stability, thereby enabling gold nanoparticle synthesis under surfactant&#8208;free conditions and in high ionic strength solutions, thus enhancing their suitability for applications with live cells. This method can be expanded to create libraries of hybrid plasmonic materials with potential impact in the fabrication of functional 3D cell culture substrates, as well as biological and chemical sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Metalated 1D Perylene Diimide Carbon&#8208;Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H Activation and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal&#8208;coordination site, was synthesized. Post&#8208;synthetic cobalt metalation afforded PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co, which enhanced single oxygen (1O2) generation and electron&#8208;hole pair separation, significantly boosting its photocatalytic performance in &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H activation and CO2 reduction.








Abstract
The photocatalytic activation of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles provides a direct and efficient route to high&#8208;value &#945;&#8208;amino amides but remains challenging due to intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;metalated, one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal coordination site. Cobalt metalation significantly enhances photocatalytic efficiency, enabling the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H carbamoylation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles with yields of up to 91%, far surpassing its non&#8208;metalated counterpart (59%). This enhancement arises from the synergistic interplay between the PDI units and cobalt centers, which promote electron&#8208;hole pair separation and enhance singlet oxygen (1O2) generation. Moreover, PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co exhibits a 57&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity compared to its pristine analogue. This work highlights the critical role of metalation in modulating charge dynamics within COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers insights into the development of next&#8208;generation materials for sustainable catalysis.

Post-synthetic cobalt metalation afforded &lt;b&gt;PP-COF-Co&lt;/b&gt;, which enhanced single oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation and electron-hole pair separation, significantly boosting its photocatalytic performance in &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H activation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic activation of inert C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds in saturated &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles provides a direct and efficient route to high-value &#945;-amino amides but remains challenging due to intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a cobalt-metalated, one-dimensional ABC-stacking covalent organic framework (&lt;b&gt;PP-COF-Co&lt;/b&gt;), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10-phenanthroline as a metal coordination site. Cobalt metalation significantly enhances photocatalytic efficiency, enabling the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H carbamoylation of saturated &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles with yields of up to 91%, far surpassing its non-metalated counterpart (59%). This enhancement arises from the synergistic interplay between the PDI units and cobalt centers, which promote electron-hole pair separation and enhance singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation. Moreover, &lt;b&gt;PP-COF-Co&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a 57-fold increase in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity compared to its pristine analogue. This work highlights the critical role of metalation in modulating charge dynamics within COF-based photocatalysts and offers insights into the development of next-generation materials for sustainable catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Topologically unique, 3D cage&#8208;like noradamantanes are synthesized in one pot from simple starting materials. Catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether, the reaction followed a domino sequence of Michael/epimerization/Michael/1,2&#8208;addition, achieving excellent enantioselectivity. This method formed three C&#9472;C bonds and six chiral centers, including a quaternary all&#8208;carbon center, with five fully stereocontrolled.








Abstract
Topologically unique chiral noradamantanes are synthesized using a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8208;mediated domino Michael/epimerization/Michael/1,2&#8208;addition or Michael/epimerization/aldol/1,2&#8208;addition reaction with excellent enantioselectivity in a single reaction vessel. Three carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are formed, and six chiral centers, including one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, are generated, five of which are fully controlled. These functionalized noradamantanes are 3D, cage&#8208;like molecules that can serve as valuable chiral building blocks for drug design.

         <title>Optimizing the Selectivity of CH4 Electrosynthesis from CO2 Over Cuprates Through Cu&#9472;O Bond Length Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity descriptor based on Cu&#9472;O bond length was established to screen highly selective cuprates toward CH4 electrosynthesis. This descriptor revealed that CH4 selectivity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation with the Cu&#9472;O bond length, with the optimal value accessible at &#8764;1.951&#160;&#197;. Using this descriptor, three new cuprates were predicted, demonstrating better performance compared to the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts in acidic electrolytes.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the nature of Cu&#9472;O bond in Cu&#8208;based oxide catalysts and understanding its correlation with CH4 electrosynthesis (from CO2) for selectivity optimization is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, taking a specific type of cuprates structured with CuO4 square&#8208;planar motifs as the platform, we report a selectivity descriptor of Cu&#9472;O bond length for screening highly selective catalysts toward CH4 electrosynthesis. We establish the descriptor by systematic investigations of several proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cuprates. Their Cu&#9472;O bond lengths are precisely controlled ranging from 1.944 to 1.970&#160;&#197; and these bonds remain stable in CH4 selectivity evaluation. Our investigations demonstrate that the CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Cu&#9472;O bond length, and the optimized value is accessible at about 1.951&#160;&#197;. This could be attributed to the optimal (neither too strong nor too weak) *CO adsorption created by the moderate Cu&#9472;O bond length, facilitating *CO hydrogenation. Furthermore, utilizing this descriptor, we predict three highly selective cuprates for CH4 electrosynthesis, with superior selectivity that is near the top of the volcano plot. And importantly, in an acidic electrolyte (pH&#160;=&#160;1), they outperform the reported catalysts, achieving CH4 selectivity of up to 61.7% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Enhanced p&#8211;d Orbital Coupling in Unconventional Phase RhSb Alloy Nanoflowers for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin rhodium&#8211;antimony alloy nanoflowers with unconventional 2H phase were controllably synthesized via a facile one&#8208;pot method. Benefitting from the enhanced electronic interaction by p&#8211;d orbital coupling, the prepared catalyst delivered an efficient ammonia electrosynthesis capacity in neutral media.








Abstract
Phase control provides a promising approach for physicochemical property modulation of metal/alloy nanomaterials toward various electrocatalytic applications. However, the controlled synthesis of alloy nanomaterials with unconventional phases remains challenging, especially for those containing both p&#8208; and d&#8208;block metals. Here, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ultrathin RhSb alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with an unconventional 2H phase. Using 2H RhSb NFs as an electrocatalyst for nitrite reduction reaction in neutral media, the optimal NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate can reach up to 96.8% and 47.2&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3 and &#8722;0.6&#160;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. With 2H RhSb NFs as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, the as&#8208;assembled zinc&#8208;nitrite/methanol batteries deliver a high energy efficiency of 96.4% and improved rechargeability with 120&#8208;h stable running. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the phase change of RhSb from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to 2H has optimized the electronic structure through stronger interactions between Rh and Sb by p&#8211;d orbital couplings, which improves the adsorption of key intermediates and reduces the reaction barriers of nitrite reduction to guarantee the efficient electrocatalysis. This work offers a feasible strategy of boosting the electrocatalytic performance of alloy nanostructures by integrating phase control and p&#8211;d orbital coupling.

         <title>Functionalized Cyclic Poly(&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids) via Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of O&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic system consisting of a lanthanum complex with a sterically bulky ligand and a manganese silylamide has been developed to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) stereoregular cyclic polyesters and block copolyesters with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#393; &lt;&#160;1.1) and unique physical properties.








Abstract
Linear poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) are important degradable polymers, and they can be efficiently prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides with pendant functional groups. However, attempts to prepare cyclic poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) have been plagued by side reactions, including epimerization and uncontrolled intramolecular chain transfers or termination, that prevent the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight stereoregular cyclic polyesters. Herein, we report a scalable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) stereoregular functionalized cyclic poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) by means of controlled polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides using a catalytic system consisting of a lanthanum complex with a sterically bulky ligand and a manganese silylamide. Additionally, using this system, we could readily prepare cyclic block poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) by means of sequential addition of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides. The obtained cyclic polyesters and their cyclic block copolyesters exhibit distinctive physicochemical properties&#8212;including elevated phase transition temperature, improved toughness, and reduced viscosity&#8212;compared to their linear counterparts.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Strategy Yields Dopant&#8208;Free Small Molecule Hole Transport Materials for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.58% Efficiency and Outstanding Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was used to design two isomeric D&#8211;A&#8211;D small molecules with 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor motifs for dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials in CsPbI&#8323; perovskite solar cells. Structural asymmetry can effectively regulates the dipole moment, energy level alignment, coordination&#8208;active sites, and thereby enabling a record PCE of 20.58% with outstanding stability.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskites are known for their excellent photothermal stability; however, the photothermal stability of all&#8208;inorganic n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is compromised due to ion diffusion and free radical&#8208;induced degradation caused by the use of doped spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport materials (HTMs). In this study, two isomeric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type small molecules, namely HBT and HiBT, were developed and used as dopant&#8208;free HTMs, using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor moieties. The HiBT molecule, with its symmetry&#8208;breaking features, exhibits a large dipole moment, enhanced coordination&#8208;active sites, and a well&#8208;aligned energy level structure, all of which contribute to passivating perovskite surface defects and improving free charge separation. As a result, inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with HiBT HTM achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.58%, the highest reported for dopant&#8208;free HTM&#8208;based inorganic PSCs. Moreover, the enhanced hydrophobic properties of HiBT molecules, coupled with their ability to passivate perovskite surface defects, contribute to significantly improved device stability. The unencapsulated devices based on HiBT HTM retained over 83% and 80% of their initial efficiency after being stored at 85&#160;&#176;C for 50 days and undergoing maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1100 h, respectively. These results highlight that the symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy is an exceptionally effective approach for designing efficient, dopant&#8208;free small molecule HTMs, significantly contributing to both the high efficiency and enhanced stability of all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Ternary Metalation in a Copper&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Tandem Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with efficient synergistic effects for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction is sought&#8208;after yet challenging. Herein, a tandem photocatalytic strategy has been developed through sequential post&#8208;synthetic metalation (SPSM) of variable Ru/Co&#8208;sites into a trinuclear Cu&#8208;based COF, Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, to construct a series of tri&#8208;metallized covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;X (X = 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the Ru: Co molar ratios of 1/39.6, 1/19.6, or 1/12.7, respectively), for photocatalytic CO2 methanation in high selectivity. The introduction of a small fraction of Ru&#8208;sites confers the framework with enhanced visible&#8208;light response, while the Co&#8208;sites immobilized in the bipyridine units significantly boost the generation of CO to enrich its concentration around the active trinuclear Cu&#8208;sites, which enables dramatically improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity toward CH4. Significantly, the optimized Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;2 showcases exceptional photocatalytic activity with CH4 evolution rate of 31.5 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and selectivity of 95%, 15 times higher than that of Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru) merely introducing Ru&#8208;photosensitizer. The underlying photocatalytic mechanism has been studied to unveil how the ternary Ru/Co/Cu&#8208;sites collaborate to result in highly efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, shedding light on the design of highly selective CO2 methanation photocatalyst by leveraging the synergistic effect of multiple active&#8208;centers within heterometallic covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (HM&#8208;COFs).</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelastic with Triclinic&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition Boosts Temperature/Pressure Dual On/Off Switchable Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D hybrid perovskite ferroelastic shows both temperature&#8208; and pressure&#8208;triggered m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase transitions at 296&#160;K and critical pressure of 0.3&#160;GPa, which enables the temperature/pressure dual stimuli induced on/off switching of birefringence between birefringence&#8208;active state in anisotropic ferroelastic P1&#175;$P{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase and birefringence&#8208;inactive state in isotropic paraelastic Fm3&#175;m$Fm{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m$ phase. Such a dual&#8208;stimuli switchable birefringence is unprecedented.








Abstract
Birefringent crystals have gained enormous attention for decades due to their unique ability to manipulate polarized light. However, achieving the fascinating on/off (active/inactive) switchable birefringence under external stimuli in crystals remains a huge challenge, and the stimuli employed have been constrained predominantly to temperature. Here, through H/F substitution, we designed a 3D hybrid double perovskite ferroelastic [C3H5FNH2]2[(NH4)Fe(CN)6] (1&#8208;F), which undergoes a m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m {\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ ferroelastic transition at 296&#160;K, with the highest possible orientation states of 24 among ferroelastic crystals. Notably, the ferroelastic phase transition of 1&#8208;F can also be triggered by pressure with a low critical pressure of &#8764;0.3&#160;GPa. More importantly, 1&#8208;F shows the unprecedented temperature/pressure dual stimuli&#8208;induced on/off switching of birefringence between the birefringence&#8208;active state in the anisotropic triclinic ferroelastic P1&#175;$P{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase and the birefringence&#8208;inactive state in the isotropic cubic paraelastic Fm3&#175;m$Fm{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m$ phase during the m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ ferroelastic transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of dual stimuli&#8208;induced switchable birefringence in crystals. Our work paves a new way for the switching of birefringence and sheds light on the further exploration of switchable birefringence in ferroelastics.

         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been realized under mild conditions, and this method is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$ structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance. This methodology offers novel insights into the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutical compounds and biologically active molecules, as well as the synthesis of difluoro&#8208;containing bioisosteres.








Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine and fluorinated functional groups into organic molecules alters their physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating the advancement of novel therapeutics, agricultural chemicals, biological probes, and materials. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency of methodologies for the catalytic synthesis of certain significant fluorine&#8208;containing groups, such as ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$, under mild conditions utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, we report a method for the regioselective hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under mild conditions with the aid of Ni&#9472;H intermediate catalysis, which is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$ structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Synergistic Solvent and Composition Engineering of Perovskites for Tandems on Industrial Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic solvent and composition engineering (SSCE) strategy has been proposed to regulate the solvated phases and manipulate the transition pathways simultaneously, resulting in suppressed nonradiative recombination and improved phase stability in the mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite film with submicron thickness. This strategy enables the tandems on industrial silicon solar cells to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 31.0%, accompanied by impressive stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites based on mixed formamidinium&#8722;cesium cation and iodide&#8722;bromide halide are promising materials in the top cells that are well&#8208;matched with crystalline silicon bottom cells to construct efficient tandem photovoltaics. Nevertheless, mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite films with submicron film thickness suffer from poor crystallinity with inhomogeneous and undesirable phases, owing to the presence of multiple pathways of crystal nucleation and phase transition. Herein, we propose a synergistic solvent and composition engineering (SSCE) strategy to regulate the solvated phases and manipulate the transition pathways simultaneously. The resultant mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite film shows optimizing crystallization and desired phase structure with suppressed nonradiative recombination and improved phase stability under aging stresses. Consequently, the SSCE strategy enables the tandem cells based on industrially ultrathin silicon wafers (120&#160;&#181;m) to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 31.0%. Those encapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial performance after 1200&#160;h continuous operation.

         <title>Linkages Chemistry of Covalent Organic Frameworks in Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the linkage chemistry of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in fields of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. With different linkages, the relationship between linkages and properties was summarized. The insights into the further development of design strategies and applications based on COFs with different linkages.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis applications due to their structurally ordered architectures and tunable physicochemical properties. In COFs, organic building blocks are linked via covalent bonds, and the structural and electronic characteristics of COFs are critically governed by their linkage chemistry. These linkages influence essential material attributes including surface area, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, chemical stability, and the optoelectronic behavior (e.g., photoelectron separation efficiency, electron conductivity, and reductive activity), which collectively determine catalytic performance in energy conversion systems. A systematic understanding of linkage engineering in COFs not only advances synthetic methodologies but also provides innovative solutions to global energy and environmental challenges, thereby accelerating the development of sustainable technologies for clean energy production and environmental remediation.

         <title>Coupling of CuO@NiBiOx Catalyzed Glycerol Oxidation to Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction for Enhanced Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerol ElectroOxidation Reaction (GEOR) is a promising alternative to the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in electrolyzers, overcoming the inherent challenges of high energy demand and low&#8208;value output of water oxidation. Here, we designed a non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst (CuO@NiBiOx, CNBO) for selective and efficient GEOR. The CNBO&#8208;catalyst demonstrated high selectivity and achieved nearly 100% GEOR Faradaic efficiency (FE), 80% of which is conveyed into formic acid (FA). Bismuth incorporation modified the structure of the mixed oxide, increasing the surface concentration of Ni(III) species and enhancing the GEOR activity. In&#8208;situ studies confirmed the formation of NiOOH, which is identified as the active site for GEOR and suggests an indirect GEOR mechanism. This study demonstrates the potential of GEOR to replace OER in Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrolyzers. Depending on the selected CO2RR catalyst (Ag or Sn), we could obtain either an easy&#8208;to&#8208;separate mixture of high&#8208;added value products (CO and FA) or a single product (FA) with FEFA &gt; 85% at both electrodes. Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing OER with GEOR in a CO2RR&#8208;electrolyzer can save up to 25% of the electrolysis energy input while the co&#8208;production of FA at both electrodes halves the energy per mole required for its electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Cysteines in Proteins Are the Dominant Reductants for Platinum(IV) Prodrug Activation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intracellular reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs is crucial for their anticancer efficacy. However, the major components responsible for the reduction of Pt(IV) complexes within live cells remain elusive. Herein, we developed an aminoluciferin&#8208;functionalized Pt(IV) complex, &#160;Pt&#8208;Luc, that can be used as a bioluminescent reporter for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt(IV) reduction in live cancer cells by capturing immediate bioluminescent signals from the released aminoluciferin. Utilizing this powerful reporter, we found that the reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs in live cancer cells significantly slows down when cysteine levels are reduced, while the levels of glutathione do not impact the reduction rate. Further investigation reveals that reactive cysteines in proteins, rather than small&#8208;molecule thiols, play a primary role in reducing the Pt(IV) complex. In vivo studies reveal a substantial 63% decrease in bioluminescence from Pt&#8208;Luc in thiol&#8208;blocking tumors in mice, reinforcing the pivotal role of reactive cysteines in Pt(IV) reduction. This study provides valuable insights into the activation mechanisms of Pt(IV) prodrugs in live cells and in vivo, enhancing our understanding of prodrug activation beyond buffer systems or fixed cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Glycolysis by Endogenous 31P CEST Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel 3&#185;P CEST method to monitor glycolysis by reducing the detectability threshold of signals of endogenous phosphate&#8208;containing substrates whose direct detection is challenging. In vitro, the method proved to be able to discriminate among breast cancer cells with different aggressiveness, and in vivo, to differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.








Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach to investigate glycolysis by means of the 3&#185;P CEST technique applied to phosphate&#8208;containing substrates at their endogenous concentration. The method relies on the assessment of the saturation transfer (ST) observed on the 3&#185;P signals of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or phosphocreatine (PCr) following the selective irradiation of phosphate groups of endogenous molecules exchanging with ATP, Pi, and indirectly with PCr in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The concentrations of these substrates often fall below the threshold for direct detection. The 3&#185;P CEST technique amplifies their responses, making them detectable via the ST effect to the 3&#185;P resonance of the selected reference signal. The method was first validated in vitro on mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell pellets (TS/A), where the intracellular Pi signal was monitored to assess the ST effect associated with the saturation of phosphoester&#8208;containing molecules. The use of a glycolysis inhibitor and different experimental temperatures (37&#160;&#176;C or 4&#160;&#176;C) provided insights supporting the rationale behind the method. A comparison of 3&#185;P Z&#8208;spectra was carried out on murine breast cancer cell lines with different degrees of aggressiveness, showing the ability to assess metabolic differences. Finally, in vivo experiments on mice models of mammary adenocarcinoma demonstrated that 3&#185;P CEST can differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Optimized Reconstruction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Introduces Cation Vacancies for Selective Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancy engineering was employed to tune the electronic and surface structures of the materials, thereby inhibiting further O&#9472;O bond breakage, which leads to excellent 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance under industrial current density for continuous output of ultra&#8208;high H2O2 concentrations in excess of 8 wt%. This work is expected to provide illuminating insights for the development of efficient 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8211;organic frameworks self&#8208;optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H2O2 under industrial current densities in solid&#8208;electrolyte cell. The ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo electrocatalyst exhibits significant H2O2 selectivity of 97.8%, and the H2O2 productivity is up to 24.53&#160;mol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with a direct and continuous output of &#8764;3.36 wt% H2O2 aqueous solutions under industrial current density (400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Impressively, the ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 220&#160;h and can output H2O2 aqueous solution with a concentration of &#8764;8.03 wt% in the pilot experiment. Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of H2O2 and the rational design of highly active catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Cation vacancy engineering was employed to tune the electronic and surface structures of the materials, thereby inhibiting further O&#9472;O bond breakage, which leads to excellent 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance under industrial current density for continuous output of ultra-high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations in excess of 8 wt%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through the two-electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8211;organic frameworks self-optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under industrial current densities in solid-electrolyte cell.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Photoswitchable Covalent Ligands for the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based design of a covalent photoswitchable ligand for the &#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor, a therapeutically relevant GPCR, is described. This tool facilitates the modification of the intrinsic activity of the protein by light. Computational analysis of its mechanism of action suggests that the photoswitch takes place within the binding pocket. 








Abstract
The &#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) is a critical target for the treatment of airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To better understand its mechanism of action and study its dynamics, photoswitchable ligands provide a distinct advantage due to their ability to be activated with high spatiotemporal control. In this study, we developed a series of molecular tools featuring different combinations of pharmacophores, covalent warheads, and linker lengths. These compounds were characterized using highly specific assay protocols to evaluate their covalent binding capabilities, with the goal of identifying optimal covalently&#8208;bound photoswitches. Among these, the covalently&#8208;bound photoswitchable receptor agonist 6 exhibited a significant functional switch. To gain deeper insight into the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of this molecular tool, as well as the molecular determinants involved, we performed metadynamics (MetaD) simulations and analyzed their results using a Markov State Model (MSM) obtained by applying the Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) principle to the MetaD&#8208;derived free energies. These studies suggest that photoswitching of compound 6 occurs within the binding pocket of the &#946;2AR. Consequently, compound 6 holds promise as a valuable tool for investigating &#946;2AR activation kinetics and dynamics with high accuracy, thereby facilitating high&#8208;resolution biophysical studies.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultra&#8208;Incompressible Beryllium Tungsten Nitride Pernitride BeW10N14(N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary transition metal pernitride was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach starting from W2Be4N5. The structure features not only the rare structural motif of BeN6 octahedra but also dinitrogen anions. DFT calculations reveal ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior of the new compound.








Abstract
For the activation of nitrogen and its reduction to ammonia, transition metals are crucial in biological as well as industrial processes. So far, only a few binary transition metal compounds with nitrogen dimer anions are known, whereas a ternary compound has remained undiscovered as yet. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first ternary transition metal compound, namely, BeW10N14(N2), which exhibits dinitrogen anions. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from W2Be4N5. The crystal structure, elucidated with synchrotron radiation, unites WN7 capped trigonal prisms with intriguing BeN6 octahedra and (N2)&#8208;anions. Elastic and electronic properties of the title compound were corroborated by DFT calculations, revealing simultaneous ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior. The synthesis and investigation of the first ternary transition metal nitride with dinitrogen units opens the door to a new field of research on nitride and pernitride chemistry.

         <title>Chiral Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species for Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral zinc sulfide nanoparticles induced by l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine, as nanodrugs, effectively reduced inflammation and modulated the gut microbiota, which played a significant role in the treatment and prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and provided crucial support for the development of therapeutic strategies for diseases.








Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gut microbiota dysbiosis are crucial factors that exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#160;To address this, we successfully synthesized zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) with a particle size of approximately 500&#160;nm and a maximum g&#8208;factor of 0.07, utilizing l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine as chiral ligands. Chirality gives NPs unique bioactivity. These chiral ZnS NPs could enter macrophages through the CD44 and clathrin pathways, which enhanced the ability to scavenge ROS, in turn significantly inhibited the NF&#8208;&#954;B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;6, and IL&#8208;1&#946;, while upregulating IL&#8208;10. In vivo experimental data showed that l&#8208;ZnS NPs outperformed 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, significantly improving body weight, reducing the IBD activity index, and attenuating tissue damage. Concurrently, l&#8208;ZnS NPs exhibited a marked prophylactic effect. The benchmark studies verified that l&#8208;ZnS NPs increased the abundance of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 by 10.55&#8208;fold and decreased harmful Enterobacter by 2914.00&#8208;fold, thereby reshaping the intestinal microecological balance. Pharmacokinetic and biosafety assessments confirmed the safety of l&#8208;ZnS NPs.&#160;Our findings indicate that chiral ZnS NPs hold great potential as nanodrugs for the treatment and prevention of IBD, providing an important foundation for the development of IBD therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Unraveling the Surface Chemistry of Aluminum Oxo Archimedean Cages for Efficient Serial Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the atomic wonders of aluminum oxo archimedean cages. This study reveals the captivating surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages at the atomic level. The diverse surface chemistry not only showcases the unique properties of these structures but also facilitates efficient solid&#8208;liquid and solid&#8208;gas serial adsorption.








Abstract
Multifunctional materials that meet diverse application needs hold profound significance in resource optimization, efficiency enhancement, and environmental sustainability. However, the development of these materials faces numerous challenges, including raw material acquisition, design feasibility, and long&#8208;term stability. This study demonstrates the innovative application of the surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages in efficient serial adsorption. The &#8220;Four&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; surface chemistry enables various single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) structural transformations, involving ligand modification, cation exchange, post&#8208;synthetic metalation, and metal elimination, successfully achieving the first reversible SC&#8208;SC transformation from cluster structures to infinite frameworks. The fundamental reason behind these dynamic structural changes lies in the exceptional balance between rigidity and flexibility provided by the intercluster tri&#8208;pyrazole sites on the Archimedean cages. This diverse structural transformation characteristic offers extensive application potential for solid&#8208;liquid and solid&#8208;gas serial adsorption. For instance, this material effectively adsorbs heavy metal ions in water treatment and can subsequently be used for the permanent fixation of gaseous radionuclides. This work not only deepens our understanding of dynamic chemistry but also provides guiding significance for environmental remediation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unveiling the atomic wonders of aluminum oxo archimedean cages&lt;/b&gt;. This study reveals the captivating surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages at the atomic level. The diverse surface chemistry not only showcases the unique properties of these structures but also facilitates efficient solid-liquid and solid-gas serial adsorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional materials that meet diverse application needs hold profound significance in resource optimization, efficiency enhancement, and environmental sustainability. However, the development of these materials faces numerous challenges, including raw material acquisition, design feasibility, and long-term stability. This study demonstrates the innovative application of the surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages in efficient serial adsorption. The &#8220;Four-in-One&#8221; surface chemistry enables various single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) structural transformations, involving ligand modification, cation exchange, post-synthetic metalation, and metal elimination, successfully achieving the first reversible SC-SC transformation from cluster structures to infinite frameworks. The fundamental reason behind these dynamic structural changes lies in the exceptional balance between rigidity and flexibility provided by the intercluster tri-pyrazole sites on the Archimedean cages. This diverse structural transformation characteristic offers extensive application potential for solid-liquid and solid-gas serial adsorption. For instance, this material effectively adsorbs heavy metal ions in water treatment and can subsequently be used for the permanent fixation of gaseous radionuclides. This work not only deepens our understanding of dynamic chemistry but also provides guiding significance for environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photoconversion of a Discrete Mixed Iodine(I) System to a 1D Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex, which contained three distinct iodine(I) moieties, was synthesized using 4&#8208;styrylpyridine and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate. This complex underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to UV light, converting the discrete salt to a 1D polymer while retaining the iodine(I) moieties and represents the only example of a nondestructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex.








Abstract
The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex (2), containing three distinct iodine(I) moieties ([N&#8213;I&#8213;N]+, O&#8213;I&#8213;N, and [O&#8213;I&#8213;O]&#8722;) within the same structure, was synthesized with 4&#8208;styrylpyridine (4&#8208;stypy) and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate as the stabilizing Lewis bases. This complex was observed to be in equilibrium with its respective bis(OIN) complex (1a), with isolated samples of 2 also being found to convert to 1a in solution. Upon UV irradiation of 2, a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction was observed, converting the discrete salt 2 to the 1D polymer 5. Complex 5 retained all the iodine(I) moieties from prior to photoconversion and represents the first example of nondestructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex. To facilitate comparisons to 2 and 5, several additional closely related iodine(I) complexes were synthesized, with the iodine(I) complexes characterized by NMR (1H, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC) and SCXRD, as well as by Raman and IR spectroscopy for 2, 5, and their close structural analogue 1a.

         <title>Balancing Intermediates Formation on Atomically Pd&#8208;Bridged Cu/Cu2O Interfaces for Kinetics&#8208;Matching Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O catalyst with atomically Pd&#8208;bridged Cu/Cu2O interfaces was designed for efficient electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling reaction. The active Cu&#8211;Pd dual sites effectively balance the formation of C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediates and significantly lower the energy barrier for C&#9472;N coupling, thereby enhancing the synthesis of urea.








Abstract
The electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling of CO2 and nitrogenous species provides a promising approach for synthesizing valuable chemicals such as urea, amides, and other C&#9472;N compounds. However, the unbalanced formation of C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediates results in slow C&#9472;N coupling kinetics. Herein, we report an atomically Pd&#8208;bridged Cu/Cu2O (Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O) catalyst, synthesized through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Pd1&#8211;Cu2Te nanosheets. This catalyst features Pd&#8211;Cu dual sites that significantly enhance C&#9472;N coupling both thermodynamically and kinetically. The reconstructed Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O achieves a urea yield rate of 31.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 42.2%, along with excellent stability over 100&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic examinations and theoretical calculations disclose that the Pd&#8211;Cu dual sites on Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O modulate the reduction kinetics of CO2 and NO3&#8722;, balance the formation of crucial *CO and *NH2 intermediates, and lower the energy barrier for C&#9472;N coupling, thereby facilitating urea synthesis. Furthermore, the Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O enables the unprecedented C&#9472;N coupling of aniline with CO, resulting in a remarkable acetanilide yield rate of 1021.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 with an FE of 23.7%. This heteroatom bridging strategy offers a new pathway for designing efficient electrocatalyst for the synthesis of C&#9472;N coupled compounds.

         <title>Harnessing Biofilm Scaffold for Structurally Adaptative Slippery Surfaces with Integrated Antifouling and Anticorrosion Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept derived from biofilm scaffolds is proposed to develop universal, flexible, and multifunctional nonstick coatings with autophobicity. These cohesive biofilms acting as structurally adaptive sheets enable scalable and substrate&#8208;independent self&#8208;cleaning capabilities without compromising transparency and mechanical stability. This coating significantly enhances corrosion resistance and prevents a broad spectrum of biofouling attachments.








Abstract
Artificial liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are highly desirable to combat pervasive biofouling and corrosion in biological environments. However, existing strategies often suffer from slow binding kinetics and harsh fabrication conditions, hindering the concurrent integration of liquid repellency, universal adhesion, and robust flexibility. Herein, we report that it is possible to engineer microbial biofilms as eco&#8208;friendly, cohesive, and flexible materials for omniphobic slippery coatings fulfilling all these requirements. Unlike conventional synthetic slippery coatings requiring laborious surface pretreatments, biofilm sheets formed on demand assemble a durable nanotextured framework on diverse substrates with multiple material categories and surface topologies, serving as hydrophobic lubricant reservoirs. Employing this renewable material enables the scalable and sustainable coating production. The resulting optically transparent and highly flexible coatings manifest exceptional self&#8208;cleaning properties, readily shedding both waterborne and oily liquids over a broad viscosity range. Notably, the synergy between the corrosion&#8208;protective extracellular matrix and nonstick slipping motion confers unprecedented antibiofouling efficacy and corrosion resistance. This study offers a distinctive perspective on harnessing ubiquitous native biofilms as biomaterials for self&#8208;adaptive coatings, facilitating tailored functionality across broad applications.

         <title>Blocking the Operando Formation of Single&#8208;Atom Spectators by Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redispersion of Pt ensembles and the formation of single&#8208;atom species are key factors in the deactivation of CeO2&#8208;supported Pt catalysts for propane oxidation. We propose an interfacial engineering strategy using NbOx to block binding sites for Pt on CeO2, directing Pt clusters to optimal locations without direct contact. This approach prevents redispersion, enabling active Pt nanoclusters to efficiently dissociate C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in a 37&#8208;fold increase in reaction rate and enhanced stability. 








Abstract
Aside from activity and selectivity, catalyst stability is a key focus in heterogeneous catalysis research. Although sintering of metal species has been considered the primary cause for deactivation of metal catalysts, our study reveals that the loss of activity at low reaction temperatures in the CeO2&#8208;supported Pt (Pt/CeO2) catalyst in complete propane oxidation is due to the dispersion of Pt ensemble sites (nanoclusters) and their subsequent operando conversion into Pt single atoms under reaction conditions. These Pt single&#8208;atom species exhibit low reactivity and act as spectators in the low&#8208;temperature reaction region. To address this issue, we engineered the surface of CeO2 by introducing NbOx, which does not directly interact with Pt. Instead, NbOx blocks the strong binding sites for Pt on CeO2, thereby preventing Pt redispersion/fragmentation and preserving reactive Pt ensembles. This strategy led to a remarkable 37&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate compared to the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Our findings emphasize the importance of suppressing the formation of noble metal single&#8208;atom spectators through innovative surface engineering strategy. These mechanistic insights not only advance the understanding of the materials science of Pt/CeO2 but also extend to critical technological fields such as energy conversion systems and environmental remediation technologies.

To address this issue, we engineered the surface of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by introducing NbO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, which does not directly interact with Pt. Instead, NbO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; blocks the strong binding sites for Pt on CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby preventing Pt redispersion/fragmentation and preserving reactive Pt ensembles. This strategy led to a remarkable 37-fold increase in the reaction rate compared to the Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. Our findings emphasize the importance of suppressing the formation of noble metal single-atom spectators through innovative surface engineering strategy. These mechanistic insights not only advance the understanding of the materials science of Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also extend to critical technological fields such as energy conversion systems and environmental remediation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exceptionally High Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Cross Sections&#160;in Quinoidal Diazaacene&#8208;Bithiophene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking new horizons in two&#8208;photon absorption, this study uncovers how specially structured quinoidal&#8208;bithiophene derivatives achieve remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections&#160;in the near&#8208;infrared range. Advanced calculations reveal the interplay of molecular symmetry and strong state coupling, shedding light on the mechanism behind their efficiency&#8212;potentially transforming fields like bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, and optical data storage.








Abstract
This study addresses the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties of (azaacene&#8208;annulated) heterophenoquinones through a synergistic approach combining detailed experimental and theoretical analyses. Exceptionally large 2PA cross sections&#160;are found over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, with values up to 4100 GM in the 1400&#8211;1600&#160;nm range and even higher values of up to 51770&#160;GM in the 850&#8211;950&#160;nm range, which is outstanding for organic chromophores of this molecular size. Our quantum chemical calculations support the experimental findings and elucidate the underlying absorption mechanism leading to the corresponding 2PA properties. The occurrence of such large cross sections&#160;is explained by the high oscillator strength of the first excited singlet state and its strong coupling to higher excited electronic states. The large (state&#8208;to&#8208;state) transition dipole moments originate from the acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor structure of the parent quinoidal bithiophene motif common to all compounds, which in addition also enables their optimal (anti)parallel alignment due to its symmetry and&#160;linearity.

         <title>Tandem Biocatalysis to Generate Hydrogen Sulfide and Promote Endogenous Antioxidant Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy where we integrated spatially and temporally controlled catalysis in one system to promote antioxidant response is reported. We developed a glycoconjugate that is cleaved sequentially by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST) to produce potent antioxidants persulfide and hydrogen sulfide, and this compound was found to mitigate inflammation in an animal model.








Abstract
Promoting cellular protective responses during oxidative stress conditions through the generation of antioxidant persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report a bioinspired glycoconjugate, a candidate for tandem biocatalysis and generates persulfide/ H2S in response to oxidative stress. The glycoconjugate is cleaved by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, an enzyme that is expressed during oxidative stress; the product of this reaction is a substrate for 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme that is involved in persulfide/ H2S biosynthesis. The catalytic systems are orthogonal to one another, and the glycoconjugate is efficiently cleaved by these enzymes to generate the potent antioxidant glutathione persulfide as well as H2S. We demonstrate the efficacy of this conjugate in mitigating inflammation in the brain in an animal model. Together, using rationally designed substrates and fully catalytic steps, we leverage tandem biocatalysis to direct the generation of persulfide/ H2S, and promote cells&#8217; own antioxidant response.

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via a one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8208;3.91 eV for PQD, &#8208;3.73 eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and to eventually n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8208;1 and power factor of 36.7 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potentials of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Cation&#8208;Chloride Co&#8208;transporters for Chloride&#8208;Facilitated Lithium/Magnesium Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by nature, many artificial ion sieving materials have been developed, shedding light on the next&#8208;generation ion, e.g., Li+, extraction applications. Artificial co&#8208;transporters remain notoriously difficult to construct since they have a much more complex ion sieving property. For example, the cation&#8208;chloride co&#8208;transporters have both alkaline ion and chloride ion selectivity but no alkaline ion/chloride ion selectivity. We here demonstrate a method to construct artificial co&#8208;transporters, using a &#160;porous organic framework membrane which has relatively disordered stacking structure and rich quaternary ammonium groups paired with counter&#8208;ions. This imparts the membrane with extremely narrow pores (~0.3 nm) and almost no surface charge, enabling size&#8208;based high alkaline ion selectivity against other cations, high Cl&#8208; selectivity against other anions, but almost no alkaline ion/Cl&#8208; selectivity. Such synchronized sieving property further allows us to enhance the extraction of high&#8208;value cations (Li+) by simply feeding excessive low&#8208;value anions (Cl&#8208;). As a demonstration, we realized high&#8208;flux (0.44 mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1, driven by only concentration gradient) and highly selective (selectivity: 185) Li+/Mg2+ separation by reversing the current industrial brine&#8208;based lithium extraction process, i.e., sieving Li+ before removing NaCl.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Oxide&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Design for Syngas Conversion by Reaction Phase Diagram Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept provides an alternative approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) with superior selectivity. Enhancing the activity of oxide components remains a critical and long&#8208;pursued target in this field. However, rational design strategies for optimizing oxides and improving the catalyst performance in such complex reaction networks are still lacking. We employed energetic descriptors such as the adsorption energies of CO* and O* (GadCO* and GadO*) through reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis to predict the catalyst performance. The prediction was initially validated by the catalytic activity trends measured by experiments. Machine learning (ML) was further utilized to accelerate the screening of new catalysts. Ultimately, Bi&#8208;doped and Sb&#8208;doped ZnCrOx were theoretically predicted as optimized oxide candidates for the OXZEO reaction, which was experimentally verified to be more active than the currently best ZnCrOx counterpart. This work demonstrated enhanced OXZEO catalysts for STO as well as a research paradigm integrating theory and experiment to optimize bifunctional catalysts for complex reaction networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Polyorganosiloxanes via Photo&#8208;induced Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Using A Latent Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise, controlled, and living polymerization of cyclosiloxanes is garnering considerable attention due to&#160;distinct properties and promising applications of polyorganosiloxanes in various fields. In this contribution, photo&#8208;induced living anionic ring opening polymerization of cyclosiloxanes is achieved by developing an efficient photobase generator (PBG). Structure&#8208;photoactivity analysis of the photo&#8208;latent catalyst is undertaken by synergistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental investigations. DFT calculations predict the superior photoactivity of the synthesized PBG2 (i.e., 2&#8208;[(9&#8208;oxo&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)oxy]acetic&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;riazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) and provide insight into the structure&#8208;catalytic activities, which is confirmed though the experiments. Polysiloxanes with predetermined molar masses and low dispersities (&#272; &lt; 1.30) are produced through on&#8208;demand cleavage of PBG2 under various light intensities, different PBG2 loadings, and sequential addition of monomers. On&#8208;off light switching enables the polymerization in a rate&#8208;controlled manner. Later on, mechanistic insights by using DFT calculations identify the anionic species for nucleophilic attack and reveal that the reversible equilibrium involving anionic species, catalyst cations, and ion pair contribute to precise control over chain growth during photopolymerization. Furthermore, deterministic kinetic simulation disentangles the effects of the cleavage rate and loading of PBG2 on polymerization kinetic behaviors. This developed photopolymerization strategy shows promising potential to expand the application of polyorganosilicon in advanced manufacturing fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Catch, Cut, or Block? &#8211; Versatile 4&#8208;N&#8208;Derivatized Sialyl Glycosides for Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Detection and Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seasonal influenza continues to threaten human lives and pose a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy, emphasizing the need for developing better influenza vaccines, diagnostics, and anti&#8208;viral therapeutics. To address these challenges, we generated a library of structurally diverse sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy. Sialosides containing 4&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted sialic acid were selectively cleaved by sialidases from influenza viruses, whereas sialosides containing 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid were resistant to sialidase cleavage. Interestingly, sialosides containing 4&#8208;amino&#8208; or 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid were effective inhibitors moderately or highly resistant to cleavage by influenza sialidases (also called neuraminidases). The sialosides containing the 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid represent a new class of sialidase substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors. We took advantage of this unique property to create a ligand&#8208;based approach for efficiently isolating influenza virions from egg allantoic fluid with high purity. Together, these compounds are versatile probes and ligands for developing new approaches to detect, profile, isolate, and characterize influenza viruses via neuraminidases on their surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzotrifuran&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2 from H2O, O2 and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important green chemical and a potential energy carrier. Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2&#160;from only H2O and O2&#160;under sunlight is a fascinating and sustainable tactic. However, deficient proton sources come from the kinetically sluggish H2O oxidation process (~s) seriously impede half&#8208;reaction of O2&#160;reduction (&#956;s~ms), leading to inferior photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we prepare a benzotrifuran&#8208;based covalent organic framework featuring electron donor&#8208;acceptor character with hydrazone linkage. Spatially&#160;separated donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;stacking columns offer rich O2&#160;reduction and H2O oxidation active sites, also serve as channels for photoinduced charge separation and transport. Importantly, the one&#8208;dimensional pore containing abundant heteroatoms facilitates&#160;H2O delivery to oxidation sites and reduces reaction energy barrier, thus improving the kinetic of H2O oxidation. Accordingly, this porous framework achieves efficient H2O2&#160;photocatalysis with an average mass rate of up to 6432&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from H2O and O2&#160;in the absence of any sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight by balancing O2&#160;reduction and H2O oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ketone&#8211;Accepting Pictet&#8208;Spenglerase for the Asymmetric Construction of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydro&#8208;&#223;&#8208;Carboline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In light of the ubiquity of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carboline (THBC) motif in alkaloid natural products, developing asymmetric methodology for its preparation is highly valuable. Despite the immense progress towards achieving stereoselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction with aldehydes, the analogous reaction with ketones is still underdeveloped. Exploiting KslB, a Pictet&#8208;Spenglerase from the biosynthesis of kitasetaline, we develop a general, diastereoselective, and protecting&#8208;group free method for the construction of densely functionalized THBCs with &#945;&#8208;quaternary center by coupling tryptophan derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids. We determine the stereochemistry of kitasetalic acid, KslB&#8217;s physiological product and a key biosynthetic intermediate towards kitasetaline, and established that KslB&#8217;s selectivity is opposite to what is achieved chemically. Our investigations of KslB show its high activity (total turnover number &gt;438,000), substrate promiscuity, and tolerance for high substrate concentrations (0.1M). Additionally, a TrpB&#8208;KslB cascade enables the construction of complex tricyclic products from simple indoles in one&#8208;pot. X&#8208;ray structural characterization of KslB sheds light on potential active site interactions to account for its stereoselectivity and ability to accept ketone substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sensitive RNAs Using Fluoride&#8208;Cleavable Groups as Linkers and Amino&#8208;Group Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemical method suitable for the synthesis of RNAs containing modifications such as N4&#8208;acetylcytidine (ac4C) that are unstable under the&#160;nucleophilic conditions used by standard RNA synthesis methods is described. The method uses the 4&#8208;((t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methoxybutanoyl (SoM) group for the protection of exo&#8208;amino groups of nucleobases and the 4&#8208;((t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)&#8208;2&#8208;((aminophosphaneyl)oxy)butanoyl (SoA) group as the linker for solid phase synthesis. RNA cleavage and amino deprotection are achieved using fluoride under the same conditions used for the removal of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH silyl protecting groups. Using this method, a wide range of electrophilic and base&#8208;sensitive groups including those that play structural and regulatory roles in biological systems and those that are artificially designed for various purposes are expected to be able to be incorporated into any position of any RNA sequences. As a proof of concept, several RNAs containing the highly sensitive ac4C epitranscriptomic modification was synthesized and purified with RP HPLC. MALDI MS analysis indicated that the ac4C modification is completely stable under the fluoride deprotection conditions. The sensitive RNA synthesis method is expected to be able to overcome the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of accessing various modified sensitive RNAs to projects in areas such as epitranscriptomics, molecular biology and the development of nucleic acid therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;controlled Release of Urea Enables the Detection of Urea&#8208;Urease Intermediates by cryo&#8208;FTIR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caged compounds are a valuable tool to photocontrol the release of enzymatic substrates in a reaction. For example, caged urea molecules were proposed to control urea delivery to urease reactions and aid the determination of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Owing to the success of several caged compounds based on ruthenium complexes, we synthesized a new inorganic caged urea (RuBpy&#8208;urea) and monitored the release of free urea by infrared spectroscopy upon irradiation. Transient infrared absorption (TRIR) indicates diffusion&#8208;controlled release of urea, and kinetics studies after photolysis demonstrate the functionality of the new caged molecule for photo&#8208;controlled delivery of urea to urease. Coupling photo&#8208;controlled delivery of urea to cryo&#8208;FTIR revealed that inhibition of urease results in different FTIR spectrum than the one observed for the non&#8208;inhibited urease.</dc:description>

Transient infrared absorption (TRIR) indicates diffusion-controlled release of urea, and kinetics studies after photolysis demonstrate the functionality of the new caged molecule for photo-controlled delivery of urea to urease. Coupling photo-controlled delivery of urea to cryo-FTIR revealed that inhibition of urease results in different FTIR spectrum than the one observed for the non-inhibited urease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Convex Edge Site in Fully&#8208;Exposed Pt Cluster Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a precisely understanding of the active site structure has long been an ultimate goal in fundamental heterogeneous catalysis research, yet it remains exceptionally challenging in nanocluster catalysis. In Pt&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexane dehydrogenation for liquid organic carriers (LOHC), previous efforts have provided valuable insights into the size effects of nanoclusters. However, the optimal geometry of the active sites remained elusive and, at times, contradictory. In this study, we investigate the geometric effect and the active site structure in fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters supported on ceria that exhibit superior activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation (11.4 mol&#183;molPt&#8315;&#185;&#183;s&#8315;&#185;), characterized by small coordination numbers, high metal utilization efficiency, and abundant convex edge sites. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters outperform other active structures (e.g. terrace sites, hollow sites, etc.) in dehydrogenation reactions. These convex edge sites are not only efficient in C&#8208;H activation but, more notably, are resistant to detrimental carbonous intermediates, hence enabling high and long&#8208;lived H2 production activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending Frontier Molecular Orbitals Delocalization via Donor Fusion: Construct Long&#8208;Wavelength Twisted Multiple Resonance Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising candidates for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays employing organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, we propose a general strategy for post&#8208;functionalizing MR core, introducing donors on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position via Suzuki coupling and then fusing the donors to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position via intramolecular Scholl cyclization, which can effectively extend frontier molecular orbitals delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed, achieving large spectral red&#8208;shifts while maintaining narrowband emission. The distorted configuration resulting from the hetero[8]helicene structure introduces twisted &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, which effectively enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), ultimately enabling molecule BN&#8208;PhAzCz to achieve a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC = 6.4 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1) without the participation of heavy atoms. BN&#8208;PhAzCz&#8208;based single&#8208;host OLED exhibits green emission at 528 nm with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2% with efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 under 5 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 29.6% with little change in the spectral profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetically Enhanced Access to a Dynamic Polyester Platform via Sequence Selective Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, contains preformed dynamic Sulfur&#8208;Sulfur bonds promising to impart dynamicity onto polymers obtained from this monomer. Yet robust methodologies to access linear polymers with tuneable properties and functionality are rare. Addressing these problems, we here report a rare sequence selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulfur with aromatic thioanhydrides and epoxides under simple lithium alkoxide catalysis yields semi&#8208;aromatic Poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx). This enables access to terpolymers from a greatly improved range of epoxide comonomers compared to previous methodologies, including industrially relevant, flexible, rigid, functional and natural product derived variants allowing to tune glass transition temperatures across a Tg range of &gt;150&#176;C. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the insertion of S8 leads to an unusual rate acceleration via coordinative participation of the polyester links sitting adjacent to the propagating chain&#8208;end. The thermal stability of the polymers allows for post polymerisation backbone modification via &#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208; bond metathesis. After crosslinking these can be applied as thermally reprocessable and acid degradable adhesives, the performance of which can be enhanced via backbone editing. Our contribution paves the way for the rational buildup of diverse and functional polymer structures from elemental sulfur waste enabled by mechanistic understanding.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic Interacting Protein Stabilization for Orthogonal RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Live imaging of RNAs is crucial to interrogate their cellular functions, but genetically encodable RNA imaging system compatible to multiplexed and in vivo&#160;applications remains a persistent challenge.&#160;We propose a new concept of fluorogenic interacting protein stabilization (FLIPS) that enables engineering of RNA&#8208;binding&#160;proteins&#160;(RBPs) such as MCP, L7Ae, Cse3&#160;and LIN28A into orthogonal RNA&#8208;stabilized fluorogenic proteins for multiplexed RNA imaging. The FLIPS system comprises elaborate engineering of the fluorescence protein&#8208;fused RBPs through circular permutation and incorporation with a C&#8208;terminal poly(arginine)&#8208;appended degron. We show that the RNA motifs bind and stabilize the cognate engineered RBPs with a proximity&#8208;mediated synergistic effect from the poly(arginine) region due to enhanced electrostatic interactions.&#160;The FLIPS&#160;design affords a generally applicable strategy for different RNA motifs and RBPs, enabling orthogonal and multi&#8208;color fluorescence&#8208;activated RNA imaging. The design is demonstrated for multicolor and orthogonal imaging of RNAs, single molecule RNA imaging and tracking, simultaneous imaging of two RNAs in nuclear condensates, and biplexed tracking of RNA translocation into cytosolic condensates. The versatility of our system highlights its potential for interrogating RNA biology and developing RNA&#8208;based imaging tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Thermally and Photochemically Immobilized N&#8208;type Conjugated Polymer Films via Quantitative Backbone Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A postpolymerization modification (PPM) of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers by nucleophilic aromatic substitution is reported, enabling precise tuning of solubility, ordering, and stability. The method allows the facile introduction of azide groups, which can undergo UV&#8208; or thermally induced crosslinking, to afford stable, insoluble films with retained electron transport in transistor devices.








Abstract
We report a series of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers based on PNDI&#8208;TfBTT and PNDIV&#8208;TfBTT backbones constructed from electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene diimide (NDI) and fluorinated benzothiadiazole (fBT) units, with PNDIV&#8208;TfBTT incorporating a vinylene spacer. Quantitative postpolymerization modification (PPM) via nucleophilic substitution replaced the fBT fluorine with thioether side chains, optionally containing azide groups. Thioether substitution improved solubility, while subtly changing the ordering of polymer films. Azide incorporation enabled both thermal and photochemical crosslinking, yielding insoluble and immobile films that retained good electron transport; although UV crosslinking initially reduced mobility, subsequent thermal annealing largely restored crystallinity and performance. This work underscores the utility of precise backbone editing to fine&#8208;tune the electronic and morphological properties of n&#8208;type polymers, offering new avenues for the fabrication of stable, patterned active layers in advanced organic electronic devices.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Substituted Porous C2N Frameworks as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;substituted porous C2N framework (O&#9472;C2N) catalyst with fine&#8208;tailored N&#9472;C&#9472;O configurations is fabricated through a thermal condensation method, which is directly applied for efficient CO2 electroreduction with a CO selectivity up to 94.8%. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the well&#8208;defined C&#9472;O&#9472;C active moieties and CO selectivity is established.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a green avenue for decarbonizing the conventional chemical industries.

&lt;p&gt;An oxygen-substituted porous C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N framework (O&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N) catalyst with fine-tailored N&#9472;C&#9472;O configurations is fabricated through a thermal condensation method, which is directly applied for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction with a CO selectivity up to 94.8%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) provides a green avenue for decarbonizing the conventional chemical industries. Here, a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship of catalysts is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathway. We report the fabrication of an oxygen-substituted C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N as metal-free catalyst (O&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N) for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;to&#9472;CO conversion with tunable O microenvironment. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored N&#9472;C&#9472;O moiety in O&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, where C&#9472;O&#9472;C species (e.g., ring in-plane ether) become the dominant oxygen configurations at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on experimental observations, a correlation between the exocyclic O-substituted N&#9472;C&#9472;O&#9472;C moieties and CO selectivity is established, giving clear chemical tools for active structure design.

         <title>Allenylidene Phosphonium Ion: An Isoelectronic Phosphorus Analogue of [3]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first isolobal and isoelectronic incorporation of a phosphorus atom into a [3]cumulene. This trigonal planar phosphonium allenylidene demonstrates exceptional Lewis acidity via a &#960;* acceptor orbital and exhibits unique reactivity through a reversible intramolecular dearomative [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, and bonding analysis of a crystalline allenylidene phosphonium ion ([R2P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;CAr2]+) [2]+ (R&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;diisopropylphenylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino, CAr2&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenylidene), an isolobal analogue of [3]cumulenes. The cation was prepared via methoxide ion abstraction of an alkynyl phosphine 1. Electron rich N&#8208;heterocyclic imine substituents and a &#960; conjugated fluorenyl scaffold together stabilize the resulting three&#8208;coordinate phosphonium center of [2]+. [2]+ features a trigonal planar phosphorus atom which is electrophilic, as evidenced experimentally by the preparation of a Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine, and fluoride ion affinity calculations. Crystallographic and computational investigations of [2]+ support a structure with considerable P&#9552;C double bond character. Furthermore, this P&#9552;C double bond participates in a thermally reversible intramolecular dearomative [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with an arene moiety of one of its supporting 1,3&#8208;diisopropylphenylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino substituents to give a tetracyclic isomer [2cyclo]+. The isolation of a free [R2P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;CAr2]+ draws further parallels between the properties and reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate phosphorus compounds and related carbon compounds.

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration Dominates Anomalous Reversible Oxidation of Ru Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the common perception that metal oxidation is a unidirectional process, the oxidation of Ru nanosheets is reversible under oxidative conditions. This reversibility originates from the ability of O atoms to &#8220;flow&#8221; across Ru layers, which serves as the underlying mechanism for the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets.








Abstract
Oxidation is a ubiquitous reaction in nature. For most metals (especially metal nanoparticles [NPs]), they will be completely oxidized under suitable conditions, except ruthenium (Ru). In this work, in situ transmission electron microscopy (in situ TEM) and ex situ spectroscopy were employed to investigate the oxidation process of Ru nanosheets. Ex situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets to RuO&#8322;, while the in situ TEM observations uncover an anomalous reverse phase transformation from the oxidized to metallic phase during oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the oxygen atom migration dominates the reversible oxidation process, strikingly distinct from the unidirectional oxidation pathways in conventional metallic systems. The as&#8208;generated abundant Ru&#9472;RuO2 heterointerfaces formed through reversible oxidation provide a wealth of active sites for electrochemical alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the study not only lays a foundation for the understanding complex dynamic oxidation processes, but also offers new insights into the design of nanocatalysts.

         <title>Indirect Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalization of Terminal Alkenes via an Alkenyl Thianthrenium Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage dication pool strategy using alkenyl thianthrenium intermediates has been developed for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization. This method differs from previous approaches in its reaction mechanism and addresses their most significant limitation, namely, the restricted generality of the nucleophile. The approach has been extended to other challenging transformations, including anti&#8208;Wacker&#8208;type oxidation, hydroacetylenation, hydrogenation, and deuterium labeling.








Abstract
The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal, unactivated olefins is an evergreen synthetic challenge in organic chemistry. Several direct and indirect anti&#8208;Markovnikov methods have been developed, ranging from the classical hydroboration/oxidation protocol to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoredox catalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed, and enzymatic procedures. Despite the ever&#8208;expanding suite of synthetic capabilities, these methods still have limited generality in their substrate scope, especially with nucleophiles. Herein, we show that terminal, unactivated olefins can be transformed into anti&#8208;Markovnikov products via an alkenyl thianthrenium intermediate that undergoes sequential hydride and nucleophile addition. The strategic advantage of this method lies in the ability to utilize a diverse array of oxidatively sensitive nucleophiles as reaction partners. This is accomplished through a mechanistically distinct, two&#8208;stage dication pool anti&#8208;Markovnikov approach, where separate oxidative olefin activation by thianthrenation is followed by the selective generation of a reactive alkyl thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Manipulation of Chemistry and Biology with Visible Light Using Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes and Azonium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Azobenzenes (TOABs) in broad daylight: in recent years, TOAB photoswitches became indispensable tools for all&#8208;visible&#8208;light manipulation of chemistry, biology and materials. This review explores their unique photochemical properties, design and synthetic approaches, offering support in choosing a TOAB for a given application.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches are used for precise and reversible control over the properties and function of chemical, biological and material systems, offering exceptional spatiotemporal control. Their current development focuses on enabling operation with non&#8208;damaging and deep tissue penetrating visible/near&#8208;IR light. In this context, tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions play a leading role, thanks to their unique photophysical properties and easily modifiable structure. However, it is only recently that synthetic approaches to those sterically demanding systems have been established and their structure&#8208;photochemistry relations have been understood to provide general rules for their tuning to a given application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of this family of molecular photoswitches, providing an analysis of their photophysical properties, followed by a discussion of the available synthetic methodologies. Finally, we showcase the versatility of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions for enabling light&#8208;control in biological and material sciences, providing multiple insights for future applications.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence&#8208;Enabled Quantitative Assessment and Intervention for Heart Inflammation Model Organoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammation plays a crucial role in progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), thus the discovery of rapid and precise analytical tools to assess inflammation related to CVDs is highly desirable for its diagnosis and therapeutics discovery. However, a straightforward and systematic method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in heart organoids has yet to be developed. Herein, we describe the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial intelligent (AI)&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright and Versatile Azetidinecarboxamide&#8208;Based Fluorophore&#8211;Ligand Conjugates for High&#8208;Resolution Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azetidinecarboxamide substitution enhances fluorophore brightness and provides an integrated reactive site for ligand conjugation. This dual&#8208;function design streamlines the synthesis of fluorophore&#8211;ligand conjugates, enabling rapid, efficient, and modular probe development for biological imaging.








Abstract
Fluorophore&#8211;ligand conjugates play a pivotal role in cellular imaging, providing high target specificity. However, simultaneously achieving conjugates with high brightness and ligand&#8208;targeting diversity presents significant challenges. Traditional strategies often require complex, multistep modifications for fluorophore enhancement and ligand conjugation. Here, we present an azetidinecarboxamide strategy that addresses these challenges by integrating brightness enhancement and ligand conjugation capabilities within a single molecular framework. The azetidinecarboxamide core suppresses twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thereby enhancing fluorescence quantum yield. Its carbonyl group provides a versatile site for conjugating a wide range of targeting ligands, enabling the rapid development of diverse and tunable fluorophore&#8211;ligand conjugates. This streamlined approach reduces synthetic complexity, accelerates probe development, and is compatible with a wide variety of fluorophores, such as coumarin, naphthalimide, NBD, rhodol, rhodamine, and silicon&#8211;rhodamine, facilitating the creation of high&#8208;performance, multifunctional probes for advanced cellular imaging.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Euphane Triterpenoids Using Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate undergoes metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer, yielding unprecedented cyclization products via alkene cycloisomerization or cyclization&#8208;elimination pathways. This methodology enables an efficient synthetic strategy to deliver four natural products: euphol, 25,26,27&#8208;trisnor&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;euphan&#8208;24&#8208;al, euphorbiumrin D, and 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;tirucall&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione.








Abstract
Euphane triterpenoids are widely distributed in nature and show various intriguing bioactivities, but relatively few synthetic routes to them have been described. Here, we report asymmetric convergent total syntheses of euphanes involving two triterpenoids and two nortriterpenoids: euphol, 25,26,27&#8208;trisnor&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;euphan&#8208;24&#8208;al, euphorbiumrin D, and 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;tirucall&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The syntheses employ an enantioselective Antilla allylboration and intramolecular radical cyclization to construct ring A, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Liebeskind stannane&#8208;thioester coupling to connect ring A with the bicyclic CD system, and a novel radical cascade with metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) to complete the polycyclic architecture. The late&#8208;stage syntheses of both triterpenoids feature a diimide reduction and a MHAT/1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer cascade to diastereoselectively forge the C20 and C17 stereogenic centers.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allenylic Substitution via Kinetic Resolution Enabled by New Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetic resolution of allenylic alcohols by asymmetric allenylic substitution has been achieved, which was enabled by the design of a new chiral ligand that altered the energetic profiles of the previously established pathways. Both secondary and tertiary alcohols were suitable substrates. Mechanism studies indicated that the reaction proceeds by an SN1 pathway.








Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic substitution represents a useful method for the construction of allenes bearing an allenylic central chirality, but current success has uniformly relied on only one specific chiral bidentate ligand. Herein, we address the limitation by the design of a new type of monodentate ligands leading to not only excellent enantiocontrol in allenylic substitution but also efficient kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;allenylic alcohols, a new phenomenon never observed before in iridium&#8208;catalyzed allenylic substitution. This is also a rare demonstration of the non&#8208;enzymatic kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;allenylic alcohols. A range of highly enantioenriched allenylic diarylmethanes and &#945;&#8208;allenylic alcohols could be accessed under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT studies indicated that this process proceeds by an SN1 pathway featuring a rate&#8208;determining ionization step followed by ligand&#8208;controlled enantiodetermining nucleophilic addition. The newly designed rigid and bulky ligands modified from SPHENOL were believed to assemble the key iridium&#8208;bound allenylic carbocation intermediate in a different complexation mode, thus serving as the origin of enantiocontrol and the unprecedented kinetic resolution.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Z&#8208;Selective Styrene Synthesis via Dual Cobalt and Photocatalysis Through Coupling of Unactivated Alkyl Iodides With Terminal Arylalkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;XAT/Co dual catalysis enables a highly Z&#8208;selective olefin synthesis through the reductive coupling of unactivated alkyl iodides with terminal arylalkynes. Syn&#8208;homoallylic alcohols can be synthesized in a facile one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequence. DFT calculations indicate that the reaction proceeds via a Co(II)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.








Abstract
An efficient Z&#8208;selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroalkylation of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides has been achieved, providing a straightforward and modular route to access 1,2&#8208;disubstituted Z&#8208;styrenes. This reaction operates under mild conditions without requiring over&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metal terminal reductants. Excellent Z/E ratios and good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. One potential utility of this reaction is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of several syn homoallylic alcohols in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step sequence. Control experiments strongly support that the halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process is the key to generating carbon radicals. DFT studies suggest that the catalytic system involves the Co(II)/Co(III) cycle and the steric repulsion between the Co(II) catalyst, and the alkenyl radical in radical capture by Co(II) is the dominant factor controlling the Z/E selectivity. This approach represents the first example of merging photo&#8208;XAT with cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Radical Alkylation by Synergistic Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Enzyme and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes and photoenzymatic catalysis represent two cutting&#8208;edge approaches to creating new enzyme reactivity. However, the potential of merging these two strategies remains underdeveloped for enantiocontrolled biotransformations. Herein, we develop a synergistic metalloenzymatic and photoredox catalysis platform to enable enantiodivergent radical alkylation of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Specifically, cupin proteins are redesigned to function as copper(II)&#8208;based Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;enzymes (LAses), which, in synergy with tripyridinyl&#8208;ruthenium&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, precisely control the generation, reactivity, and selectivity of abiological radicals, thereby unlocking non&#8208;natural enzyme reactivity. Powered by protein engineering, repurposed photo&#8208;LAses facilitate the green and efficient synthesis of diverse enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in high enantioselectivity (both enantiomers accessible, up to 97% yield and 98.5:1.5 enantiomeric ratio). Detailed mechanistic studies suggest a radical addition to the metalloenzymatic enolate pathway and explain the switched selectivity from dark to photoconditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Removing &#945;&#8208;H in Carboxylate&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Claisen&#8211;Esters&#8208;Condensation Reaction between &#945;&#8208;H and lithium metal as the degradation origin between carboxylate and lithium metal. Molecular engineering of &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;free ethyl trifluoroacetate (ETFA) and ethyl trimethylacetate (ETMA) enables complete suppression of chemical corrosion, construct anion&#8208;rich electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) enabling dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and practical battery performance.








Abstract
Although carboxylate esters greatly improve the cold weather performance of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilized in arctic expeditions, the underlying cause of the incompatibility between carboxylates and lithium (Li) anodes has not been sufficiently explained, resulting in the greatly restricted usage of carboxylate in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we reveal the serious parasitic reactions between carboxylate &#945;&#8208;H atoms and Li metal are the culprits that render carboxylate&#8208;based ineffectiveness for LMBs. By replacing all &#945;&#8208;H atoms with fluorine atoms and methyl groups, we successfully construct inert carboxylates and find the ions/molecules distribution in electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) can be manipulated at a molecular&#8208;level. The unique structure ensuring more anions are positioned closer to the Li surface in the EDL of the inert carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte, the morphology of the deposited Li is significantly regulated and the chemical corrosion gets effectively inhibited, as a consequence of remarkable extending lifespan of carboxylate&#8208;based LMBs with routine salt concentration and few additives. More generally, using carboxylates lacking &#945;&#8208;H atoms offer a realistic approach to increase the variety of solvents that can be used in LMBs electrolytes.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Rare Earth Halide Glasses for Tunable Multicolor X&#8208;ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halides have the advantages of high luminous efficiency and adjustable optical properties. However, there are no reports about organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halide glass. Herein, a hybrid rare earth halide glass Bzmim3LnCl6 (Bzmim&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole; Ln3+ = Tb3+, Eu3+) was prepared using a low&#8208;temperature melt quenching method to achieve multicolor luminescence under ultraviolet and X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
Rare earth&#8211;based all&#8208;inorganic glass&#8208;ceramics have played an important role in the field of optoelectronics. However, the research of organo&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halide glass that can be produced at low temperatures is still in the blank stage. In this paper, we report for the first time novel amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth&#8211;based halide luminescent glasses, Bzmim3LnCl6 (Bzmim&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium; Ln3+ = Tb3+, Eu3+), and realize tunable multicolor photoluminescence emission. By adjusting the ratio of Tb3+/Eu3+ within the Bzmim3LnCl6 glass, we have successfully induced controllable radioluminescence properties ranging from green to red under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Notably, these amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth glasses exhibit remarkable sensitivity to variations in X&#8208;ray dose, suggesting promising applications in the field of passive color visualization radiation detection. Furthermore, the Bzmim3TbCl6 glass demonstrates exceptional light transmittance greater than 85% across the 480&#8211;800&#160;nm range, which results in superior spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging (&gt;25 lp mm&#8722;1). These findings not only provide a good example for the design and development of hybrid rare earth&#8211;based halide glasses but also hold great potential for applications in detection, sensing, illumination, and display technologies.

         <title>Modulating the Chromophores of Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with different chromophores were designed and synthesized, which exhibit efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. Among which, MCOF&#8208;ANT with anthracene (ANT) group shows the highest HCOO&#8722; production rate of 1658&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert low&#8208;concentration CO2 into the value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is particularly interesting yet remains highly challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) through the Schiff&#8208;base condensation reactions between trinuclear copper complex and different BDP&#8208;based chromophores (BDP&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8722;. As a result, MCOF&#8208;ANT containing anthracene (ANT) groups achieves the highest HCOO&#8722; production rate of 1658&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (HCOO&#8722; selectivity, &#8764;100%) in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers under a laboratory light source, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively. Furthermore, MCOF&#8208;ANT also exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8722; under natural sunlight, with a HCOO&#8722; production rate of 1239&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (HCOO&#8722; selectivity, &#8764;100%). Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of ANT in MCOF&#8208;ANT is favorable to the visible&#8208;light harvesting and charge separation, as well as the formation of *OCO intermediate, which clearly accounts for its superior catalytic activity.

         <title>Electron Acceptors Based on Resonant N&#9472;B&#8592;N Unit with Improved Exciton Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of high&#8208;performance electron acceptors for short&#8208;wavelength infrared organic photodetectors (SWIR OPDs) has been demonstrated, following a strategy that is distinctly different from the general quinoidal and donor&#8211;acceptor strategies. The acceptor utilizes four thiophene&#8208;fused BODIPY units to achieve SWIR absorption, while pentafluorophenyl end groups enable efficient exciton dissociation.








Abstract
Device performance of photodiode&#8208;type short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) is largely limited by poor exciton dissociation. In this work, we reported that downshifted highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) and increased electrostatic potential (ESP) of electron acceptor lead to improved exciton dissociation and consequently enhanced SWIR OPD device performance. Tetramers of thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TF&#8208;BODIPY) unit represent a new kind of electron acceptors with SWIR photoresponse. By endcapping the TF&#8208;BODIPY tetramer with electron&#8208;deficient pentafluorophenyl groups, we downshift the EHOMO of the electron acceptor by 0.06&#160;eV and increase the ESP of the electron acceptor by 89&#160;meV. As a result, the OPD devices of the electron acceptor exhibit SWIR photoresponse in the wavelength range of 0.3&#8211;1.3&#160;&#181;m with a maximum specific detectivity (D*) of 1.04&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones and a responsivity (R) of 0.16 A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 1.12&#160;&#181;m. This performance is among the highest reported for SWIR OPDs.

     alt="Electron Acceptors Based on Resonant N&#9472;B&#8592;N Unit with Improved Exciton Dissociation for High-Performance Short-Wavelength Infrared Organic Photodetectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new class of high-performance electron acceptors for short-wavelength infrared organic photodetectors (SWIR OPDs) has been demonstrated, following a strategy that is distinctly different from the general quinoidal and donor&#8211;acceptor strategies. The acceptor utilizes four thiophene-fused BODIPY units to achieve SWIR absorption, while pentafluorophenyl end groups enable efficient exciton dissociation.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>New Transferrin Receptor&#8208;Targeting Conjugate Effectively Delivers DNA to Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel RNA aptamer targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR), conjugated with DSPE lipid, which achieves remarkably efficient brain uptake, reaching brain&#8208;to&#8208;serum ratios as high as 6.5. Through fluorescence imaging and polymerase&#8208;chain reaction analyses, we verify that this new conjugate successfully delivers a substantial amount of DNA oligonucleotide to the brains of Balb/cJ mice and demonstrates effectiveness in a human blood&#8211;brain barrier cell line model. 








Abstract
Delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) is one of the most challenging tasks for modern biopharmaceutics. Many attempts have been taken, with only low delivery efficacies achieved so far. We report a new transferrin receptor&#8208;targeting (TfR) RNA aptamer conjugated to DSPE lipid that leads to an unprecedented effective uptake in the brain, with brain&#8208;to&#8208;serum ratios up to 6.5 in mice. This result is superior to recently published values of &lt;&#160;1 for antibody conjugates and nanovesicles, pointing to a successful combined effect of the increased lipophilicity and TfR targeting with the new RNA aptamer that our conjugate provides. Using fluorescence whole body imaging, polymerase&#8208;chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we confirm that the new conjugate delivers high amounts of DNA oligonucleotide to brains of Balb/cJ mice, and it is effective in human cells. There is no acute toxicity as verified with histopathological assessment of mice organs. The combination of properties demonstrated by our new conjugate makes it a highly potent delivery tool that can be applied in therapy of brain diseases incl. glioblastoma, neurogenerative diseases, and a broad range of brain infections.

         <title>Concise Total Syntheses of Leuconoxine&#8208;Type Alkaloids Enabled by Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Pyrrole Difunctionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
Concise total syntheses of five leuconoxine alkaloids have been achieved using a pyrrole&#8208;centered strategy, which features a newly developed palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed pyrrole double C&#9472;H functionalization method, a divergent late&#8208;stage oxidative dearomatization tactic, and no use of protecting groups.








Abstract
Concise total syntheses of five leuconoxine&#8208;type alkaloids, i.e., chloromelodinine, leuconodine A, leuconodine F, melodinine E, and leuconoxine, are achieved through a pyrrole&#8208;centered strategy. The approach features a newly developed palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed pyrrole double C&#9472;H functionalization reaction to generate the core skeleton and a divergent oxidative dearomatization to complete the end game. In addition, no protecting group was employed, and the strategic use of a chloro substituent offers a number of advantages in these syntheses, which could have implications beyond this work. The discovery of an unusual chloro 1,2&#8208;migration reaction enabled the first total synthesis of chloromelodinine E. This work represents the shortest syntheses of these natural products to date with 10&#8211;11 total steps.

         <title>Antifreeze Protein Mimics Realizing Stable Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Water Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidized quasi&#8208;carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs), acting as mimics of antifreeze proteins, have been developed to regulate ice crystal formation and inhibit recrystallization. When incorporated into zinc&#8208;ion electrolytes, OQCNs effectively suppress ice growth in frozen electrolytes, thereby facilitating ion transpot. This regulation significantly enhances the low&#8208;temperature tolerance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries under high&#8208;moisture conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous metal batteries offer inherent safety and low cost due to the predominance of water in their aqueous electrolytes, yet their practical applications are severely limited by electrolyte freezing under subzero conditions. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that protect living organisms from freezing damage, we synthesize oxidized quasi&#8208;carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs) featuring a regularly in&#8208;plane structure commensurate with the prism face of hexagonal ice crystal. At an ultralow concentration, the as&#8208;synthetic OQCNs effectively mimic AFP functionalities by controlling ice crystal morphology, suppressing ice growth kinetics, and inhibiting ice recrystallization. This synergistic mechanism preserves continuous ion transport pathways while mitigating physical damage to battery components caused by ice crystal growth. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gibbs&#8211;Thomson effect underpins the suppression of ice growth, avoiding complete solidification of the electrolyte under subzero conditions. The OQCNs&#8208;modified electrolyte exhibits exceptional cryogenic performance at &#8722;30 &#176;C, with Zn||Zn symmetric cell maintaining stable cycling of 1000 h and Zn||NH4+&#8208;intercalated vanadium oxide (NVO) battery preserving 91.48% capacity retention through 5000 cycles (over 90 days). This work unveils a bioinspired paradigm that significantly enhances the performance of eco&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;moisture electrolytes, paving the way for robust, low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant zinc&#8208;ion batteries and related aqueous electrolyte&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Aminomethyl Phosphonic Acid as Highly Effective Multifunctional Additive for Modification of Electron Transport Layer and Perovskite in Photovoltaic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), was proposed as multifunctional additive to modify the SnO2 electron transport layer and perovskite layer as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. The crystallinity, and electrical and optical properties of both SnO2 and perovskite layers were improved significantly. Consequently, the PCE of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs was enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22% with superb stability.








Abstract
The passivation of detrimental perovskite&#8208;based defects is critically acknowledged for fabricating highly effective perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The presence of a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL) is also considered a pivotal factor for effective charge extraction and transport dynamics. Herein, a simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the SnO2 ETL. The defects in the SnO2 ETL are effectively suppressed by passivating the oxygen vacancies upon the SnO2 surface. Simultaneously, the carrier mobility and crystallinity of SnO2 are enhanced, and the upward&#8208;regulated conduction band minimum (CBM) is beneficial for constructing a favorable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. Notably, the introduced residuals on the SnO2 surface can function as crystalline seeds for growth of large perovskite grains, which can passivate the defects in the perovskite bulk phase, boundaries, as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs is enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22%. Most importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with AMPA maintained 94.9% of the initial PCE during 720&#160;h of storage at a relative humidity of 10%, attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of both the SnO2 and perovskite layers after AMPA modification.

         <title>Isolable Three&#8208;Coordinate Base&#8208;Stabilized Alumylene: A Precursor of Persistent Acceptor&#8208;Free Monomeric Aluminum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric alumylene stabilized by two donor ligands (phosphine and NHC) has been successfully synthesized. This alumylene complex exhibits an enhanced nucleophilic character and a preserved ambiphilic reactivity compared to the monoligated complex. As a consequence, its oxidation by N2O proceeds even at &#8722;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of an acceptor&#8208;free aluminum oxide persistent up to &#8722;70 &#176;C.








Abstract
An isolable monomeric alumylene 2 stabilized by two donating ligands (phosphine and NHC) has been synthesized. Experimental and theoretical analysis confirm that the NHC ligand in 2 is labile and reversibly dissociates from the AlI center above &#8722;20 &#176;C. Of particular interest, despite being thermodynamically stabilized by two donor ligands, alumylene complex 2 exhibits a high reactivity with a considerably higher nucleophilicity compared to the monophosphine&#8208;ligated complex 5. It is interesting to note that 2 reacts immediately with N2O at &#8722;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of bis&#8208;ligated aluminum oxide 15, which is stable up to &#8722;70 &#176;C.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Equilibrium in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Transition Metal Complexes: Selective Isolation of Multinuclear Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes containing bis(NHC) ligand were found to exist in a temperature&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent slow equilibrium between tri&#8208; and tetranuclear forms in solution. This was leveraged for the exclusive isolation of the tetranuclear species by dissolving the equilibrium through strong and stable H&#8208;bonding interactions. In contrast, the use of ClO4 as a guest, led to the exclusive formation of the guest encapsulated trinuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complex.








Abstract
The AgI&#8211;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes (3a,b) derived from bis(NHC) ligand 1, which exhibit a temperature&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium between the trinuclear and tetranuclear forms, has been successfully isolated, which is slow on NMR time scale. Intriguingly, by freezing this slow equilibrium, facilitated by strong and stable H&#8208;bonding, we could achieve selective isolation of the tetranuclear species (3a,b&#8208;II). On the other hand, encapsulation of an anionic guest, ClO4, led to exclusive formation of the guest encapsulated trinuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complex, 3a&#8208;I. This is unprecedented and marks the first instance where selective isolation of both the species involved in an equilibrium using a C&#8208;donor ligand could be attained. In contrast, distinct behavior was observed with the AuI ion, possessing the same linear geometry, however, with stronger M&#8211;CNHC bonds. In this context, a stable non&#8208;exchangeable&#160;&#8776;1:1 mixture (4a,b) of the tri&#8208; and tetranuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complexes were obtained via transmetalation of both equilibrating (3a,b) and the H&#8208;bonded tetranuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complexes (3a,b&#8208;II). Moreover, by aptly adjusting the reaction parameters of transmetalation process, the trinuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complex (4a,b&#8208;I) could indeed be obtained selectively. Overall, this study highlights a pioneering approach for the control of an equilibrium between different nuclearity metallo&#8208;supramolecular species engaging C&#8208;donor ligands.

         <title>Fast and Autonomous Mannosylated Nanomotors for Dynamic Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;loaded nanomotor decorated with mannose polymers shows a synergistic effect with respect to cell targeting. The mannose units interact with mannose receptors (MRs) on the cell surface, whereas the presence of the glycopolymer on the motor surface also leads to a more effective motile behavior in cell medium.








Abstract
An attractive strategy in cancer cell therapy is to employ motile nanoparticles that can actively search for their target. Herein, we introduce mannosylated compartmentalized cross&#8208;linked enzyme&#8208;driven nanomotors (c&#8208;CLEnM), which exhibit specific and efficient targeting of Hep G2 cells through elevated autonomous motion. In this design, we constructed biodegradable bowl&#8208;shaped stomatocytes encapsulating the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT) within their nanocavity. A subsequent enzyme crosslinking reaction was performed to guarantee their stability. Furthermore, the c&#8208;CLEnM were surface modified with a mannose&#8208;functional glycopolymer, enabling binding with receptors expressed on Hep G2 cells. Interestingly, the targeting ligands on the nanomotors not only improved their specificity toward cancer cells but also enhanced motility. Compared to the non&#8208;mannosylated nanomotors, mannosylated c&#8208;CLEnM exhibited enhanced motion and higher targeting efficiency to cells in glucose&#8208;containing ionic environments. The unexpected acceleration in speed resulted from the surface modification of these nanomotors with a glycopolymer layer, which increased the zeta potential and created a shielding effect that mitigated the influence of the surrounding ions. This nanomotor design highlights the synergistic effect of functional glycopolymer modification on cellular uptake, adding an additional level of control to nanomotors for application in cancer therapy.

         <title>Short Lifetime Radical Metal Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first luminescence radical cluster was constructed with open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligands. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission endows it with 100% exciton utilization and a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale, making it suitable for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging without residual images.








Abstract
Metal clusters, an emerging class of scintillator materials, have attracted much attention owing to their inherently high X&#8208;ray absorption, mild synthesis conditions, low toxicity, strong luminescence, and large Stokes shift. However, the decay lifetime of metal clusters is usually on the order of microseconds, which is unfavorable for safety inspection, nondestructive testing, and medical imaging. Here, the open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligand was used to construct the first radical cluster scintillator Cu2I2(L)4. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission of Cu2I2(L)4 theoretically enabled 100% exciton utilization and exhibited a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale. Cu2I2(L)4 can be fabricated into a flexible scintillator screen for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a high resolution of 30.7&#160;LP mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the Cu2I2(L)4 scintillator screen has no residual images during X&#8208;ray imaging. This work reports the first luminescent metal cluster with a radical ligand and presents a new strategy for constructing short lifetime X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>Phthalocyanine Grafting Strategy Induces Strong Intrinsic Electric Fields and Molecule&#8208;Edge Carrier Transport Pathways for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited charge separation, slow charge mobility, and high electron&#8208;hole recombination rates remain critical challenges impeding the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. More regrettably, the charge transfer pathways within bulk charge transport are not yet fully understood, and the development of effective strategies to design these pathways remains a significant challenge. Herein, by optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands, we developed a molecularly functionalized layer, 4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;carbazole copper phthalocyanine (4EtCz&#8208;Pc), which is characterized by a strong dipole moment, a large internal electric field, and surprisingly positive electrostatic potential at the edge. When integrated in conjunction with the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) and the semiconductor photoanode BiVO4 (BVO), it forms a Co(OH)2/4EtCz&#8208;Pc/BiVO4 composite photoanode system. This innovative photoanode demonstrates an exceptional performance with continuous output for a duration of 15 hours. Additionally, a variety of advanced characterization methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) analyses, confirmed that 4EtCz&#8208;Pc significantly reduces the energy barrier for hole injection from the anode to the active layer during PEC catalysis. This study proposes an effective strategy to optimize the ligands grafted onto phthalocyanine, generating a strong internal electric field that facilitates the formation of new charge transport pathways within the photoanode.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Molecular Configuration to Drive Facet&#8208;Selective Zn Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct use of metal anode emerges as a key strategy in advancing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, applicable across non&#8208;protonic, aqueous, and solid&#8208;state battery systems. To enhance battery durability, one effective approach involves employing interfacial molecular modification to modulate metal's facet orientation, reducing the tendency of metals to form random and loose morphologies during deposition. Herein, we propose a model to elucidate how dicarboxylic acid molecules with varying alkyl chain lengths modulate their adsorption behavior and deposition rate on Zn surfaces, achieving facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition. Taking glutaric acid (GA) as an example, its medium alkyl chain length allows for a "flat&#8208;lying" adsorption configuration on Zn(002) surface, resulting in strong adsorption and Zn&#8208;GA metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface. This regulates Zn2+ diffusion process and restricts its accessibility to the Zn(002) facet, facilitating the selective exposure of Zn(002) facet. Due to this design, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell stably operates at a high current density of 20 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and a high depth of discharge of 85%. The Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity of 1.1 Ah with 90% capacity retention. This metal&#8208;molecule interface design can be extended to other metal anodes, with the potential for tailored molecular selections to regulate the selective growth of crystal facets.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Dendrite Growth by Dolosse&#8208;structured ZIF&#8208;67 Polycrystalline Membranes through Eliminating Interfacial Electrolyte Turbulence on Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, but the Zn dendrite problem limits their practical application potential. Although existing solutions, such as electrolyte additives and electrode coatings, can effectively address this issue, but almost all these solutions are based on a static electrolyte model and overlook the relationship between electrolyte flow and dendrite growth. Herein, inspired by the principle of dolosse to reduce the impact of waves on coastlines, we utilized the epitaxial growth characteristics of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct a ZIF&#8208;67 polycrystalline membrane with macro&#8208;microporous on Zn foil (D&#8208;67M@Zn). The dolosse&#8208;like structure of the membrane effectively eliminates turbulence at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, enabling Zn2+ to deposit in a stable electrolyte environment, reducing the secondary nucleation rate of Zn, and inhibiting dendrite growth. The macro&#8208;microporous skeleton also helps regulate the morphology of Zn deposition, as confirmed by fluid dynamics analysis and AC&#8208;STEM. Benefiting from the unique properties of D&#8208;67M, both symmetric cells and full cells based on the D&#8208;67M@Zn anode exhibit impressive cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;Quinoline Transmutation Enabled by a Formal&#160;Rhodium Carbynoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeleton editing is an emerging and powerful tool in organic chemistry because it can simplify synthetic procedures towards complex molecules. Herein, we present an approach for indole&#8208;quinoline transmutation through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C2(sp2)&#8211;C3(sp2) bond of an indole with an&#160;&#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt&#160;that we developed. This protocol involves a formal trifluoromethyl rhodium carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh) resembling a trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:), allowing facile access to an array of quinolines in moderate to high yields. Potential applications in the late&#8208;stage skeletal editing of pharmaceutical and natural product derivatives, preparation of adapalene analogs, scaled&#8208;up synthesis, and transformations of products are highlighted. Finally, a computational study was conducted to support the envisioned mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diamond as a material has many unique properties. More recently, diamond has emerged as a material with a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology. The high intrinsic stability of diamond, coupled with the ability to modify diamond surfaces with a wide range of species via highly stable covalent linkages, provides a wealth of opportunity to couple diamond&#8217;s chemical properties with its extraordinary physical properties . The practical utility of diamond has been greatly expanded recently through dramatic advances in the ability to produce diamond in bulk, thin film, and nanoparticle form, with controlled doping and purity at modest cost. These advances, together with diamond&#8217;s highly stable and tuneable surface chemistry with versatility of physical structure&#160;enable a wide range of emerging applications of interest to chemists, including quantum science, biomedicine, and catalysis. Yet, to fully exploit the unique properties of diamond, some formidable chemical challenges lie ahead.
We begin by reviewing main features of diamond that are of particular importance to the chemistry community. We highlight some of the important applications where diamond chemistry plays a key role, identify some key observations, and outline some of the future directions and opportunities for diamond in the chemical world.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn2+&#8208;Activated Alkali Lithooxidosilicate Phosphors as Sustainable Alternative White&#8208;Light Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eu2+ activated alkali lithooxidosilicates have emerged as promising candidates for narrow&#8208;band cyan and green&#8208;emitting phosphors for human&#8208;centered lighting. Despite the vivid research on Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates, little to nothing is known about the possible luminescence with other activator ions than Eu2+. The more abundant transition metal ion Mn2+ is a potential alternative emitter with tunable emission over the visible spectral range. Mn2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates show two emission bands in the green and red spectral range respectively, making them intriguing candidates for one&#8208;component phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes. A total of seven Mn2+ activated compounds was prepared to elucidate possible trends. The results show that the ratio between green and red emission correlates to the size of the available activator sites and is easily controlled by the composition of the alkali lithooxidosilicate host compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence studies reveal that thermal quenching occurs slightly above room temperature for those compounds, which may be connected to the comparably low band gaps for silicates (Eg &lt; 6 eV) and a consequent thermal ionization of excited electrons into the conduction band. Overall, this study comprises the first class of compounds with efficient tailored white&#8208;light emission based on Mn2+ within one host compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dactyloquinone A and Spiroetherone A via a Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT) Process and a Quinol&#8211;Enedione Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the total synthesis of dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A from a meroterpenoid scaffold obtained by the deconjugative alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher type ketone. For dactyloquinone A, we employed an intramolecular hydrofunctionalisation of the internal trisubstituted alkene with a quinone monoacetal via a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process to form the key C&#8211;O bond. For spiroetherone A, we relied on a stereospecific quinol&#8208;spiroenedione rearrangement. The initially postulated structure of spiroetherone A was first synthesized, but was found to be different from the natural product. Finally, spiroetherone A was shown to be epimeric at the spirocyclic carbon. This finding was confirmed by total synthesis involving epimerization of the spirocycle via a late&#8208;stage singlet oxygen [4+2] cycloaddition to a cyclohexadiene derived from the initial enedione.</dc:description>

The initially postulated structure of spiroetherone A was first synthesized, but was found to be different from the natural product. Finally, spiroetherone A was shown to be epimeric at the spirocyclic carbon. This finding was confirmed by total synthesis involving epimerization of the spirocycle via a late-stage singlet oxygen [4+2] cycloaddition to a cyclohexadiene derived from the initial enedione.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Pnictaalumenes towards 1,3&#8208;Dipole Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cyclisation reactions with organic azides giving 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Pnictaalumenes RPn=AlR&#712; are the isoelectronic congeners of alkynes, hence a similar reactivity towards 1,3&#8208;dipole molecules is expected. Herein, we report the reactions of DippTerPn=AlCp* (DippTer&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8209;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)&#8208;C6H3, Cp*&#160;=&#160;[Me5C5]&#8722;, Pn&#160;=&#160;P, As) towards aryl azides. Instead of the anticipated phosphaaluminatriazole products from a [3+2] cyclisation, the formation of four&#8208;membered AlN2Pn ring systems of the general form DippTerPn(&#956;&#8208;NR)2AlCp* was observed. Depending on the steric profile of the azide, different outcomes are observed: (a) N&#945; insertion into the Pn=Al bond accompanied by twofold N2 elimination, (b) N&#947; insertion under preservation of the N3 motif or (c) mixed Na/N&#947; products. The bonding situation is complex and best described as Al(III) complexes with NPnN&#8208;amino&#8208;amide&#8208;type ligands. A twofold insertion also occurs with the isovalent electronic diazoalkane Me3Si(H)C=N2, yielding imine&#8208;substituted AlN2Pn derivatives. In the case of its P&#8209;congener, two thermal rearrangements are observed, which first result in a AlN3P ring species with a terminal Al&#8722;CN unit, followed by a second slower rearrangement to an aluminate cyanido complex with an unusual NNN pincer&#8208;type ligand framework. The current study contrasts well&#8208;established [3+2] cyclisation reactions between alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dipoles and provides access to unprecedented ligand motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Supported Single Fe/Co/Ni Atom Catalysts for Water Oxidation: Unveiling the Dynamic Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extensive research has been conducted on carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical applications, owing to their outstanding conductivity and high metal atom utilization. The atomic dispersion of active sites provides an ideal platform to investigate the structure&#8208;performance correlations. Despite this, the development of straightforward and scalable synthesis methods, along with the tracking of the dynamic active sites under catalytic conditions, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we introduce a biomass&#8208;inspired coordination confinement strategy to construct a series of carbon&#8208;supported SACs, incorporating various metal elements, such as Fe, Co, Ni. We have systematically characterized their electronic and geometric structure using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and atomic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses, it is demonstrated that the single atoms undergo structural rearrangement to form amorphous (oxy)hydroxide clusters during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the newly formed oxygen&#8208;bridged dual metal M&#8208;O&#8208;M or M&#8208;O&#8208;M&#8217; (M/M&#8217;=Fe, Co, Ni) moieties within these clusters play key role in the OER performance. This work provides essential insights into tracking the actual active sites of SACs during electrochemical OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Olefin with Nitroarenes via Intermolecular Nitroso Ene Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic allylamines are essential in the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical building blocks. While oxidative allylic C&#8211;H amination using anilines has advanced significantly, achieving intermolecular reductive allylic C&#8211;H amination of olefins with readily available nitroarenes remains a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate that replacing silanes with a combination of protons and electrons enables selective reductive allylic C&#8211;H amination, avoiding the competing hydroamination pathway. The key to this transformation is the use of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) as the solvent. This process complements previous oxidative allylic C&#8211;H amination by eliminating the need for noble metal catalysts while tolerating oxidizable or nucleophilic functional groups. Notably, this method facilitates the functionalization of bioactive compounds, underscoring its potential in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, by leveraging its reactivity with trisubstituted olefins, this approach, when combined with metal hydride atom transfer (MHAT) reactions, offers a unique strategy for regioselective and modular difunctionalization of aliphatic olefins. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies highlight the crucial roles of TFE in stabilizing the nitrosoarene intermediate and promoting the key nitroso&#8208;ene step.</dc:description>

         <title>High Partial Molar Volume Polymer Electrolyte for Upgraded Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries combined with solid electrolytes represent a highly promising technology for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, their cycling performance encounters inferior stability due to the continuous growth of Li&#8208;dendrites. The initial motivation for Li&#8208;dendrite growth theoretically arises from the high chemical potential difference (&#8710;&#956;) at the electrolyte/Li metal interface, yet the effectiveness of &#8710;&#956; regulation lacks experimental validation. Here, we experimentally present the impact of &#8710;&#956; on the growth of Li&#8208;dendrites through manipulation of the partial molar volume of Li+ (V_(Li^+ )) in the polymer electrolyte. By weakening Li&#8208;O coordination structure, the as&#8208;produced high&#8208;V_(Li^+ ) polymer electrolyte (108.5 cm3/mol) shows 83% decrease in &#8710;&#956; (289 J/mol) compared with conventional counterparts, thereby enabling stable cycling for &gt;10 months in a Li||Li cell and &gt;2000 cycles in a Li||Cu cell with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 96%. To one's delight, a practical cylindrical Li||Li[Ni0.5Co0.3Mn0.2]O2 cell with capacity of 0.62 Ah delivers excellent cycle stability with negligible capacity attenuation over 95 cycles at 0.2 C. The beneficial role of high V_(Li^+ ) is leveraged to introduce a new dimension in polymer electrolyte engineering, highlighting the underexplored design strategy of regulating interfacial &#8710;&#956; to rejuvenate practical lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although photothermal catalysis is a clean, efficient, and green approach to access organic products, its application in the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), however, is still unprecedented. Herein, we report the photothermal catalytic synthesis of C&#8208;C bond linked COF under visible light, which can be a reusable photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. Furthermore, we have developed a new postsynthetic modification strategy to construct COFs by photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven hydroamination via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. The obtained COF containing sulfonic acid group showed an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes under mild reaction conditions. These results not only enrich the COF synthetic methodology but also open a new route to access COFs in a green and sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung Difluoroalkylation of Imines Enables General Access to &#946;&#8208;Difluoroalkylated Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of &#946;-difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel-catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2-azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. This approach is characterized by its high efficiency, broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and ease of synthesis. The rapid modification of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in bioactive molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach shows the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ATP&#8208;Assisted Electron and Proton Transfer Boosting Redox Metabolism&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis and Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the intractability of traditional apoptosis, the vulnerability exposed by cancer cell metabolic reprogramming provides an advantage for ferroptosis treatment. Herein, we developed vanadate and aurintricarboxylic acid coordination nanoparticles (VAP NPs) that synergistically trigger dual cell death pathways. This nanoplatform leveraged dual&#8208;Russell mechanisms and Fenton reactions to generate singlet oxygen/hydroxyl radicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) while depleting glutathione via vanadium redox cycling, thereby silencing glutathione peroxidase 4 and modulating the Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/Nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (NRF2)/Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) axis. Notably, TME&#8208;overexpressed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acted as a biochemical catalyst, accelerating the transfer of protons and electrons during reactive oxygen species generation to amplify therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, VAP NPs could achieve outstanding efficacy for intrinsically stimulated synergy of ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor therapy. This study provides reference for revealing the new function of ATP in enhancing the regulation of redox metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiospecific Halogenation Modulates Molecular Dipoles in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogenated carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) are promising hole&#8208;extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSC). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function of ITO and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of regio&#8208;chemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;sigma migratory ring expansion (SMRE) of common dieneylcyclopropanes (DECPs) and dieneylcyclobutanes (DECPs) fails. But replacing the terminal CH2 group with CF2 group for both DECPs and DECBs, the resulting substrates of gem&#8208;difluorodienylcyclopropanes (df&#8208;DECPs) and gem&#8208;difluorodienylcyclobutanes (df&#8208;DECBs) can achieve this reaction, which has broad reaction scope and high efficiency to give seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered carbocycles with a carbonyl group. The keys to the success of this reaction are: oxidative cyclization becomes easier with the help of two F atoms; the metallacycle intermediate can detour the sluggish reductive elimination by defluorination to generate Rh carbene intermediate (defluorocarbenation process), which can undergo easier carbene migratory insertion and &#946;&#8208;H elimination, giving rise to the final products. Mechanistic studies via experiments and quantum chemistry calculations support the proposed mechanism. The gem&#8208;difluoro ene in the substrates of df&#8208;DECPs and df&#8208;DECBs of the present SMRE reaction can be regarded as a ketene surrogate, and this strategy can be exploited in many transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Tailored Shape&#8208;matched Interactions towards Ambient&#8208;temperature Argon Removal for Oxygen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;purity oxygen (O2)&#160;is essential for high&#8208;value&#8208;added applications in the medical, aerospace, and electronics sectors. The production of high&#8208;purity O2 via non&#8208;thermal&#8208;driven pressure&#8208;swing adsorption has the advantages of portable operation and low energy consumption. However, effectively removing trace amounts of argon (Ar) impurities in this process is indispensable and it is a fundamental challenge to achieve the preferential adsorption of inert Ar atoms over polar O2 molecules instead of traditional thermodynamic or molecule sieving strategies. Herein, we have demonstrated this problem was addressed by integrating spheroidal shape&#8208;matched interactions to fit the spheroid Ar atoms, while repulsing the linear O2 molecules. Using this strategy, customized TYUT&#8208;20 enables the exceptional recognition of Ar atoms over O2 molecules, demonstrating an unprecedented Ar adsorption capacity of up to 14.5 cm3/g and a top&#8208;performing Ar/O2 (1.54) selectivity at 298 K and 1 bar. The Ar atom recognition mechanism on this adsorbent has been investigated using Ar&#8208;loaded single crystal diffraction analysis and molecular simulation studies. The productivity of high&#8208;purity O2 (&gt;99.99%) from a 5/95 Ar/O2 mixture breakthrough experiment reached 6.6 L/kg under ambient conditions, which highlighted TYUT&#8208;20 as a very promising adsorbent in ready&#8208;to&#8208;use high&#8208;purity O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#8220;Flexible&#8221; Solvent Molecule Enabling High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the BTF diluent and the 2,5&#8208;THF solvent result in an expansion of the bond angle in the 2,5&#8208;THF molecules. This structural alteration increases the steric hindrance of 2,5&#8208;THF, while simultaneously reducing its polarity. Consequently, the anion ratio within the solvation structure of the electrolyte is elevated, which enhances the electrochemical performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode.







Abstract
Electrolyte chemistries are crucial for achieving high cycling performance and high energy density in lithium metal batteries. The localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) exhibit good performance in lithium metal batteries. However, understanding how the intermolecular interactions between solvents and diluents in the electrolyte regulate the solvation structure and interfacial layer structure remains limited. Here, we reported a new LHCE in which strong hydrogen bonding between diluents and solvents alters the conformation and polarity of &#8220;flexible&#8221; solvent molecules, thereby effectively regulating the solvation structure of Li+ ion and promoting the formation of robust electrode interfaces. The endpoint H of the &#8220;flexible&#8221; chain O&#8208;CH&#8208;CH3 of the 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5&#8208;THF) solvent and the F of the benzotrifluoride (BTF) diluent can form strong hydrogen bonds, which expand the maximum bond angle of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule from 119&#176; to 123&#176;. The expanded bond angle increases the steric hindrance of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule and decreases its polarity. This leads to an increase in the anion content within the solvation structure, which in turn enhances the performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. As a result, the lithium metal anode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of as high as 99.4&#8201;%. The assembled Li||SPAN battery based on our developed LHCE exhibits impressive stability with an average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 700 cycles. Moreover, the Li||SPAN pouch cell can be stably cycled with a high energy density of 301.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This molecular&#8208;level understanding of the correlation between molecular interactions and solvation structures provides new insights into the design of advanced LHCEs for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the BTF diluent and the 2,5-THF solvent result in an expansion of the bond angle in the 2,5-THF molecules. This structural alteration increases the steric hindrance of 2,5-THF, while simultaneously reducing its polarity. Consequently, the anion ratio within the solvation structure of the electrolyte is elevated, which enhances the electrochemical performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode.

Logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobots are engineered for cascade responses to extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular microenvironmental factors (K+ and H+), enabling targeted cargo delivery, lysosomal interference, and enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;recognizing DNA nanodevices have proven promising for cellular manipulation and disease treatment, whereas how to sequentially respond to different cellular microenvironments remains a challenge. To this end, here we elaborate a logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobot (Gi&#8208;DR) for the cascade response to inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;cellular microenvironments, thereby achieving lysosome&#8208;targeted cargo delivery for subcellular interference and tumor treatment with enhanced efficacy. Utilizing G&#8208;quadruplexes to respond to high&#8208;level K+ in cancer cell surrounding, this Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot can activate an aptamer&#8208;based transmembrane DNA machine that delivers molecular payloads to cellular lysosome. Accordingly, the nanoassembly of Gi&#8208;DR is promoted by the folding of heterodimeric i&#8208;motifs in the acidic microenvironment. Such a design allows the extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular behaviors of the Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot to be programmed by an YES&#8208;AND logic circuit, with environmental K+ and H+ as two inputs. As a consequence, DNA nanostrips are controllably formed in living cells, interfering with lysosomal function and thereby preventing cellular proliferation. Further, a therapeutic agent (i.e. ligand&#8208;drug conjugate) is delivered into target cancer cells for synergistic tumor treatment in vivo, exhibiting the super&#8208;enhanced cancer cell lethality and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It well illustrates that our designed logic&#8208;gated DNA nanorobot has broad application prospects in modulating cellular function and precision disease treatment.

         <title>Manipulating Dynamic Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition and Static Reversible Photochromism by an Organic Cocrystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a supramolecular assembly strategy for charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal system allows realization of a dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition as well as reversible photochromic behavior, in particular a time&#8208;dependent green&#8208;fading&#8208;yellow fluorescence variation during UV irradiation. These properties allow potential application in photoactivated anti&#8208;counterfeiting functional materials.







Abstract
Developing of molecular crystalline materials with light&#8208;induced multiple dynamic deformation in space dimension and photochromism on time scales has attracted much attention for its potential applications in actuators, sensoring and information storage. Nevertheless, organic crystals capable of both photoinduced dynamic effects and static color change are rare, particularly for multi&#8208;component cocrystal system. In this study, we first report the construction of charge transfer cocrystal allows their light&#8208;induced solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition and photochromic behaviors to be controlled by trans&#8208;stilbene (TSB) as an electron donor and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalonitrile (TFP) as an electron acceptor. In this case, the dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition is due to the photoisomerization of TSB under UV light irradiation, while the accumulation of melted droplets during solid&#8208;state photochemical process causes mechanical deformation of TSB&#8208;TFP cocrystals. The subsequent reversible photochromic behavior is attributed to the emergence of free radicals through a photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. Moreover, TSB&#8208;TFP microcrystals present typical excitation wavelength dependent emission (EWDE) fluorescence by surfactant&#8208;mediated method. This work realizes the dynamic&#8208;static photochemical cascade processes in response to UV light irradiation in an organic cocrystal system, providing the effective method for a new type of smart photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>A Strategy of Enhancing Polarization to Achieve Excellent Energy Storage Performance in Simple Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Based Relaxors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the polarization of relaxors necessitates large local polarization and high breakdown field strength. Dielectrics with low hysteresis are obtained via the chemical regulation for Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 with substantial local polarity. Large polarization is released at a high electric field, thereby achieving exceptional dielectric energy&#8208;storage performance. The mechanism of its high performance is also elucidated through the local structure analysis at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Dielectric energy storage capacitors are indispensable components in advanced electronic and electrical systems. Excellent performance requires the dielectric materials possessing low residual polarization (Pr), high breakdown strength (Eb), and large maximum polarization (Pm). The first two parameters can be typically achieved through chemical regulation, while the Pmax is closely related to the matrix. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that a strong coupling of A&#8208;O bonds and a large lattice can enhance polarization, thus identifying the prototype Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 as a favorable matrix. Here, ultrahigh energy density of 16.5&#8197;J/cm3 and high efficiency of 88.2&#8201;% are achieved in 0.76Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;0.24Ca0.5Sr0.5HfO3 binary system. This system exhibits the highest comprehensive performance among all reported Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based ceramics. The large perovskite framework facilitated by the large ionic radius of K+ enhances the local polarity of Bi&#8722;O and Ca&#8722;O, resulting in a large Pm of 57.4&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 under an ultrahigh Eb of 82&#8197;kV/mm. The highly disordered local polar clusters at the nanoscale lead to negligible Pr and high &#951;. This work not only provides a unique design concept to enhance the comprehensive energy storage performance from the perspective of local structure, but also offers insight into the origin of high performance.

         <title>Interfacial Asymmetrically Coordinated Zn&#8722;MOF for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrosynthetic Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface coordination strategy has been developed by constructing Zn&#8722;O bridges between ZIF&#8208;7 and graphite felt matrix, which promotes NO electrocatalytic conversion into highly value&#8208;added piperidone oxime due to the faster electron transportation and distorted coordinated mode of Zn sites. It provides an impressive method for designing effective electrocatalysts towards electrosynthetic organic chemicals.







Abstract
Oximes are important intermediates for various chemicals synthesis such as pharmaceuticals, among which one vital precursor for producing neurological disease, antimicrobial and anticancer agents is piperidone oxime (PDO). Compared with conventional thermocatalytic method, it's more attractive to synthesize PDO via green electrocatalytic technology especially utilizing waste nitrogen oxides gas as nitrogen source. However, there are great challenges in catalyst design for high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthetic oxime due to the low electron transport rate and multiple competing reactions. Herein, we propose an interfacial coordination strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) electrocatalyst for the first time to promote oxime electrosynthesis, by building Zn&#8722;O bridges between graphite felt (GF) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;7/CGF). Specially, ZIF&#8208;7/CGF delivers a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 75.9&#8201;% with yield up to 73.1&#8201;% for 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidone oxime, which is far superior to the catalyst without Zn&#8722;O bridges (a FE of 10.7&#8201;% and yield of 10.3&#8201;%). In&#8208;depth mechanism study shows that the introducing Zn&#8722;O bridges can promote the electron transfer and induce Zn sites transforming into distorted tetrahedron (Zn&#8208;N3O) coordination mode, which benefits for intermediates adsorption and conversion. The developed strategy presents wide universalities towards various oximes electrosynthesis and adapts to other MOF materials (ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;4). This work provides new insights for electrosynthetic organic chemicals and upgrading nitrogen cycle through rational design surficial coordinated electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Allyl Ketones via BINAP&#8208;CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy allyl ketones: A highly enantioselective CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of benzhydryloxyallene for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones is reported. This highly facile and sustainable method also provides access to syn&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones with&#945;&#8208;substituted carboxylic anhydrides through &#8216;matched&#8208;mismatched&#8217; reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrocupration of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds to generate organometallic nucleophiles has recently become an attractive alternative to conventional stoichiometric reagents in the stereoselective synthesis. Herein, we have developed an efficient and economical method to synthesize enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones via a copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of alkoxyallenes, a significant advancement given the scarcity of reports on such scaffolds in the literature. DFT calculations reveal that this reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic attack of a kinetically favourable Z&#8208;selective allyl&#8208;copper intermediate on acid anhydrides via a six&#8208;membered chair&#8208;like transition state, stabilized by strongly attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions that ultimately leads to high level of enantioselectivities using the simple BINAP ligand. This method successfully overcomes the challenges of over&#8208;reduction of carbonyl functionality in the presence of CuH&#8208;complex, olefin isomerization and the presence of a highly enolizable &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, which can lead to erosion in enantioselectivities, making our strategy highly desirable. The reaction exhibits a wide range of substrate scope including symmetrical as well as carbonic anhydrides with both aromatic, and aliphatic substitutions. In addition, &#945;&#8208;substituted acid anhydrides provide exclusive syn&#8208;selective &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones in excellent enantiomeric ratios, where the nucleophilic allylation occurs on one of the carbonyls containing the matched &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, confirmed with mechanistic studies.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol Aqueous Phase Reforming for Sustainable Polyethylene Hydrogenolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process was developed to convert polyethylene (PE) into n&#8208;alkanes by coupling PE hydrogenolysis with methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR). Utilizing a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, the process achieved 85.1&#8201;% PE conversion and 81.0&#8201;% selectivity toward liquid fuels and lubricant oils, reducing reliance on fossil fuels through eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Depolymerizing plastic waste through hydrogen&#8208;based processes, such as hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, presents a promising solution for converting plastics into liquid fuels. However, conventional hydrogen production methods rely heavily on fossil fuels, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste hydrogenolysis that utilizes in situ hydrogen generated via the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol, a biomass&#8208;derived chemical offering a more sustainable alternative. Our results show that a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst achieved high conversion (85.1&#8201;%) and selectivity (81.0&#8201;%) towards liquid fuels and lubricant oils in a tandem process combining polyethylene (PE) hydrogenolysis and methanol APR. By tuning the metal loading, we identified that Pt enhances hydrogen production through methanol APR, while Ru drives C&#8722;C bond cleavage, which is crucial for PE hydrogenolysis. Isotope labeling analysis confirmed that hydrogen generated from methanol APR is effectively utilized in the PE hydrogenolysis reaction. This method was also successfully applied to post&#8208;consumer polyolefin waste, with selectivity toward valuable products ranging from 75.0&#8201;% to 88.9&#8201;%. This study highlights an innovative strategy to reduce reliance on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen in plastic waste depolymerization, promoting both sustainability and environmental protection.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;driven Active Transport Across a Liquid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe how a small&#8208;molecule catalyst can be transported against its concentration gradient, thanks to the energy provided by the chemical reaction it catalyzes. This non&#8208;equilibrium process builds macroscopic concentration gradients and can be triggered by the localized presence of co&#8208;catalysts. Spatial separation leads to simultaneous autocatalysis and negative feedback, connecting the worlds of molecular ratchets and nonlinear phenomena.







Abstract
Biology has mastered energy transduction, converting energy between various forms, and employing it to drive its vital processes. Central to this is the ability to use chemical energy for the active transport of substances, pumping ions and molecules across hydrophobic lipid membranes between aqueous (sub)cellular compartments. Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel&#8208;to&#8208;waste (i.&#8197;e., substrate&#8208;to&#8208;product) conversion results in catalysis&#8208;driven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a hydrophobic phase, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis&#8208;driven active transport and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cluster&#8208;Cluster Heterostructure Enabling Fast Hydrogen Evolution for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>

We report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. A strongly coupled Pt&#8722;NiOx cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure simultaneously modulates the coordination environment of Pt and Ni, and delivers fast alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The corresponding AEMWE device with an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading of 50&#8197;&#956;gPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibits by far the best electrochemical performance (1.90&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The results highlight the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon black has been extensively employed as the support for noble metal catalysts for electrocatalysis applications. However, the nearly catalytic inertness and weak interaction with metal species of carbon black are two major obstacles that hinder the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Herein, we report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. In the case of NiOx cluster&#8208;decorated carbon black, a strongly coupled cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure consisting of Pt clusters and NiOx clusters (Pt&#8722;NiOx/C) is formed and delivers greatly enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The NiOx clusters can not only accelerate the hydrogen evolution process as the co&#8208;catalyst, but also optimize the adsorption of H intermediates on Pt and stabilize the Pt clusters. Notably, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Pt&#8722;NiOx/C as the cathode catalyst (with a loading of only 50&#8197;&#956;gPt cm&#8722;2) delivers the most competitive electrochemical performance reported to date, requiring only 1.90&#8197;V to reach a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The results demonstrate the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Valence State Hydrogen Channel Enhances Sustained and Controllable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Diabetic Skin Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a novel valence&#8208;state hydrogen channel mechanism, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance of the CoP catalyst under neutral conditions has been significantly improved. Based on this catalyst, a flexible device with controllable hydrogen release has been developed, effectively accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of serious health issues, including prolonged skin inflammation and delayed wound healing, owing to inferior glucose control and suppression of the immune system. Although traditional hydrogen (H2) therapy is slightly effective, its ability to tailor the release of H2 on the skin is limited. Accordingly, this study proposed a novel strategy for electrocatalytic H2 release under neutral conditions to promote wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbit. Herein, a defect&#8208;engineered cobalt phosphide (CoP) catalyst was designed by introducing a neutral single&#8208;metal electrocatalytic Hydrogen valence state channel into CoP. By effectively regulating the formation and transfer of *H active species during the CoP catalytic process, a considerable enhancement in neutral electrocatalytic H2 evolution performance was achieved (&#8722;78.0&#8197;mV@&#8208;10.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Based on this superior catalytic performance, we developed a flexible electrode (namely, CoP/flexible gold electrode made by screen printing (FGSP) by combining a convenient electrolysis platform with continuous electrolyte supply and FGSP, enabling customized H2 release and accelerating wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbits. Notably, the designed flexible electrode features adjustable dimensions, interchangeable substrates, and material adaptability, meeting the diverse needs of clinical and basic research and demonstrating significant potential for applications in clinical medicine.

         <title>Promiscuity Guided Evolution of Decarboxylative Aldolases for Synthesis of Tertiary &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promiscuity guided evolution of the decarboxylative aldolase, UstD, resulted in an efficient biocatalyst for synthesis of tertiary &#947;&#8208;hydroxy non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Simultaneous collection of variant activity and promiscuity was enabled by competition screening during directed evolution. Changes in promiscuity effectively identified distal residues that influence catalysis, a longstanding challenge in protein engineering.







Abstract
Many applications of enzymes benefit from activity on structurally diverse substrates. Here, we sought to engineer the decarboxylative aldolase UstD to perform a challenging C&#8722;C bond forming reaction with ketone electrophiles. The parent enzyme had only low levels of activity, portending multiple rounds of directed evolution and a possibility that mutations may inadvertently increase the specificity of the enzyme for a single model screening substrate. We show how to intentionally guide UstD towards generality through multi&#8208;generational directed evolution using substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening (SUMS). Mutations outside of the active site that impact catalytic function were immediately revealed by shifts in promiscuity, even when the overall activity was lower. By re&#8208;targeting these distal residues that couple to the active site with saturation mutagenesis, broadly activating mutations were readily identified. When analyzing active site mutants, SUMS identified both specialist enzymes that would have more limited utility as well as generalist enzymes with complementary activity on diverse substrates. These new UstD enzymes catalyze convergent synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids bearing tertiary alcohol side chains. This methodology is easy to implement and enables the rapid and effective evolution of enzymes to catalyze desirable new functions.

         <title>Abstraction of Hydride from Alkanes and Dihydrogen by the Perfluorotrityl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of a perfluorotrityl cation (F15Tr+) as a salt with halogenated carborane anions. These salts are stable at ambient temperature in the solid state. As predicted by theoretical calculations, F15Tr+ displays remarkable propensity for abstraction of a hydride. It extracts a hydride rapidly from alkanes and slowly even from dihydrogen.







Abstract
Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient&#8208;temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C6F5)3C+ or F15Tr+) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F15Tr+ cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8722;CH2&#8722;groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.

         <title>Targeted Docking of Localized Hydrogen Bond for Efficient and Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted localized hydrogen bond docking mechanism, activated by polyhydroxy hexitol&#8208;based electrolyte, optimizes solvation structures and reorganizes localized hydrogen bond networks at the interface, thereby decreasing water activity and enhancing Zn2+ deposition kinetics and homogeneity for efficient and reversible zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Hydrogen bond (HB) chemistry, a pivotal feature of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, modulates electrochemical processes through weak electrostatic interactions among water molecules. However, significant challenges persist, including sluggish desolvation kinetics and inescapable parasitic reactions at the electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, associated with high water activity and strong Zn2+&#8208;solvent coordination. Herein, a targeted localized HB docking mechanism is activated by the polyhydroxy hexitol&#8208;based electrolyte, optimizing Zn2+ solvation structures via dipole interaction and reconstructing interfacial HB networks through preferential parallel adsorption. By combining in situ spectroscopic characterizations with theoretical calculations, we elucidate the dynamic evolution of localized HB networks, which enhance Zn2+ deposition kinetics and homogeneity, suppress water&#8208;induced side reactions, and mitigate vanadium framework collapse. Our findings support that the targeted HB docking strategy facilitates fast interfacial ion transport kinetics and enables high reversibility, with a substantially prolonged symmetric cell lifespan exceeding 5000&#8197;h. This work markedly advances the efficient and reversible zinc&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Low Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition of (00l)&#8208;Oriented Elemental Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first successful growth of elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 and Sb(SiMe3)3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a GPC of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle, is demonstrated. Films transitioned from island to full coverage, with a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) to the (003) plane. Metallic Bi was confirmed by XPS and TEM. The 2500&#8208;cycle film exhibited semimetallic behavior with a resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm.







Abstract
This study presents the first successful demonstration of growing elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 as the precursor and Sb(SiMe3)3 as the co&#8208;reactant. The films were deposited at a relatively low temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C, with a growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle. Island formation marked the initial growth stages, with surface coverage reaching around 80&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles and full coverage between 2000 and 2500&#8197;cycles. Morphological analysis revealed that the Bi grains expanded and became more defined as the number of ALD cycles increased. This coalescence is further supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which show a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) plane to the (003) plane as the film thickness increases. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of metallic Bi with minimal surface oxidation. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance measurements highlight the semimetallic nature of Bi, with a room temperature resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm for the 2500&#8197;cycles Bi.

&lt;p&gt;The first successful growth of elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Sb(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at 100&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a GPC of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle, is demonstrated. Films transitioned from island to full coverage, with a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) to the (003) plane. Metallic Bi was confirmed by XPS and TEM. The 2500-cycle film exhibited semimetallic behavior with a resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents the first successful demonstration of growing elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the precursor and Sb(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the co-reactant. The films were deposited at a relatively low temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C, with a growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle. Island formation marked the initial growth stages, with surface coverage reaching around 80&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles and full coverage between 2000 and 2500&#8197;cycles. Morphological analysis revealed that the Bi grains expanded and became more defined as the number of ALD cycles increased. This coalescence is further supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which show a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) plane to the (003) plane as the film thickness increases. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of metallic Bi with minimal surface oxidation. Temperature-dependent sheet resistance measurements highlight the semimetallic nature of Bi, with a room temperature resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm for the 2500&#8197;cycles Bi. Temperature-dependent sheet resistance was also associated with a transition in carrier-type dominance from holes at higher temperatures to electrones at lower temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tridecasaccharide Motif from Angelica Sinensis APS&#8208;1 II Polysaccharide with Anti&#8208;Leukemia Activity and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from A. sinensis APS&#8208;1 II with anti&#8208;leukemia activity has been synthesized for the first time by orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation and stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation strategies. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed that not only the 13&#8208;mer but also a 9&#8208;mer showed anti&#8208;leukemia activity.







Abstract
A polysaccharide APS&#8208;1 II from a medicinal plant Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels represents a potential therapeutic agent against leukemia. However, the synthetic accessibility of the highly branched and complex APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide with multiple 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages remains a difficult task, impeding the in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity relationship biological studies and the development of carbohydrates&#8208;based therapeutics against leukemia. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of tridecasaccharide repeating unit together with shorter sequences 4&#8208;mer, 6&#8208;mer and 9&#8208;mer from APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide via one&#8208;pot orthogonal glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded the potential issues such as aglycone transfer associated with one&#8208;pot assembly with thioglycosides. The synthetic pathway also features the following aspects: 1)&#8197;three contiguous and challenging 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;Fuc bonds were highly stereoselectively constructed via the newly developed stereoselective 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation method; 2)&#8197;several 1, 2&#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages were formed via neighboring group participation effect, while 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glc linkage was stereoselectively assembled via N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide reagent modulation; 3) the final [1+1+2+9] one&#8208;pot assembly of the target tridecasaccharide via strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates. Biological studies revealed that human leukemia K562 and mouse L1210&#8197;cells could be effectively inhibited by tridecasaccharide repeating unit and substructure nonasaccharide.

         <title>Tailoring the Surface Curvature of the Supporting Carbon to Tune the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zinc&#8208;Urea&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The strain&#8208;induced change in the charge redistribution and binding strength of *O2&#8722;, *OOH and *OH of Fe SA/NhcC contributes to the enhanced catalytic ORR/UOR activity. Due to a lower equilibrium potential for the UOR and the superior catalytic activity of Fe SA/NhcC, the zinc&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery delivers a low charge voltage, high energy efficiency and long lifespan compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic activities of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are associated with the varying atomic interactions through its characteristic coordination geometry. Yet, modulation of the surface curvature of carbon acting as a supporting body has not been investigated. Herein, we report the superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enhanced performance for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) of single Fe atoms anchored on a highly curved N&#8208;doped carbon dodecahedron with concave morphology (Fe SA/NhcC). Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy disclose that the curvature of the carbon support helps to shorten the bond length of Fe&#8722;N, spatially redistributing the charges around the Fe and thereby lowering the d&#8208;band center toward optimal adsorption for oxygenated species. The Fe SA/NhcC catalyst displays an ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926&#8197;V for ORR and a small potential difference of 0.686&#8197;V for bifunctional ORR/UOR. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery with the Fe SA/NhcC cathode displays robust discharge durability, excellent cycling lifespan and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work provides new insight into promoting the catalytic activity of SACs through varying the surface curvature of the supporting carbon, tailoring geometric configuration and electronic states of SACs.

         <title>Steady State Free Precession NMR without Fourier Transform: Redefining the Capabilities of 19F NMR as a Discovery Tool</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steady state free precession (SSFP) &#8211; Complete Reduction to Amplitude Frequency Tables (CRAFT) not only improves sensitivity, resolution and number of signals detected by NMR but can also dramatically reduce experiment times. This powerful approach unlocks the potential of NMR as a discovery tool, enabling unprecedented detection of fluorinated compounds in environmental and biological samples.







Abstract
The 2024 Zurich perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) summit reiterated the urgent need for non&#8208;selective analytical approaches for PFC detection. 19F NMR holds great potential, however, sensitivity limitations lead to long analysis times and/or the possibility of not detecting low concentration species. Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) NMR collects the signal in a steady state regime, allowing 100&#8217;s of acquisitions in the timespan of a single traditional NMR scan. Unfortunately, data truncation from SSFP leads to artifacts and spectral broadening with Fourier transform, hindering interpretation. When non&#8208;Fourier based time&#8208;domain analysis is used, namely, complete reduction to amplitude frequency tables (CRAFT), limitations of SSFP are eliminated while sensitivity gains are retained. This work introduces the combined approach, then applies it for the measurement of PFCs in environmental and biological samples. In all cases, the approach reduces analysis time from many hours to minutes and/or greatly increases the range of compounds detected. For example, when PFOA was spiked into human blood, the detection limit improved ~50&#8208;fold vs standard NMR, while in a standard mixture, the approach detected compounds missed by LC&#8208;MS/MS. The technique can be adapted to any nucleus providing a facile approach to reduce experiment time and improve sensitivity of NMR in general.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Actinide Oxo&#8208;Bond Manipulation in Actinyl Thiacalix[4]arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether &#8211; expanded calixarene actinyl ions [UO2]2+, [NpO2]2+ and [PuO2]2+ place the two trans&#8208;oxo groups in different environments. One is more accessible, so functionalization and redox reactions are explored to target a cis&#8208;dioxo uranyl ion. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically.

Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An=U, Np, Pu). The thioether calixarene TC4A (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to the actinyl cation forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans&#8208;oxo groups. The &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, [A]2[UO2(TC4A)] (A=[Li(DME)2], HNEt3) and [HNEt3]2[AnO2(TC4A)] (An=U, Np, Pu), enable selective oxo chemistry. Silylation of the UVI oxo groups by bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrazine occurs first at only the unencapsulated exo oxo and only one silylation is needed to enable migration of the endo oxo out of the cone, whereupon a second silylation affords the stable UIV cis&#8208;bis(siloxide) [A]2[U(OSiMe3)2(TC4A)]. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate&#160;oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically, at only 23&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1 in energy above the classical trans dioxo. Calculations for the transuranic cis[AnO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; (An=Np, Pu) are at higher energies, 30&#8211;35&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1, retaining the U complexes as the more obvious target for a cis&#8208;dioxo actinyl ion. The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as&#8208;yet unseen uranyl geometry as further bonding in the TC4A U&#8208;OAr groups stabilizes the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of the putative cis[UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; in this ligand framework.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting Dominated by Direct Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Cluster Photoexcitation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs involving photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) were constructed by carbazole dicarboxylic acid and trinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters. Direct LCCT&#8208;triggered photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) surpassed that achieved through indirect LCCT pathway. Direct LCCT was pivotal in promoting effective charge separation and transfer, maximizing the photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.







Abstract
Expanding the spectral response of photocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting (OWS) represents an effective approach for improving solar spectrum utilization efficiency. However, the majority of single&#8208;phase photocatalysts designed for OWS primarily respond to the ultraviolet region, which accounts for a small proportion of sunlight. Herein, we present a versatile strategy to achieve broad visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive OWS photocatalysis dominated by direct ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Three synthesized OWS MOFs, namely Fe2MCbz (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+), exhibited intrinsic OWS capability without the requirement for extra photosensitizer or sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. Among these, Fe2NiCbz was identified as the superior performer, and when dispersed with polyacrylonitrile nanofibers using electrospinning technology, it achieved the highest OWS rates of 170.2 and 85.1&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for H2 and O2 evolution, surpassing all previously documented MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that direct LCCT played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, with exceptional performance of Fe2NiCbz attributed to its well&#8208;optimized energy level structures and highly efficient charge transfer mechanism. This work not only sets a benchmark in OWS MOF photocatalysts but also paves the way for maximizing solar spectrum utilization, thereby advancing renewable hydrogen production strategy.

         <title>Sabatier Principle Inspired Bifunctional Alloy Interface for Stable and High&#8208;Depth Discharging Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

This work presents a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. The &#8216;just right&#8217; interaction between TM and Zn endows Cu@Zn electrodes with remarkable reversibility and uniform pre&#8208;stripping morphologies in aqueous Zn metal batteries cycling under high depth of discharging.







Abstract
Achieving stable Zn anodes that can effectively couple with Zn&#8208;free cathodes is essential for advancing high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries. Here, we propose a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. Among various TM&#8208;coated Zn (TM@Zn) electrodes, Cu@Zn exhibits the highest reversibility and structural stability, attributed to the optimal interaction between Cu and Zn. The heteroatomic interaction&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance parallels the Sabatier principle. Morphological analyses reveal that bare Zn anodes display detrimental etching pits during stripping, which is different from the uniform dissolution for Cu@Zn electrodes. During subsequent plating, the conductive interface serves as a secondary current collector for uniform Zn deposition in Cu@Zn, thus demonstrating a bifunctional nature. Atomic observations disclose the working mechanisms of this interface as a gradual phase transition from Cu to CuZn5 during cycling. The Cu@Zn anodes exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;h at a low current of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 250&#8197;h at a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. They also demonstrate practical feasibility by maintaining 88.7&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles in Cu@Zn||VO2 full cells. This work provides new insights into the Sabatier chemistry inspired bifunctional layers for Zn metal battery system.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Electron Leakage via An Artificial Rectified Layer for Longevous Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an artificial rectified layer with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features to inhibit electron leakage and homogenize ion/electron fields at the electrolyte/Zn anode interface, preventing the Zn anode from side reactions but promoting its (002) oriented deposition at high utilization and efficiency.







Abstract
Dendrites and water&#8208;induced side reactions impose greatly challenge on the implementation of aqueous zinc ion batteries. To tackle these problems, an artificial rectified layer (ARL) with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features was in situ synthesized on Zn surface rapidly to prevent the electron leakage from Zn anode to aqueous electrolyte, which is the underlying logic for uneven Zn deposition and parasitic side reactions. The ARL also displays a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.71 and can build fast Zn2+ transport channels to homogenize the interfacial ion flux and electric field according to the calculated work function and multi&#8208;physics phase simulation results. Therefore, the Zn anode with ARL shows preferred plating along with (002) crystal facet and an admirable Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 3200 cycles. Zn symmetric cells can withstand large current density up to 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operate stably at 44.2&#8201;% depth of discharge for 250&#8197;hours, surpassing most of published reports. The ARL also enables the Zn||MnO2 full batteries to circulate over 2600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This work provides a different perspective to comprehend and design satisfactory solid electrolyte interphase for Zn metal anodes.

The hollow&#8208;structured [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O dual vacancies, demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability and outstanding H2 evolution performance at low temperature in photothermal&#8208;driven methanol/water reforming







Abstract
To enable highly efficient in situ hydrogen release from methanol/water reforming at lower temperature, the integration of solar&#8208;energy offers a promising approach to activate methanol/water and substantially lower the activation energy of this reaction. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;vacancy defective hollow heterostructure derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O vacancies, for photothermal&#8208;promoted methanol solution reforming into hydrogen. The [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y exhibits exceptional photothermal H2 evolution activity, achieving a production rate of 215.2 mmolgcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1, 16&#8208;fold higher than its thermocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 66.8&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 1.1&#8201;% under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination, and excellent durability over 82&#8197;h, cumulating 2.61&#215;103 mmolgcat&#8722;1. The synergistic effects of dual&#8208;vacancies and the hollow heterostructure significantly enhance the photothermal effect, lowering the activation energy barrier for methanol/water, enabling H2 production at temperatures even as 80&#8201;&#176;C under non&#8208;alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the incorporated surface hydroxyl groups facilitate the generation of active surface hydroxyls from water, further driving activation and cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol, thereby markedly reducing the apparent reaction activation energy by 12.5&#8201;%. This work provides a new strategy for effective H2 production from aqueous methanol reforming under mild conditions, holding great promise for energy&#8208;demanding industrial applications.

         <title>Monitoring the Fate of Zn in the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst During CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Synthesis at High Conversions by Operando Spectroscopy</title>

Using an additively manufactured spectroscopic reactor to investigate the structure of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at high conversion. Restructuring of ZnO during high conversion and condensation was observed.







Abstract
In the frame of developing a sustainable chemical industry, heterogeneously catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted considerable interest. However, the Cu&#8722;Zn based catalyst system employed in this process is very dynamic, especially in the presence of the products methanol and water. Deactivation needs to be prevented, but its origin and mechanism are hardly investigated at high conversion where product condensation is possible. Here, we report on the structural dynamics of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst at 90&#8197;bar and 40&#8201;% CO2 conversion (at equilibrium conditions), investigated in a dedicated metal&#8208;based spectroscopic cell specially fabricated using additive manufacturing. This particular reactor configuration aims to mimic the high CO2 conversion part of the catalyst bed and can induce product condensation, which is monitored by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. While Cu remained mostly stable throughout the experiment, Zn underwent strong restructuring. The chosen reaction conditions, including the use of CO2 as carbon source and in situ product condensation, were selected to provide insights under industrial conditions. This work is highlighting the importance of spectroscopic investigations at high conversion levels, offering insights into chemical transformations during deactivation, extending the concept of spatially resolved studies, and thus providing guidance for the design of more stable catalysts.

         <title>Reaction of NHOs with Bisphosphanes &#8211; Designing Diradicaloids, Zwitterions and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins with a P&#8208;substituted indenyl heterocycle, it was possible to synthesize a very exciting new heterocyclic substance class that is both zwitterionic and diradical. The diradical character of these heterocycles can be adjusted by rotation within the molecule, which was achieved by rational design. The thermochromism of these heterocycles was studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Furthermore, we have shown that these heterocycles can activate small molecules. The mechanism of such an activation chemistry was studied and shown to be reversible in some case. Finally, we studied the electronic structure using multireference methods.







Abstract
The linkage of an imidazole&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), containing a terminal CH2 donor group, with a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradical molecular fragment leads to an open&#8208;shell singlet diphospha&#8208;indenylide system, a new class of P&#8208;heterocycles, which can be interpreted both as a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradicaloid and as a zwitterion with a permanent, overall charge separation between the N&#8208; and P&#8208;heterocyclic ring systems. The rotation of the imidazole ring, which is thermally possible due to a central C&#8722;C bond with a weakened &#960;&#8208;component, changes both the charge separation and diradical character depending on the dihedral angle, as quantum mechanical calculations indicate. By varying the bulkiness of substituents at the imidazole&#8208;based NHO, it was possible to obtain different diphospha&#8208;indenylide species with different rotation angles in the solid state and hence varying diradical character. Imidazolium&#8208;diphospha&#8208;indenylides represent a new class of NHO&#8208;based zwitterions with diradical character. Their synthesis, structure, and activation chemistry are described, as well as the quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure in these unusual heterocycles. In addition, along the synthesis route to diphospha&#8208;indenylide, we also succeeded in isolating a highly reactive monoradical anion, which was also fully characterized.

         <title>Rational Design of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues via 3&#8201;d Transition Metals Incorporation for Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) as anode materials for SIBs are designed by a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach through the rational incorporation of 3d transition metals. Among them, the CoV&#8208;PBA (CV) anode exhibits remarkable sodium&#8208;ion storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic modulation of its electronic structure through &#960;&#8208;electron regulation induced by vanadium incorporation.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt&#8208;M&#8208;based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs via a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate p&#8208;band center of cyanide linkages (&#8722;CN&#8722;) is more favorable for Na+ intercalation and diffusion, while the d&#8208;band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM&#8208;based PBAs, CoV&#8208;PBAs possess the best sodium&#8208;ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7&#8197;mAh/g at 30&#8197;A/g).

     alt="Rational Design of Cobalt-Based Prussian Blue Analogues via 3&#8201;d Transition Metals Incorporation for Superior Na-Ion Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Cobalt-Based Prussian blue analogues (CoM-PBAs) as anode materials for SIBs are designed by a universal low-energy co-precipitation approach through the rational incorporation of 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; transition metals. Among them, the CoV-PBA (CV) anode exhibits remarkable sodium-ion storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic modulation of its electronic structure through &#960;-electron regulation induced by vanadium incorporation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt-M-based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM-PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a universal low-energy co-precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-band center of cyanide linkages (&#8722;CN&#8722;) is more favorable for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation and diffusion, while the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM-based PBAs, CoV-PBAs possess the best sodium-ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7&#8197;mAh/g at 30&#8197;A/g). &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;ex situ&lt;/i&gt; techniques further demonstrate that the &#960;-electron regulation by V introduction enhances the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions. Moreover, the study identified the &#8220;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-band center&#8221; and &#8220;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center&#8221; may serve as key descriptors for quantifying the capability and stability of other-type bimetal Co-based anodes (oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) with similar theoretical capacity, offering a potentially transformative approach for selecting practical SIB electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exceptional Battery&#8208;level Safety of High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Non&#8208;Flammable and Low&#8208;Exothermic Localize High Concentration Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localize high concentration electrolyte (code: E&#8208;SE&#8208;F) with non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity was formulated. Thanks to these features, the safety performance of high energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs) was significantly enhanced. The LHCE also improved the electrochemical performance of LIBs because of its excellent interphasial and interfacial stability.







Abstract
The poor safety performance of high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is drawing increasing public concern. To enhance the safety performance on the battery level, it is indispensable to design safe electrolytes that are both non&#8208;flammable and low exothermic under abusive conditions. By rational design, a safe localize high concentration electrolyte (LHCE) with non&#8208;flammability and extremely low exothermicity is formulated. Compared with conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocabonate electrolytes and previous LHCEs, the heat generated by the reaction between the safe LHCE and fully charged electrodes under abusive conditions is significantly reduced. Because of the non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity of the safe LHCE, high energy density LIB (1800&#8197;mAh Gr||LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, fully charged to 4.3&#8197;V) with the safe LHCE successfully passes the nail penetration test. Because of the excellent interphasial properties of the safe LHCE, the cycle life and the rate capability of high energy density LIBs are significantly improved when the safe LHCE is adopted. This work sheds light on the design principles of electrolytes for achieving battery&#8208;level safety.

         <title>Force&#8208;Trainable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Enabled by Mechanophore&#8208;Induced Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have showed an example for active smart materials that can exchange substances with the surroundings to gain the training &amp; learning capability enabled by covalently integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile in the main chain of a single&#8208;network liquid crystal elastomer (LCE). After being trained in different &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;, additional polymer chains grafted to the original liquid crystal networks form through the mechano&#8208;radical induced polymerization. As a result, the LCE can improve the actuation performance and learn new functions that it does not intrinsically have, which is determined by the characteristics of the &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;.







Abstract
In nature, organisms adapt to environmental changes through training to learn new abilities, offering valuable insights for developing intelligent materials. However, replicating this &#8220;adaptive learning&#8221; in synthetic materials presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a feasible approach to train liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile into their main chain, addressing the challenge of enabling synthetic materials to exchange substances with their environment. Inspired by biological training, the LCEs can self&#8208;strengthen and acquire new functionalities through mechanical stress&#8208;induced radical polymerization. The research not only enhances the mechanical performance of LCEs, but also endows them with the ability to learn properties such as flexibility, light responsiveness, and fluorescence. These advancements are crucial for overcoming the limitations of current materials, paving the way for the creation of advanced intelligent soft materials with autonomous self&#8208;improvement, akin to the adaptive skills of living organisms.

         <title>Photochromic Color Tuning of Copper&#8208;Doped Zinc Sulfide Nanocrystals by Control of Local Dopant Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study achieved tunable photochromic colors (gray to brown) in Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals by controlling surface Zn and S stoichiometry using thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Experiments and quantum chemical calculations revealed that Cu distribution on Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surfaces determines color, with minimal influence from particle size or Cu concentration.







Abstract
Inorganic photochromic materials offer several advantages over organic compounds, including relatively inexpensive and higher thermal stability. However, tuning their color with the same component has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that the photochromic color of Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals (NCs), which is initially pale yellow before light irradiation, can be tuned from gray to brown by adjusting the surface stoichiometry of Zn and S, which is controlled through the use of thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Several experiments and quantum chemical calculations using model clusters revealed that the color change is determined by the distribution of Cu, which significantly contributes to the coloration, specifically whether it resides on the Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surface. In contrast, particle size and Cu concentration were found to have little effect on the photochromic color. This study expands the diversity of photochromic responses in inorganic NCs and marks an important step toward the development of further advanced photochromic nanomaterials.

A novel photochemical afterglow system was constructed through structural design and coordination, lighting up the weak&#8208;emissive fluorophore in the form of afterglow through chemiexcitation. Ultimately, a system with a highest reported afterglow luminescence QY of 27.5&#8201;% was accomplished and successfully applied in high SBR in vivo bioimaging and highly sensitive in vitro diagnostic of SAA through lateral flow immunoassay.

Abstract
Photochemical afterglow materials are gaining great attention for the property to continuously emit light after the excitation source is removed. However, their limited luminescence quantum yield (QY) and brightness hinder the use in biological applications. In this study, we introduce a novel photochemical afterglow system that combines a newly designed photoenergy cache unit (PCU) with an emitter through coordination covalent bonds. The PCU boasts a dark state to significantly emit photons only through chemiexcitation in the process of photochemical reactions, facilitating direct energy transfer to the emitter and resulting in bright afterglow. The related mechanisms further guided us to achieve the highest reported afterglow luminescence quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;%. The system can be encapsulated and dispersed in aqueous solutions for in vivo bioimaging in living mice under mild and simple conditions (low concentration, low excitation power, short excitation time, short exposure time), and also for in vitro diagnostic through lateral flow immunoassay, enabling the highly sensitive detection of the inflammatory biomarker serum amyloid A (SAA) and demonstrating excellent correlation with clinical test results. This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such systems for further biomedical applications.

This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such systems for further biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Targeted Photoactivation of Ion Channels in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system using oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im) to activate TRPM2 Ca2+ channels by O2&#8901;&#8722; without relying on external light. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targets cell membranes, activating TRPM2 channels and causing intracellular calcium overload, leading to mitochondrial damage, autophagy inhibition, and apoptosis of cells and tumor spheroid. This strategy provides a new method for regulating ion channels and oxidative stress in living cells.







Abstract
The regulation of oxidative stress in living cells is essential for maintaining cellular processes and signal transduction. However, developing straightforward strategies to activate oxidative stress&#8208;sensitive membrane channels in situ poses significant challenges. In this study, we present a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system based on a conjugated oligomer, oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im), designed for the activation of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) calcium channels in situ by superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) without requiring external light sources. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targeted the cell membrane efficiently, leading to the activation of TRPM2 channels in situ by the CRET process and subsequent intracellular calcium overload. This cascade resulted in mitochondrial damage and inhibition of autophagy, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. Additionally, this strategy could be applied for the selective killing of tumor cells that overexpress TRPM2 ion channels and for inhibiting the growth of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids. Our system offers a novel approach for regulating ion channel activity and oxidative stress in living cells compared to optogenetics and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Multiple Post&#8208;Translational Modifications in Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple and efficient nanopore sensing strategy based on host&#8208;guest interactions for detecting PTMs. It can identify 13 types of PTMs at specific peptide positions and is further enhanced by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling differentiation of various PTMs, positional isomers, and multiple PTMs on the target peptide.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Despite their significance, only a few PTMs have been extensively studied at the proteome level, primarily due to the scarcity of reliable, convenient, and low&#8208;cost sensing methods. Here, we present a straightforward and effective strategy for detecting PTMs on short peptides through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;assisted nanopore sensing. Our results demonstrate that the identity of 13 types of PTMs in a specific position of a phenylalanine&#8208;containing peptide could be determined via current blockage during translocation of the peptide through &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. Furthermore, we extend this strategy by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling the discrimination of various PTMs, positional isomers, and even multiple PTMs on the target peptide. With ongoing improvements, our method holds promise for practical applications in sensing PTMs in biologically relevant samples, offering an efficient alternative to traditional mass spectrometry approaches.

         <title>Robust Mechanically Interlocked Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust mechanically interlocked network ionogel (IGMIN) with improved toughness, high strength, and impact resistance was developed by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Its stable performance as sewable strain sensors for robot gait monitoring highlights its practical potential, offering a new strategy for toughening ionogels and advancing mechanically interlocked materials.







Abstract
Ionogels have attracted considerable attention as versatile materials due to their unique ionic conductivity and thermal stability. However, relatively weak mechanical performance of many existing ionogels has hindered their broader application. Herein, we develop robust, tough, and impact&#8208;resistant mechanically interlocked network ionogels (IGMINs) by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Profiting from the dynamic yet stable nature of the mechanically interlocked networks, IGMINs exhibit high tensile strength (9.6&#8197;MPa), fracture energy (39&#8197;kJ/m2), and toughness (25.9&#8197;MJ/m3), along with a high elongation rate (473&#8201;%) and excellent impact resistance and shape memory, resulting in overall performance that surpasses most reported ionogels. Furthermore, in the application of strain sensors for monitoring the gait of crawling robots, the toughness and robustness of IGMINs ensure their ability to consistently output stable electrical signals during the stretching and contraction processes, thereby highlighting their practical application potential. Our work provides a new research strategy for toughening ionogels and promotes the development of mechanically interlocked materials.

         <title>Reconfiguring Terminal Species of Bituminous Coal to Steer Hard Carbon toward High&#8208;Capacity and Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment to construct hard carbon with expanded carbon interlayer spacing and plentiful ultramicropores/closed pores. A large specific capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved along with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and excellent rate/cycling performance.







Abstract
Hard carbons derived from coal precursors have shown bright industrial prospect as the low cost anode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is of extreme necessity yet challenge to regulate carbon microstructure toward superior sodium energy storage. In this study, we propose a powerful chemical reconfiguration tactic to steer hard carbons toward high&#8208;capacity and fast sodium storage. The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment for effectively inhibiting the reordering of carbon layers under high temperature, thereby creating rich ultramicropores/closed pores and expanded interlayer spacing. These structural merits enable the hard carbon to garner an enhanced capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and long lifespan. More impressively, the sodium storage kinetics is substantially sped up with a large capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 retained at a high&#8208;rate of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work will afford a fresh methodology for precursor modulation to accelerate the real&#8208;world practice of hard carbons toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

The most stable complex of radioantimony yet reported under physiological conditions, [117Sb][Sb(TREN&#8208;CAM)]&#8211;, is demonstrated through a combination of radiochemical and structural studies, in vitro challenges, and in vivo SPECT and PET imaging in mice. These results mark an exciting leap towards implementing the elementally matched pair 117/119Sb in targeted Auger theranostics of cancer.







Abstract
Antimony&#8208;119 (119Sb) is one of the most attractive Auger&#8208;electron emitters identified to date, but it remains practically unexplored for targeted radiotherapy because no chelators have been identified to stably bind this metalloid in vivo. In a departure from current studies focused on chelator development for Sb(III), we explore the chelation chemistry of Sb(V) using the tris&#8208;catecholate ligand TREN&#8208;CAM. Through a combination of radiolabeling, spectroscopic, solid&#8208;state, and computational studies, the radiochemistry and structural chemistry of TREN&#8208;CAM with 1XX/natSb(V) were established. The resulting [1XXSb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remained intact for several days in human serum, signifying high stability under biological conditions. Finally, the first in vivo single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging studies were carried out using 117Sb, the diagnostic analogue of 119Sb. These studies revealed marked differences in the uptake and distribution of activity in mice administered unchelated [117Sb]Sb(OH)6&#8211; versus [117Sb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM, suggesting that 117Sb is largely retained by TREN&#8208;CAM over the time course of the study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the most physiologically stable complex of no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added 1XXSb yet reported, offering new promise for the clinical implementation of radioantimony in nuclear medicine. Our results also establish the feasibility of 117Sb as an elementally matched partner to 119Sb for theranostic applications.

Description: The capacity and energy density of manganese metal batteries are greatly enhanced by developing the first cathode based on dual storage mechanism in this work.







Abstract
As a promising post lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery candidate, manganese metal battery (MMB) is receiving growing research interests because of its high volumetric capacity, low cost, high safety and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the low energy density, mainly constrained by scarce choices and unsatisfying capacity of cathodes, strictly bottlenecks the development of MMBs. In this work, a new class of cathodes based on novel dual&#8208;storage mechanism (DSM) are reported. Working principles of DSM are revealed and deeply understood via ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DSM&#8208;based Cu1.8S cathode, which shows the highest specific capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 97.1&#8201;% higher energy density than previously reported cathodes in storing Mn2+ ions, is presented. The key determinants on DSM and design strategies for next&#8208;generation cathodes are revealed via theoretical calculations. This work provides a new class of high&#8208;capacity cathode materials for MMBs, which is expected to draw inspirations to further enhance the energy density of MMBs.

         <title>Taming the Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction via Rational Diluent Selection for Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new selection principle based on the diluent selection parameter (DSP, the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+) is proposed for admirable diluent selection. Diluents with larger DSP are more apt to tame ion&#8208;dipole interaction, improving the Li reversibility and low&#8208;temperature stability. This work provides new guidance to develop novel diluents for long&#8208;cycle Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing advanced electrolytes with high Li affinity is crucial for achieving long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the strong Li+&#8208;solvent interactions in conventional electrolytes often induce difficult Li+ desolvation especially under low&#8208;temperature conditions, resulting in the formation of fragile electrode interfaces involving solvents, and thus dissatisfactory cycling stability of LMBs. Herein, by introducing various diluents into the lithium hexafluorophosphate in 1, 2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte, we reveal that Li+ desolvation is influenced by not only the diluent&#8208;solvent interaction but also the diluent&#8208;anion interaction. Based on these findings, a diluent selection parameter (DSP), which is calculated based on the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+, is proposed for diluent selection. A diluent with a larger DSP is more favorable for promoting Li+ desolvation and improving the low&#8208;temperature performance of LMBs. With the rationally selected 1, 2&#8208;dichloroethane diluent (DSP=3.95), the Li

         <title>Regulating Interphase Chemistry by Targeted Functionalization of Hard Carbon Anode in Ester&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The inherent high reactive oxygen&#8208;functional groups of hard carbon (HC) anode are strategically converted into a stable Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer for regulating uncontrollable interfacial redox reaction energy and charge transfer, suppressing the interfacial side reactions, and contributing to the construction of inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial resistance and enhanced cycling durability.







Abstract
Commercial hard carbon (HC) anode suffers from unexpected interphase chemistry rooted in the parasitic reactions between surface oxygen&#8208;functional groups and ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to regulate interphase chemistry by tailoring targeted functional groups on the HC surface, where highly active undesirable oxygen&#8208;functional groups are skillfully converted into a Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer favorable for anchoring anions. Then, an inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhanced cycling durability is constructed successfully. Consequently, the modified HC anode delivers an excellent rate capability of 206.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the coin&#8208;type full&#8208;cell equipped with Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode exhibits an exceptional capacity retention ratio of 80.9&#8201;% after 800 cycles at 1C. The present simple and effective interfacial modification strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for promoting the development and practicability of HC anode in ester&#8208;based electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>SN2&#8722;Reaction&#8722; Bonding&#8208;Heterointerface Strengthens Buried Adhesion and Orientation for Advanced Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel SN2&#8722;reaction&#8722;driven bonding&#8208;heterointerface to strengthen the buried adhesion and orientation of perovskite film by simultaneously functionalizing the underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework. Benefiting from the reinforcement of buried adhesion and target&#8722;point&#8722;oriented crystallization, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8722;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
Traditionally weak buried interaction without customized chemical bonding always goes against the formation of high&#8208;&#8722;quality perovskite film that highly determines the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. To address this issue, herein, we propose a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2) driving strategy to idealize the robust buried interface by simultaneously decorating underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework with iodoacetamide and thiol molecules, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that a strong SN2 reaction between exposed halogen and thiol group in two molecules occurs, which not only benefits the reinforcement of buried adhesion, but also triggers target&#8208;point&#8208;oriented crystallization, synergistically upgrading the upper perovskite film quality and accelerating interfacial charge extraction&#8211;transfer behavior. Benefiting from the suppressed nonradiative recombination, as a result, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8211;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;%, more importantly, with significantly prolonged long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. This unique reaction&#8211;driven buried interface provides a new path for manipulating perovskite growth and obtaining advanced perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>The Proximal Protonation Source in Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C Single Atom Catalysts Selectively Boosts CO2 to Methane Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise functional group modulation of the coordinating N atom (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) to Cu2+ in a purpose&#8208;designed single atom catalyst with the active center Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C embedded in reduced graphene oxide proves the critical protonation role of the proximal N&#8722;H moiety for CO2 hydrogenation, leading to exceptional electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance.







Abstract
Regulating the coordination environment of active sites has proved powerful for tapping into their catalytic activity and selectivity in homogeneous catalysis, yet the heterogeneous nature of copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) makes it challenging. This work reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to construct a SAC (rGO@Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C) by inlaying preformed amine coordinated Cu2+ units into reduced graphene oxide (rGO), permitting molecular level revelation on how the proximal N&#8208;site functional groups (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) impact on the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). It is demonstrated that the N&#8722;H moiety of rGO@Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C can serve as an in situ protonation agent to accelerate the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methane reduction kinetics, delivering a methane current density (163&#8197;mA/cm2) 2.42&#8208;times that with the &#8208;CH3 substituted counterpart rGO@Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations elucidate that the high methane faradaic efficiency (77.1&#8201;%) achieved here is enabled by opening up the energetically favorable formyl pathway (*OCHO pathway) against the traditional *CO pathway that normally leads to various CO2RR products other than methane. Our strategy sets the stage to precisely modulate single&#8208;atom catalysts for efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Paired Photoproduction of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;Dihydroisoquinoline Over Covalent Pyrene&#8208;(Thio)urea Frameworks with Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) with electron push&#8208;pull effect were successfully synthesized and served as efficient paired photosynthesis catalysts of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) products. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with higher THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) and DHIQ selectivity.







Abstract
Pairing photocatalytic 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction (THIQ&#8208;SDR) with two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a green solar to chemical strategy by simultaneously utilizing the photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes. However, it is still short of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst to drive two reactions above. In the present work, crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) were synthesized and demonstrated as high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. In particular, COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light and finally solid H2O2 products (Na2CO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O2) was collected after long&#8208;time irradiation. Under natural sunlight conditions, the H2O2 production rate over COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S further increased to ~51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, among the best COF photocatalysts. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S also showed high THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) with 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) selectivity of ~92&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations reveal stronger electron push&#8208;pull effect of COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S than COF&#8722;Py&#8722;O, enhancing its photoinduced charge carries, and a four&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR mechanism with thiourea as the active sites has been confirmed as well as the mechanism of THIQ&#8208;SDR to DHIQ, featuring lower energy barriers for O2 adsorption and *HOOH desorption over thiourea units. This work provides a paired photosynthesis strategy of H2O2 and DHIQ over high&#8208;efficiency pyrene&#8208;(thio)urea COF photocatalysts with electron push&#8208;pull effect.

         <title>Assisted Solubilization Strategy in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Thermally and Mechanically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assisted solubilization strategy by employing supramolecular polymerization network of deep eutectic solvent has been innovatively developed in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD to dissolve LiTFSI without conventional acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine. The molecular network inhibits Li+ ions migration and strengthens adhesion at perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/electrode interface, thus simultaneously improving thermal and mechanical stabilities under severe conditions.







Abstract
The ions migration and de&#8208;doping reactions caused by conventional doping seriously jeopardizes the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as hole transport layer (HTL), which poses a significant challenge for subsequent commercialization. To address these issues, a novel assisted solubilization strategy has been firstly developed using deep eutectic solvent (DES) synthesized from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)acetamide (NCMA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). NCMA can form multiple strong interaction modes with LiTFSI through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding and Li&#8722;O/Li&#8722;N coordination, which effectively inhibits Li+ ions migration at high temperature and increases solubility of LiTFSI in chlorobenzene without acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP), fundamentally solving de&#8208;doping reaction. In addition, the molecular network with abundant functional groups in DES improves fracture energy of perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interface and enhances interfacial adhesion via strong chelation with perovskite and Ag electrode. Consequently, benefiting from tBP removement and inhibited ions migration, the optimized PVSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.02&#8201;%, and the unencapsulated device retains over 90&#8201;% of initial PCE at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 40&#8201;% RH for 1200&#8197;h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 standard). This innovative assisted solubilization strategy represents a critical step toward improving device stability and accelerating the commercialization of PVSCs.

     alt="Assisted Solubilization Strategy in Spiro-OMeTAD for Thermally and Mechanically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assisted solubilization strategy by employing supramolecular polymerization network of deep eutectic solvent has been innovatively developed in spiro-OMeTAD to dissolve LiTFSI without conventional acetonitrile and 4-tert-butylpyridine. The molecular network inhibits Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions migration and strengthens adhesion at perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/electrode interface, thus simultaneously improving thermal and mechanical stabilities under severe conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ions migration and de-doping reactions caused by conventional doping seriously jeopardizes the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on spiro-OMeTAD as hole transport layer (HTL), which poses a significant challenge for subsequent commercialization. To address these issues, a novel assisted solubilization strategy has been firstly developed using deep eutectic solvent (DES) synthesized from N-(cyanomethyl)acetamide (NCMA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). NCMA can form multiple strong interaction modes with LiTFSI through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding and Li&#8722;O/Li&#8722;N coordination, which effectively inhibits Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions migration at high temperature and increases solubility of LiTFSI in chlorobenzene without acetonitrile and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), fundamentally solving de-doping reaction. In addition, the molecular network with abundant functional groups in DES improves fracture energy of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface and enhances interfacial adhesion via strong chelation with perovskite and Ag electrode.

         <title>Topological Supramolecular Complexation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Tunable Interconnected Hierarchical Microporosity in Amorphous Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed to generate frustrated packing for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. Secondary building units with cuboctahedron and tetrahedron geometry are complexed through hydrogen bonding and coordination interaction while the mis&#8208;match of the two topologies disfavor the dense packing of the structural units, and extrinsic porosity can be obtained.







Abstract
The precise engineering of microporosity is challenging due to the interference at the sub&#8208;nm scale from unexpected structural flexibility and molecular packing. Herein, the concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. The 2.5&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) are complexed with quadridentate ligands through hydrogen and coordination bonding while the mismatch between the MOPs&#8217; cuboctahedron and ligands&#8217; tetrahedron topology leads to frustrated packing with extrinsic microporosity. Amorphous supramolecular frameworks can be obtained that integrate the intrinsic microporosity of the MOPs with the extrinsic porosity from the frustrated packing. The topologies, sizes and flexibility of ligands as well as ligand/MOP ratios are systemically varied, and the pore size distribution can be precisely adjusted. The hierarchical structures ranging from molecular packing to the morphologies of meso&#8208;scale assemblies are probed using ultra&#8208;small, small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, enabling the quantitative evaluation of the micropores interconnectivity for the understanding of gas permeation performance. Gas separation membranes with permselectivity surpassing the Robeson upper bound can be designed. The findings not only give insight into the microscopic mechanism of supramolecular frustrated packing from topological design, but also pave new avenues for the cost&#8208;effective fabrications of microporous frameworks.

         <title>Shifting Lithium Amide Reactivity to the Radical Domain: Regioselective Radical C&#8722;H Functionalization of 3&#8208;Iodooxetane for the Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Strained spirocyclic 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes were synthesized via a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to a series of non&#8208;enolizable ketones generating a frustrated radical pair&#8208;like N&#8208;centered radical and ketyl radical anion. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental investigations support the proposed mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
Strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles (SSHs) have gained significant attention within the medicinal chemistry community as promising sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres for their aromatic and non&#8208;spirocyclic counterparts. We herein report access to an unprecedented spiro&#8208;heterocycle&#8212;1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane. Our synthetic approach leverages a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to benzophenones generating an N&#8208;centered radical and a ketyl radical anion&#8212;reminiscent of a frustrated radical pair. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating an exergonic radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. This process enables the formation of the desired bond between the oxetane core and benzophenone derivatives, ultimately yielding the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane core. The stability and synthetic utility of the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane motif are showcased. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation is presented, including cyclic voltammetry studies, as well as computational calculations and experiments to support the mechanism of this new single electron synthetic tactic.

         <title>Amplified Production of a DNA Decoy Catalyzed by Intracellular MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved the amplified intracellular production of a DNA decoy targeting NF&#8208;&#954;B using a hairpin DNA circuit known as catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). This system is catalyzed by oncogenic miR&#8208;21 to produce the NF&#8208;&#954;B decoy, thereby inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B with high cancer specificity. Our approach holds great potential for efficient cancer therapy and as a personalized drug discovery system based on miRNA expression profiles.







Abstract
DNA decoys inhibit cellular transcription factors and are expected to be among the nucleic acid drugs used to downregulate the transcription process. However, spatially controlling the on/off efficacy of DNA decoys to avoid side effects on normal cells is challenging. To reduce undesired decoy function in normal cells, we adopted catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to produce a DNA duplex from a hairpin DNA pair in response to a specific microRNA (miRNA). We designed the DNA hairpin pairs to form a DNA decoy that binds to nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#8208;&#954;B), whose overexpression is related to many diseases, including cancer. The transformation of the DNA hairpin pair to the NF&#8208;&#954;B DNA decoy was catalyzed by miR&#8208;21, which is expressed in various types of cancers. Intracellular CHA progression and the inhibitory effect against NF&#8208;&#954;B were observed only in miR&#8208;21 overexpressing cancer cells. The intracellular miR&#8208;21&#8208;catalyzed production of the NF&#8208;&#954;B DNA decoy has the potential to reduce side effects on normal cells, thereby strengthening the therapeutic profile of the CHA&#8208;decoy system. The ability to customize the combination of catalytic miRNA and target transcription factors would allow our technology to serve as a &#8220;personalized drug discovery system&#8221; for a variety of challenging diseases, including cancer.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Multicatalytic Decarbonylation of Aldehydes Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;for&#8208;one decarbonylation: two metal&#8208;free multicatalytic decarbonylation processes of either secondary or tertiary aliphatic aldehydes are reported for the first time. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various functionalities and applied to complex molecules. Importantly, these processes are orthogonal and allow the selective decarbonylation of mixtures of aldehydes.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free dual photo&#8208; and organocatalytic decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes is described for the first time. On the one hand, a wide range of tertiary aldehydes are smoothly decarbonylated thanks to the combination of thioxanthone as photocatalyst and diphenyl disulfide as organocatalyst. On the other hand, by simply using 4&#8208;CzIPN as photocatalyst instead of thioxanthone, various secondary aldehydes readily undergo decarbonylation in an orthogonal manner, via the in situ formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines. Both methodologies are compatible with various functional groups and are readily applied to the decarbonylation of complex molecules.

On the other hand, by simply using 4-CzIPN as photocatalyst instead of thioxanthone, various secondary aldehydes readily undergo decarbonylation in an orthogonal manner, via the in situ formation of 1,4-dihydropyridines. Both methodologies are compatible with various functional groups and are readily applied to the decarbonylation of complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Isomerism of {Ag14}10+ Nanocluster Encapsulated by Bowl&#8208;like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented structural isomerism of {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters is for the first time observed in bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated silver nanoclusters, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2. Such structural isomerism effect endows two clusters with distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties.







Abstract
The structural isomerism of atomically precise nanoclusters provides a preeminent theoretical model to investigate the structure&#8722;property relationships. Herein, we synthesized three bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;encapsulated Ag nanoclusters (denoted as {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1&#8201;a, and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2) via a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Among them, for the first time, an unprecedented isomeric {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters are obtained in polyoxoanions {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2, which should be probably induced by the different distribution of coordinating O atoms in two isomeric bowl&#8208;like {Sb3W30} ligands. Clusters {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2 exhibit distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties due to the different geometric structures of the {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters, but both clusters can effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with over 22,000 turnovers (TONs) after 6&#8208;hour photocatalysis.

         <title>Rational Design Two&#8208; or Four&#8208;Electron Reaction Pathway Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron reaction pathway covalent organic framework has been synthesized to boost H2O2 yield by replacing bipyridine N with biphenyl C atoms, which lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates in oxygen reduction reaction process and achieves high faraday efficiency and highly selective hydrogen peroxide production.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are often employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide production due to their tunable structures and compositions. However, COF electrocatalysts require precise structural engineering, such as heteroatoms or metal site doping, to modulate the reaction pathway during the ORR process. In this work, we designed a tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;phenylenediamine based COF electrocatalyst, namely TPDA&#8208;BDA, which exhibited excellent two&#8208;electron (2e) ORR performance with high H2O2 selectivity of 89.7&#8201;% and faraday efficiency (FE) of 86.7&#8201;%, higher than the reported COFs to date for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier for reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates was significantly reduced by replacing of bipyridine with biphenyl blocks, changing from 4e to 2e ORR reaction pathway. Also, the donor&#8208;acceptor characteristic and narrower optical band gap of TPDA&#8208;BDA COF enhanced the electronic conductivity and reduction ability, thus elevating the catalytic activity. As a result, the H2O2 selectivity was maintained above 85&#8201;% even after 50&#8197;h stability test. This work reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship of COF electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for rational design of high performance 2e ORR COF electrocatalysts for efficient and selective hydrogen peroxide production.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction toward C2+ Products and CH4 by Regulating the Dimerization and Protonation in Platinum/Copper Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with C2+ FE reaching 70.4&#8201;% and CH4 FE reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. We believe that our work could inspire new opportunities for designing and developing catalysts for highly selective and efficient reactions.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu&#8208;Pt1 and Cu&#8208;PtNPs) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 70.4&#8201;% and the FE of CH4 reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt1 sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while PtNPs exhibit *CO tolerance for H2O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu&#8208;Pt1, while *CHO on Cu&#8208;PtNPs might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu&#8208;Pt1 would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C2+ products while PtNPs supplementarily accelerate H2O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH4. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO2 conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Application of Chiral Spirocyclic Bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral spirocyclic bisindoles have been designed and synthesized by asymmetric spirocyclization of the corresponding linear ketones by either chiral phosphoric acid catalysis or Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation followed by simple Lewis acid catalysis. These enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles have been demonstrated as useful chiral backbones for effective chiral catalysts that show good performance in both transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
While modifications of the privileged catalyst backbones, such as 1,1&#8217;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8217;&#8208;diol (SPINOL), have led to the development of diverse useful chiral catalysts, the incorporation of heteroarenes in such chiral spirocyclic structures has limitedly known. Herein we report the design of a type of chiral spirocyclic bisindole skeletons where the electronically distinct heteroarenes serve as direct anchor for functional sites. Separate approaches for the synthesis of two different families of such skeletons have been developed via chiral phosphoric acid and rhodium catalysis, respectively. Both strategies provided expedient access to the highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles, owing to not only the high nucleophilicity of the indole ring, but also the robust asymmetric control. These new skeletons have been demonstrated as backbones of effective chiral catalysts for both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.

     alt="Design, Synthesis and Application of Chiral Spirocyclic Bisindoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral spirocyclic bisindoles have been designed and synthesized by asymmetric spirocyclization of the corresponding linear ketones by either chiral phosphoric acid catalysis or Rh-catalyzed asymmetric arylation followed by simple Lewis acid catalysis. These enantioenriched spiro-bisindoles have been demonstrated as useful chiral backbones for effective chiral catalysts that show good performance in both transition-metal catalysis and organocatalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While modifications of the privileged catalyst backbones, such as 1,1&#8217;-spirobiindane-7,7&#8217;-diol (SPINOL), have led to the development of diverse useful chiral catalysts, the incorporation of heteroarenes in such chiral spirocyclic structures has limitedly known. Herein we report the design of a type of chiral spirocyclic bisindole skeletons where the electronically distinct heteroarenes serve as direct anchor for functional sites. Separate approaches for the synthesis of two different families of such skeletons have been developed via chiral phosphoric acid and rhodium catalysis, respectively. Both strategies provided expedient access to the highly enantioenriched spiro-bisindoles, owing to not only the high nucleophilicity of the indole ring, but also the robust asymmetric control. These new skeletons have been demonstrated as backbones of effective chiral catalysts for both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Hot Exciton Fluorescence and Multi&#8208;Source Excitation Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot exciton fluorescence and long afterglow emission were realized in the complexes by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly strategy. The complexes emitted bright afterglow after excited by 365&#8197;nm, 450&#8197;nm, white LED and even 800&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared laser under atmospheric conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic complexes with long afterglow luminescence have attracted extensive attention due to potential applications in display, sensing and information security. However, most of the metal&#8208;organic complex long afterglow materials reported so far are limited to the use of UV light as the excitation source, and the ambiguity of the structure&#8208;activity relationship makes the development of metal&#8208;organic complexes extremely limited. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic complexes with ultralong emission lifetime is constructed by coordination assembly of Zn(II) with three isomers. These complexes can emit afterglow when excited by UV light, blue LED, cell phone flashlight or even near&#8208;infrared light (800&#8197;nm) under ambient conditions, and the afterglow is also observed at 360&#8197;K. More interestingly, the inactivation pathway of the triplet exciton was altered by the strategy of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to these complexes having hot exciton fluorescence (HEF) emission that is not present in the ligand. The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.

Two new families of high&#8208;nuclearity coordination clusters [M120RE96] (M = Co and Ni, PCC&#8208;216MR) and [Co144Gd156] (PCC&#8208;300CG) with porous structure, high stability in solution were successfully isolated, demonstrating a superior reactivity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO under visible light.







Abstract
We report herein two families of porous coordination clusters (PCCs) with 216 nuclearity (M120RE96 or PCC&#8208;216MR) and 300 nuclearity (Co144Gd156 or PCC&#8208;300CG). For the first family M could be either nickel or cobalt, and RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd; while the latter features the highest nuclearity of transition&#8208;rare earth metal clusters. Characterized by their cube&#8208;like, hollow structures, these clusters exhibit the ability to absorb N2 and CO2. Besides, these clusters can be dissolved in both aqueous and acetonitrile/methanol solutions, and capable of acting as homogeneous catalysts for converting CO2 to CO under visible light. The gadolinium analogues of these clusters all show turnover numbers over 10000 and turnover frequencies over 1&#8197;s&#8722;1. In particular, the nickel based bimetallic cluster (PCC&#8208;216NG) demonstrates nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity for the reduction product, which may open a new direction for the design and development of PCCs based catalysts.

         <title>A ZnO&#8208;based Catalytic System for the Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system (ZnO(OVs)/Zn plate) has an internal electron source for the synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen in ambient air. Water forms a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface, accelerating the oxygen transfer from the ambient air to the catalyst surface and facilitating the separation and collection of the reaction product.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a wide range of applications as an eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable oxidant. However, the clean, efficient and convenient synthesis of this compound remains challenging. This work demonstrates a rationally designed electron&#8208;self&#8208;supplied catalytic system capable of generating H2O2 from water and atmospheric oxygen without extra energy input. This catalytic system is made of a ZnO coating containing oxygen vacancies and a Zn substrate. The ZnO catalyst layer obtains electrons from the Zn substrate to synthesize H2O2. The H2O2 concentration produced by this catalytic system is up to 17.9&#8197;mM without any secondary processing. This remarkably high concentration is attributed to the formation of a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface that promotes the oxygen reduction reaction by accelerating the transfer of oxygen from the ambient air to the catalyst surface. By integrating with atmospheric fog collection, this system can continuously collect H2O2 directly from the air.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Aqueous Electrolyte Induced Formation of Water&#8208;Poor Zn2+ Solvation Structures and Gradient Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;entropy aqueous electrolyte is developed by introducing multiple solutes and solvents. The well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated water molecules and free water while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase protective layer and a cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode, which can effectively mitigate the corrosion of the Zn anode and promote uniform deposition of Zn.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing Zn&#8208;metal anodes. However, a single solute or solvent additive is far from sufficient to meet the requirements for electrolyte cycling stability. Here, we report a new&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of equal molar amounts of Zn(OTf)2 and LiOTf, along with equal volumes of H2O, triethyl phosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide, which enhances electrolyte stability by increasing solvation entropy. Specifically, this well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated and free water molecules while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode surface, protecting the Zn anode from water&#8208;induced corrosion. Moreover, the cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode effectively suppresses the &#8220;tip effect&#8221;, enabling the uniform deposition of Zn. The synergistic effects of this mixed electrolyte effectively leverage the properties of individual additives, significantly extending the cycle life of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Consequently, the resulting Zn//Zn symmetric cell using this high&#8208;entropy electrolyte can operate over 8000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. To highlight, in a Zn//V2O5&#8901;H2O pouch cell, it retains 83.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 420 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such multifunctional high&#8208;entropy electrolyte design provides a meaningful reference for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Where Does the Proton Go? Structure and Dynamics of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Switching in Aminophosphine Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminophosphine chalcogenides are relevant in many organocatalytic concepts and are the focus of prebiotic studies. Spectroscopy (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), MD simulations, and DFT calculations provide unique insight into their proton&#8208;binding affinity. All conceivable hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes can be formed and controlled. Fundamental principles of self&#8208;organization, proton&#8208;hopping, and of the behavior at the lower concentration threshold are revealed.







Abstract
Aminophosphates are the focus of research on prebiotic phosphorylation chemistry. Their bifunctional nature also makes them a powerful class of organocatalysts. However, the structural chemistry and dynamics of proton&#8208;binding in phosphorylation and organocatalytic mechanisms are still not fully understood. Aminophosphine chalcogenides, preserving the central H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural motif, represent well&#8208;suited molecular models that mimic proton&#8208;binding, hydrogen&#8208;bond switching and supramolecular self&#8208;assembling behavior of catalytically and prebiotically relevant molecules. Through spectroscopic (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), molecular dynamics, and computational investigations, the dynamic proton switching capability of aminophosphate analogs was demonstrated. It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH2) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural units are protonated. In fact, all conceivable modes of hydrogen&#8208;bonding were identified, revealing substantial differences between the oxygen derivative and the heavier congeners. Using coordinating anions, supramolecular zigzag&#8208; and cube&#8208;shaped arrangements were found in the solid&#8208;state and in solution. After break&#8208;up of the cube structure, the sulfides and selenides no longer form stable interactions with HCl molecules. In the absence of coordinating anions, however, protonation of the chalcogen function is preferred. In contrast to the oxygen derivative, the heavier protonated congeners show dynamic intramolecular proton&#8208;hopping between the chalcogen and the amino function.

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Figure&#8208;Eight&#8208;Noded Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed condensation of Figure&#8208;eight units develops novel double&#8208;decker 2D covalent organic frameworks to create well&#8208;defined &#960; arrays and 1D micropores. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks are brilliant light emitters, convert &#960; columns into water oxidation and oxygen reduction centers, and produce H2O2 efficiently with water/salt water, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs, opening a novel way to framework and well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials.







Abstract
Figure&#8208;eight macrocycles represent a fascinating class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units characterized by unique aesthetics and non&#8208;contact molecular crossing at the center. Despite progress in synthesis over the past century, research into inorganic, organic, and polymeric figure&#8208;eight materials remains in its infancy. Here we report the first examples of figure&#8208;eight covalent organic frameworks by condensing figure&#8208;eight knots to create extended porous figure&#8208;eight &#960; architectures. A distinct feature is that polymerization interweaves figure&#8208;eight knots into double&#8208;decker layers, which upon supramolecular polymerization organize well&#8208;defined layer frameworks. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks exhibit a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV and emit bright orange florescence with benchmark quantum yields. Remarkably, the donor&#8208;acceptor figure&#8208;eight skeletons convert the figure&#8208;eight knots into reduction centers and the linkers into oxidation sites upon light irradiation, enable charge transport and accumulation through &#960; columns, while the built&#8208;in hydrophilic micropores allow rapid water and oxygen delivery via capillary effect. With these distinct features, the figure&#8208;eight frameworks function as a photocatalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide at high rate and efficiency with water/saltwater, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs. This work paves a way to a new class of molecular frameworks, underpinning the study of well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials to explore unprecedented structures and functions so far we untouched.

         <title>Unlocking Hexafluoroisopropanol as a Practical Anion&#8208;Binding Catalyst for Living Cationic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution unlocks a simple, versatile, robust, and sustainable anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy for living cationic polymerization, wherein commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to mediate dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, thereby delivering unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions.







Abstract
Living cationic polymerization (LCP) is a classical technique for precision polymer synthesis; however, due to the high sensitivity of cationic active species towards chain&#8208;transfer/termination events, it is notoriously difficult to control polymerization under mild conditions, which inhibits its progress in advanced materials engineering. Here, we unlock a practical anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy to address the historical dilemma in LCP. Our experimental and mechanistic studies demonstrate that commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to tame dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, in turn inducing distinctive polymerization kinetics behaviors that grant efficient chain propagation while minimizing competitive side reactions. This unique control mechanism delivers unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions, and provides easy access to high molecular weight polymers, block copolymers, and end&#8208;functionalized telechelic polymers. Also, the minimalistic structure of HFIP coupled with its convenient removal and recycle renders this approach easy to scale up, without concern for cost, sustainability and complicated work&#8208;up processes associated with previous systems. This study presents another universal and sustainable strategy for cationic macromolecular engineering, and will also stimulate further exploration of innovative non&#8208;covalent catalysis that enables more challenging living polymerization systems.

         <title>Tuning the Acid Hardness Nature of Cu Catalyst for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base theory, this work explores tuning the hardness properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts to enhance nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. By modifying Cu&#8208;based catalyst with BaO, we enhanced improved dynamics for protonation and desorption of key intermediates, achieving 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) in alkaline electrolyte presents a sustainable pathway for energy storage and green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, it remains challenging to obtain high activity and selectivity due to the limited protonation and/or desorption processes of key intermediates. Herein, we propose a strategy to regulate the acid hardness nature of Cu catalyst by introducing appropriate modifier. Using density functional theory calculations, we firstly identified that the BaO&#8208;modified Cu showed optimal Gibbs free energies for key NO3RR steps, including the protonation of *NO and the desorption of *NH3. Experimentally, the BaO&#8208;modified Cu catalyst exhibited 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 with a yield rate of 356.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. It could also maintain high activity across a wide range of applied potentials and nitrate substrate concentrations. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Ba species could modulate the local electronic states of Cu, enhance the electron transfer rate, and optimize the adsorption/protonation/desorption processes of the N&#8208;containing intermediates, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Photoacid Generators with Green/Red&#8208;light Responsiveness and Cooperative Functionality</title>

PBI&#8208;PAG undergoes a quantitative (&gt;99&#8201;%) photoreaction to generate acid and photosensitizer (CBI) upon green/red light (560&#8197;nm&#8208;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Beyond respective roles as catalyst and PDT agent, the released acid and CBI sensitizer could cooperate in tumor anti&#8208;metastasis and ablation, granting PBI&#8208;PAG as a powerful molecular tool in inter&#8208;disciplinary applications.







Abstract
Photoacid generators (PAGs) are invaluable molecular tools that exhibited tremendous potential in emerging interdisciplinary researches of life&#8208;science, nanotechnology and smart materials. However, current PAGs are primarily mono&#8208;functional in terms of acid generation and rely on UV/deep&#8208;blue light excitation, posing a fundamental hurdle to their broader adoption. Developing cooperatively functioned PAGs with long&#8208;wavelength light responsiveness presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of suitable molecular scaffolds. Here, we introduce a newly&#8208;developed perylene bisimides PAG motif (PBI&#8208;PAG) that integrates desired multi&#8208;functionality and visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;reactivity. Taking advantages of characteristic opto&#8208;electronic properties of PBI scaffold, PBI&#8208;PAGs are capable of quantitative releasing (&gt;99&#8201;%) a palette of acids upon green/red light (560&#8211;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Concurrently, a photo&#8208;generated counterpart is functioned as a photo&#8208;sensitizer that could perform cooperatively with acid as an anti&#8208;metastasis cancer therapy agent. These two processes constitute the first example of a cooperatively functioned PAG operated at substrate&#8208;adaptive wavelengths.

         <title>Gradient Design with Low&#8208;Tortuosity Overcoming Kinetic Limitations in High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

A multilayer coating with magnetic field alignment is designed to optimize ion transport and concentration gradients in solid&#8208;state cathodes, enhancing electrochemical kinetics and increasing energy/power densities, thereby overcoming a key challenge in solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.







Abstract
The extensive commercialization of practical solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) necessitates the development of high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state cathodes with fast charging capability. However, electrochemical kinetics are severely delayed in thick cathodes due to tortuous ion transport pathways and slow solid&#8208;solid ion diffusion, which limit the achievable capacity of SSBs at high current densities. In this work, we propose a conductivity gradient cathode with low&#8208;tortuosity to enable facile ion transport and counterbalance ion concentration gradient, thereby overcoming the kinetic limitations and achieving fast charging capabilities in thick cathodes. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes deliver a room&#8208;temperature (RT) capacities of 147 and 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C, respectively, and meanwhile achieve a RT areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3&#8197;C, enabling SSBs simultaneously high energy and power densities. The universality of this strategy is demonstrated in LiFePO4 cathodes, providing a novel solution for fast charging and large&#8208;scale application of high&#8208;loading SSBs.

         <title>Insights into the Electrolyte Hydrolysis and Its Impacts on the Interfacial Chemistry of a Li+&#8208;Intercalated Anode during High&#8208;Temperature Calendar Aging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry was employed for decoupling the hydrolysis reaction mechanism of two conventional Li salts in the bulk of electrolyte and at the Li+&#8208;intercalated anode surface during high&#8208;temperature storage. Results showed that the hydrolysis products effectively passivated the anode surface and contributed to improved interfacial stability against high&#8208;temperature calendar aging.







Abstract
Calendar aging occurring during high&#8208;temperature storage has long plagued practical realization of long&#8208;life, high&#8208;safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Generally, the aging process is ascribed to the hydrolysis reaction of fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte salt that generates hydrofluoric acid and chemically corrodes the anode surface. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism about electrolyte degradation, HF generation and surface corrosion remains concealed for various electrolytes. In this work, we employed in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy to resolve the chemical evolution during high&#8208;temperature calendar aging in the bulk of the electrolyte and at the anode/electrolyte interface. Two conventional salts, LiPF6 and Li bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), were employed for comparison. We identify that the high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis of LiPF6 preferentially occurs when the anion aggregates ([PF6+LiPF6]&#8722;) are attacked by trace H2O. HPO2F2, HF and LiF are generated and assist formation of an inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), improving anode stability against parasitic reactions. The LiFSI&#8208;based electrolyte does not involve hydrolysis, which facilities the formation of an organics&#8208;rich SEI. Nevertheless, the SEI does not passivate the anode surface and could induce severe corrosions via electron tunneling at a high temperature. Our work offers original insights into rational design of electrolyte and interface for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life LIBs.

         <title>Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acids Synergy in Photocatalytic Aerobic Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites were integrated into TiO2, which can supply coordinatively unsaturated sites to adsorb molecular oxygen and establish hydrogen bond with the OH groups of alcohols. The synergy of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites achieves efficient photocatalytic organic transformations.







Abstract
Photocatalytic chemical transformations for green organic synthesis has attracted much interest. However, their development is greatly hampered by the lack of sufficient reactive sites on the photocatalyst surface for the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of well&#8208;defined Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites coexisting on the surface of TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2) creates abundant active adsorption sites for photoredox reactions. The electron&#8208;deficient Lewis acid sites supply coordinatively unsaturated surface sites to adsorb molecular oxygen, and the Br&#248;nsted acid sites are liable to donate protons to form hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of alcohols like benzyl alcohol (BA). These coexistent acid sites result in a strong synergistic effect in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of BA. For example, the conversion of BA to benzaldehyde was found to be 88.6&#8201;%, being much higher than those of pristine TiO2 (14.7&#8201;%), N&#8208;doped TiO2 (N&#8208;TiO2, 24.6&#8201;%), sulfated TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/ TiO2, 35.4&#8201;%), and even their sum. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was determined to be 58.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and 12.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm over SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2. This strategy to create effective synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids on the catalyst surfaces enables us to apply it to other semiconducting photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Clone&#8208;Resolved Chemical Depletion of T cells via Cellular Proximity Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical strategy of depleting T cells utilizes chemically engineered dendritic cell (DC) &#8208;derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy targeted T cell clones in close proximity. This strategy enables selective elimination of pathogenic T cell clones without impairing normal T cells, which might serve as a new antigen&#8208;specific approach for blunting autoimmune inflammations.







Abstract
T cells play a pivotal role in the development of autoimmune diseases. To mitigate autoimmune inflammation without inducing global immunosuppression, it is crucial to selectively eliminate autoreactive T cell clones while preserving the normal T cell repertoire. In this study, we applied cellular proximity chemistry to develop a T&#8208;cell depletion method with clonal precision. Using engineered dendritic cells (DCs) with surface&#8208;bound photosensitizers, we generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at immune synapses, leading to the targeted death of antigen&#8208;specific T cells in close proximity. This process induces lipid oxidation in T cell membranes, triggering ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. The method enables the selective elimination of specific T cell clones without affecting others, in which the clonal resolution was demonstrated by TCR sequencing. Finally, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in a type 1 diabetes model by selectively depleting the pathogenic 8.3 T cell clone, thereby protecting islet &#946; cells and preserving overall T cell function. This strategy offers a promising avenue for immunosuppressive therapy that targets pathogenic T cells while maintaining overall immune integrity.

         <title>Forward&#8208; and Retro&#8208;Vapofluorochromism of Sponge&#8208;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials with a wide range of multicolor properties have attracted increasing attention due to their wide applications. We here report a unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior of sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals for multicolor switching through reversible amine vapor uptake and &#8220;squeeze&#8221; &#8211; induced solid&#8208;state intramolecular and intermolecular motion.







Abstract
Achieving dynamic multicolor emission through solid&#8208;state molecular motion is of significant importance for advancing applications in organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. Herein, we report macrocycle crystals with unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior, which is realized by reversible amine vapor uptake and amine&#8208;&#8220;squeeze&#8221; induced guest release. The forward&#8208;vapofluorochromism occurs when aliphatic amines penetrate guest&#8208;free macrocycle crystals to form host&#8208;guest complex crystals. These fluorescent properties can be reversibly toggled by exposing the amine&#8208;loaded crystals to another amine vapor through competitive guest replacement inside the crystals. Notably, retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism is achieved by exposing amine&#8208;loaded crystals to &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (MBA). Mechanistic studies show that MBA molecules do not penetrate the crystals, but rather &#8220;squeeze&#8221; the crystals to release loaded amines, driving the amine&#8208;loaded crystals back to the guest&#8208;free phase. The demonstrated forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism has already been successfully integrated into a highly secure five&#8208;layer information encryption system.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Modified Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Towards Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs with a CIEy Value of 0.74</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;narrow green multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been developed by synergistic cyano&#8208;decoration and a &#960;&#8208;extension strategy. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver an exceptional green color purity that approaches the BT.2020 standard, as well as high external quantum efficiencies exceeding 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The development of pure&#8208;green organic emitters with ideal emission peaks and ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report two new green emitters, CNBN and MCNBN, which achieve extremely narrow FWHMs by synergistic rigid &#960;&#8208;extension and cyano&#8208;substitution of a sky&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core. The introduction of cyano groups induces red&#8208;shifts in the emission to the green region and dramatically minimizes the FWHMs. In toluene solution, CNBN and MCNBN exhibit narrowband emission with a maximum at 501&#8197;nm and 510&#8197;nm with ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs of 14&#8197;nm/0.066&#8197;eV and 15&#8197;nm/0.071&#8197;eV, respectively. Given the near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and almost 100&#8201;% horizontal dipole orientation, the electroluminescent (EL) devices based on CNBN and MCNBN deliver external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 30&#8201;% with FWHMs of 16&#8197;nm/0.072&#8197;eV and 17&#8197;nm/0.080&#8197;eV, respectively. Notably, the MCNBN&#8208;based device achieves pure&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 517&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.17, 0.74), closely aligning with the BT.2020 green standard.

         <title>Integrated Two&#8208;in&#8208;one Strategy for Efficient Neutral Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Phosphorous Doping in 2D Mesoporous Carbon Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for efficient electrocatalytic H2O2 production in neutral media by incorporation P dopant in the carbon framework. The incorporation of P not only helps to modify the microenvironment of the catalyst, but also further adjusts the coordination environment and electronic structure of the In single atom. This optimization enhances the adsorption of *OOH, thereby accelerating the efficient formation of H2O2.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate a two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for efficient neutral electrosynthesis of H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieved by synergistically fine&#8208;modulating both the local microenvironment and electronic structure of indium (In) single atom (SA) sites. Through a series of finite elemental simulations and experimental analysis, we highlight the significant impact of phosphorous (P) doping on an optimized 2D mesoporous carbon carrier, which fosters a favorable microenvironment by improving the mass transfer and O2 enrichment, subsequently leading to an increased local pH levels. Consequently, an outstanding 2e&#8722; ORR performance is observed in neutral electrolytes, achieving over 95&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 across a broad voltage range of 0.1 to 0.5&#8197;V vs RHE. In a flow cell, the production rate of H2O2 exceeds 22.54&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 while maintaining high stability at industrial&#8208;level current densities. These results are comparable to, if not better than, those achieved under alkaline conditions. Further analysis, both experimental and theoretical, indicates that the P dopant occupies the second coordination sphere of the In SA, which shows optimized OOH* binding strength for an enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic.

         <title>Flow Electroreductive Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation of Alkenes Using gem&#8208;Dichloroalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient continuous&#8208;flow electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins using commercial gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes. The reaction is tolerant to oxygen and moisture while displaying a broad functional group compatibility. This methodology enables gram&#8208;scale cyclopropanation and is compatible with a wide range of alkenes. Mechanistic studies suggests that a nickel carbene is electro&#8208;generated to afford the cyclopropane ring.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are valuable motifs in organic synthesis, widely featured in pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical methodology for the cyclopropanation of alkenes, leveraging a nickel&#8208;catalyzed process in continuous&#8208;flow. The developed protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor alkenes with high functional group tolerance. Beyond dichloromethane as a feedstock methylene source, the methodology enables the synthesis of methylated, deuterated, and chloro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. Mechanistic investigations suggest the electro&#8208;generation of a nickel carbene as key intermediate. Notably, the reaction operates under ambient conditions, tolerates air and moisture, and achieves scalability through continuous&#8208;flow technology, offering a straightforward route to multi&#8208;gram quantities with enhanced throughput.

         <title>The First Kleinman&#8208;type Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Circular Dichroism On/Off Switchable Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics show a ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from the chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 to chiral&#8208;nonpolar 422, which enables the notable switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response from SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) to inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states. Such an on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD effect is unprecedented.







Abstract
Chiral ferroelectrics have recently received considerable interest due to their unique chiroptical properties. They can adopt Kleinman symmetry second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#8208;active chiral&#8208;polar point groups in the ferroelectric phase while Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive chiral&#8208;nonpolar point groups in the paraelectric phase, providing a great opportunity to realize on/off switching of SHG circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. However, the SHG&#8208;CD effect was rarely explored in chiral ferroelectrics, and the on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD has never been reported. Herein, we report the first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics (R/S&#8208;CS)Ca(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) (CS=camphor&#8208;10&#8208;sulfonic acid), which undergo a 422F2 type ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;active point group 2 to Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive point group 422. Notably, they exhibit obvious SHG&#8208;CD responses with an anisotropy factor of up to 0.31. More importantly, the SHG&#8208;CD response can be switched between SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) and inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states during the ferroelectric phase transition, which is unprecedented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of Kleinman&#8208;type SHG&#8208;CD on/off switchable ferroelectric. Our findings open up a new way to switch SHG&#8208;CD response based on chiral ferroelectrics, which would greatly inspire the further exploration of switchable SHG&#8208;CD effects in chiral ferroelectrics.

         <title>Chemically Patterning Lithiophilic Interphase to Harmonize Spatial Electrons and Thermal Catalysis Dynamics for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of elaborated chemically patterning to decorate Cu foil was proposed to harmonize spatial Li+ and facilitate thermal catalysis dynamics for stable and safe lithium metal batteries. The compact electrode with lithiophilic array regulated Li plating/stripping behavior, mitigating Li dendrite formation. Moreover, the composite electrode can suppress smoke and reduce toxicity during the battery thermal runaway process, making a significant improvement for next&#8208;generation safe lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries have garnered significant attention as promising energy storage solutions. However, their performance is often compromised by the risks associated with highly active metallic lithium, unrestricted electrode expansion, and excessive dendrites growth. Here we introduce an advanced lithiophilic anode substrate designed by chemically patterning technology for multiple security enhancements. The innovative lithiophilic array harmonizes spatial Li+ to prepare compact and reversible electrodes. The composite electrodes feature an enhanced C&#8722;F component in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, which protects the deposited lithium metal from unwanted side reactions, thereby stabilizing electrochemical cycling. Notably, the thermal safety can be revealed through the substrate&#8216;s excellent catalytic ability to convert smoke and toxic gases during extreme thermal runaway. This work demonstrates a novel approach to integrating battery cycling stability with thermal safety, paving the way for more reliable and secure energy storage systems.

         <title>Rigidly Locked Pyrene Excimers in Planar Chiral Pyrenophanes for Intense and Stable Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. These compounds reveal intense and stable circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), thus making them attractive platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications, such as chiral sensing.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platforms with excellent performances in both circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), a new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. Attributed to densely packed pyrene excimers, the resultant pyrenophanes revealed tunable bridge&#8208;dependent emission behaviors, as investigated by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. More importantly, all these planar chiral pyrenophanes display strong CP&#8208;PL with large dissymmetry factor (gPL) values up to 0.034, and such excellent performances remain stable in a wide range of solvents, temperatures, and concentrations. Attractively, the highest gECL values up to 0.014 reported so far has been achieved for the CP&#8208;ECL emissions of the chiral pyrenophanes. Attributed to their unique structural features and outstanding CPL performances, these novel pyrenophanes could serve as promising platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications such as chiral sensing.

         <title>Towards Solid&#8208;State Batteries Using a Calcium Hydridoborate Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the discovery of a fast solid&#8208;state Ca&#8208;ionic conductor based on di(methylamine) calcium tetrahydridoborate. The new compound Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3 crystallizes in a relatively open and flexible layered structure, which allows for fast Ca&#8208;ion migration in the solid state. The calcium plating/stripping behavior is investigated in cell configurations of Ca|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|M (M=Pt or Mo) and CaxSn|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|Sn.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries created from abundant elements, such as calcium, may pave the way for cheaper and safer electrical energy storage. Here we report a new type of solid calcium hydridoborate electrolyte, Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3, with a high ionic conductivity of &#963;(Ca2+) ~10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at T=70&#8201;&#176;C, which is assigned to a relatively open and flexible structure with apolar moieties and weak dihydrogen bonds that facilitate migration of Ca2+ ions in the solid state. The compound display a low electronic conductivity, providing an ionic transport number close to unity (tion=0.9916). Calcium plating is observed for a Ca|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|Pt electrochemical cell and the electrodes are investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) that reveal a rugged Ca anode surface owing to the stripping process and the presence of Ca&#8208;containing domains on the Pt working electrode from the plating process.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Synthesis of a Polymer in Two Distinct Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing topologically different polymers from single monomer via traditional solution&#8208;state synthesis is impossible. Two different polymorphs underwent spontaneous topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization and resulted into topologically distinct polymers having 1,4&#8208;disubstituded triazole in the backbone. Furthermore, upon heating at high temperature, both polymorphs exhibited distinct thermoresponses and mechanical properties accompanied by topochemical polymerization.







Abstract
A squaramide&#8208;based monomer, designed for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization, crystallizes as two polymorphs, M1 and M2, both having crystal packing suitable for topochemical polymerization. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding between squaramide units bias the molecular organization in both the polymorphs. 3D packing of H&#8208;bonded stacks of monomer lead to juxtaposition of azide and alkyne units of adjacent molecules in a transition&#8208;state&#8208;like arrangement for their regiospecific cycloaddition reaction. The monomers are arranged as supramolecular sheets and supramolecular helices in polymorph M1 and M2 respectively. Both the polymorphs undergo slow and spontaneous regiospecific TAAC polymerization at room temperature, but react quickly at higher temperatures, resulting in 1,4&#8208;traizolyl&#8208;linked polymer, with distinct mechanical responses. Upon heating, single crystals of polymorph M1 show expansion followed by contraction without any permanent dimensional change, whereas crystals of polymorph M2 undergo splitting. At moderate temperatures, both the polymorphs undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) polymerization, resulting in two polymer&#8208;polymorphs with distinct topologies that can be studied at atomic resolution by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The polymorph M1 reacts to polymer P1 with &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like topology, and polymorph M2 reacts to polymer P2 having polymer chains of helical conformation. Nanoindentation experiments with crystals of these polymers revealed their distinct mechanical properties.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalyzed Alkylation of Phosphonites by Direct Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent oxidation sensitivity of P(III) reagents has long hindered their application in oxidative coupling. However, the synergy of light and electricity enables a general, modular approach to the synthesis of functionalized alkylphosphonites from carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions using P(III) compounds as limiting reagents. This strategy is applicable to the alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleoside&#8208;derived phosphonites.







Abstract
A photoelectrocatalytic method is presented that achieves direct decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P coupling, providing a modular route to alkylphosphinates and alkylphosphonates from readily available carboxylic acids. The success of this reaction hinges on the synergistic combination of electrochemical anodic oxidation and photocatalytic ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) decarboxylation. By employing P(III) reagents as limiting reagents, our approach enables efficient alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleosides and complex molecules derived phosphonites, which were challenging to access by existing methods. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the critical roles of Fe catalysts and additives, offering valuable insights into the reaction pathway and laying the foundation for future advancements in photoelectrocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Perylene Diimide Macrocycle Chiroptical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle has been prepared in which point chiral imide groups yield a discrete helical dimer, to mimic a helical supramolecular assembly. The macrocycle exhibits three&#8208;way switching of its chiroptical properties in solution (+/&#8722;/off). This behaviour can be controlled by various stimuli, including the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and identifies important structure&#8208;property relationships for chiral materials.







Abstract
Helical assemblies of organic dyes are ubiquitous chiral organic materials, with valuable properties including chiroptical switching due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report a novel chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle, which acts as a discrete molecular model for a chiral supramolecular assembly. Point chirality is installed through amino acid&#8208;derived imide groups which, upon macrocyclization, is translated into helical chirality in the perylene diimide dimer. In solution, the macrocycle's chiroptical properties are switchable, with both the sign (+/&#8722;) and amplitude (on/off) of the signal tuned using solvent and molecular recognition stimuli respectively. The chiral structure&#8211;property relationships identified from this macrocycle are important for the design of high fidelity supramolecular chiroptical switches.

         <title>Realizing a 3&#8197;C Fast&#8208;Charging Practical Sodium Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus&#8208;sulfur synergistic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase has been constructed on the surface of hard carbon anode to reduce the energy barrier of both Na+ desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, a 126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Ah&#8208;level practical sodium pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C fast charging has been achieved. Further, a power&#8208;type pouch cell with a record high charging C&#8208;rate up to 50&#8197;C has also been fabricated.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), endowed with relatively small Stokes radius and low desolvation energy of Na+, are reckoned as a promising candidate for fast&#8208;charging endeavors. However, the C&#8208;rate charging capability of practical energy&#8208;dense sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells is currently limited to &#8804;1&#8197;C, due to the high propensity for detrimental metallic Na plating on the hard carbon (HC) anode at elevated rates. Here, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level sodium&#8208;ion pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging is successfully developed via phosphorus (P)&#8208;sulfur (S) interphase chemistry. By rational electrolyte regulation, desired P&#8722;S constituents, namely, Na3PO4 and Na2SO4, are generated in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with favorable Na+ interface kinetics. Specifically, Na+ desolvation energy barrier has been greatly lowered by the weak ion&#8208;solvent coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane on Na3PO4 interphase, while Na2SO4 expedites charge carrier mobility due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity. Consequently, an energy&#8208;dense (126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) O3&#8208;Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||HC pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging (100&#8201;% state of charge) without Na plating can be achieved, with a great capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles. Further, the assembled power&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)3||HC pouch cell displays an impressive fast&#8208;charging capability of 50&#8197;C, which surpasses that of previously reported high&#8208;power SIBs. This work serves as an enlightenment for developing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

     alt="Realizing a 3&#8197;C Fast-Charging Practical Sodium Pouch Cell"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phosphorus-sulfur synergistic solid-electrolyte interphase has been constructed on the surface of hard carbon anode to reduce the energy barrier of both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, a 126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; Ah-level practical sodium pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C fast charging has been achieved. Further, a power-type pouch cell with a record high charging C-rate up to 50&#8197;C has also been fabricated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), endowed with relatively small Stokes radius and low desolvation energy of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, are reckoned as a promising candidate for fast-charging endeavors. However, the C-rate charging capability of practical energy-dense sodium-ion pouch cells is currently limited to &#8804;1&#8197;C, due to the high propensity for detrimental metallic Na plating on the hard carbon (HC) anode at elevated rates. Here, an ampere-hour-level sodium-ion pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging is successfully developed via phosphorus (P)-sulfur (S) interphase chemistry. By rational electrolyte regulation, desired P&#8722;S constituents, namely, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are generated in the solid-electrolyte interphase with favorable Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interface kinetics. Specifically, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation energy barrier has been greatly lowered by the weak ion-solvent coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane on Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; interphase, while Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; expedites charge carrier mobility due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity. Consequently, an energy-dense (126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) O3-Na(Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||HC pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging (100&#8201;% state of charge) without Na plating can be achieved, with a great capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles. Further, the assembled power-type Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||HC pouch cell displays an impressive fast-charging capability of 50&#8197;C, which surpasses that of previously reported high-power SIBs.

         <title>Oligomerized Electron Acceptors with Alkynyl Linkages to Suppress Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>

A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling, achieving precise morphology control, reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, and high efficiencies up to 19.52% in ternary solar cells.







Abstract
A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling. The alkynyl linkages can enhance molecular planarity and aggregation, suppress electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and reduce non&#8208;radiative losses. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved an efficiency of 17.90%, with a non&#8208;radiative loss of 0.185 eV, while ternary OSCs reached a remarkable efficiency of 19.52%. Oligomerized electron acceptors, featuring molecular weights akin to polymers and well&#8208;defined chemical structures, have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their consistent batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and improved thermal stability. In this study, we developed a series of oligomerized electron acceptors incorporating alkynyl linkages via an efficient Sonogashira coupling reaction between alkyne&#8208;substituted Y&#8208;type precursors and multi&#8208;substituted iodobenzenes. This method produced monomeric (S&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), dimeric (D&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), and trimeric (T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF) configurations, enabling systematic control over molecular size and substituent arms. The alkynyl linkages, characterized by high bond strength and planar geometry, enhanced molecular planarity and aggregation in films, thus facilitating precise control over morphology and phase separation in the photoactive layers. Notably, the inclusion of these linkages effectively suppressed electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced non&#8208;radiative energy losses and elevated photocarrier lifetime. OSCs based on PM6:T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.90%, a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of 0.185&#8197;eV, and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.943&#8197;V. Furthermore, integrating T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF into the D18:N3 blend yielded an exceptional PCE of 19.52%. These results underscore the potential of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized acceptors in advancing highly efficient and stable OSCs, offering a viable pathway for reducing electron&#8208;phonon coupling and enhancing device performance.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Engineered Hydrophilic Perovskite Enabling Surface Potential&#8208;Driven Anions Exchange for Multicolor Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometric preorganization induced by C=C bonds in unsaturated alkylamines and the &#8220;bridge&#8221; effect of haloalkanoic acids are harnessed to promote the SN2 reaction and design zwitterionic ligands, enabling CsPbBr3 NCs with hydrophilicity and a 100&#8201;% PLQY. Based on the positive surface potential&#8208;driven fast anion exchange (FAE) reaction, AgI NPs are developed as latent anion exchangers, realizing multicolor biosensing with H2S as an example.







Abstract
The difficulty in designing zwitterionic ligands impedes the water&#8208;dispersed CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and their application as fast anion exchange (FAE) probes in biosensing. This study proposes a design paradigm for zwitterionic ligands predicated upon revealing the mechanism of the SN2 reaction between unsaturated alkylamines (Cn&#8242;) and haloalkanoic acids (HAAs). Among them, the C=C bond can enhance the nucleophilicity of Cn&#8242; and promote the electrostatic adsorption of HAAs onto Cn&#8242;, i.e., the geometric preorganization process, thereby initiating the SN2 reaction. Moreover, an appropriate &#8220;bridge&#8221; length enables HAAs to balance the geometric preorganization process and the Sigma hole intensity of the C&#8722;Br bond. Zwitterionic ligands derived from oleylamine (C18&#8242;) and 5&#8208;bromovaleric acid (5&#8208;BVA) endow CsPbBr3 NCs with water dispersibility, an almost 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced surface potential, facilitating the capture of halide ions and driving the FAE reaction. Using AgI nanoparticles (NPs) as latent anion exchangers, a third FAE strategy is presented for multicolor biosensing. Such a robust biosensing strategy can generate wavelength shift and chromatic difference for biological target molecules, exemplified by H2S, and is ultimately applicable to multicolor assay in biological, environmental and food samples, demonstrating the immense potential of perovskite&#8208;based FAE probes in biosensing.

         <title>Innovative asymmetric CoSA&#8208;N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx catalysis: unleashing superoxide radicals for rapid self&#8208;coupling removal of phenolic pollutant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy is proposed to create an asymmetrical Co&#8208;N2O3 microenvironment onto Ti3C2Tx. It shows excellent peroxymonosulfate activation capability for the formation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;) and the subsequently completed removal of phenolic pollutants. An &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation, is proposed for phenolic removal in water.







Abstract
The polymerization pathway of contaminants rivals the traditional mineralization pathway in water purification technologies. However, designing suitable oxidative environments to steer contaminants toward polymerization remains challenging. This study introduces a nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy to create an asymmetrical microenvironment for Co atoms on Ti3C2Tx MXenes, resulting in a novel Co&#8208;N2O3 microcellular structure that efficiently activates peroxymonosulfate. This unique activation capability led to the complete removal of various phenolic pollutants within 3&#8197;min, outperforming the representative Co single&#8208;atom catalysts reported in the past three years. Identifying and recognizing reactive oxygen species highlight the crucial role of &#8901;O2&#8722;. The efficient pollutant removal occurs through a &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich pollutants transfer more electrons to the catalyst surface, inducing the reduction of dissolved oxygen to &#8901;O2&#8722; in the Co&#8208;N2O3 microregion. In a practical continuous flow&#8208;through application, the system achieved 100&#8201;% acetaminophen removal efficiency in 6.5&#8197;h, with a hydraulic retention time of just 0.98&#8197;s. This study provides new insights into the previously underappreciated role of &#8901;O2&#8722; in pollutant purification, offering a simple strategy for advancing aggregation removal technology in the field of wastewater treatment.

         <title>Soluble Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Lithiophilic Modulator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two new COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile solution processing technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries, which can be utilized as artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase to protect lithium metal anode. Highly improved cycling performance of 5000&#8197;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500 cycles for LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as the potential alternative of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, severe instability and safety problems caused by the dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions have hindered the commercialization of LMBs. To solve them, in this contribution, a design strategy of soluble lithiophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is proposed. By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long&#8208;term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU&#8208;29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU&#8208;29@Li||LiFePO4 full cell. This work could provide a universal design strategy for soluble COFs and enlighten their application in diverse scenarios, especially energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanobiohybrids for High&#8208;Performance Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis via Multi&#8208;Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

We developed an innovative nanobiohybrid design strategy using eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn) through multi&#8208;interface engineering. The resulting Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b)&#8208;EGaIn nanobiohybrids enabled high&#8208;performance solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis by enhancing proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms. This study paves the way for sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Nanobiohybrids for solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis present a promising solution to the global energy crisis. However, conventional semiconductor&#8208;based nanobiohybrids face challenges such as limited tunability and poor biocompatibility, leading to undesirable spontaneous electron and proton transfer that compromise their structural stability and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we introduced eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn), featuring a self&#8208;limiting surface oxide layer surrounding the liquid metal core after sonication, integrated with Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The well&#8208;designed M. b&#8211;EGaIn nanobiohybrids exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum CH4 yield of 455.64&#177;15.99&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1, long&#8208;term stability across four successive 7&#8208;day cycles, and remarkable CH4 selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. These improvements stem from enhanced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms at the core&#8211;shell interface, further facilitated by the elevated expression of hydrogenases at the abiotic&#8211;biotic interface. This study provides an insightful concept for nanobiohybrid design through multi&#8208;interface engineering, advancing sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation by Synergistic Incorporation of Pure Silica Silicalite&#8208;1 Zeolite and CeO2 into Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy to active Cu centers by synergistically incorporating S1 and CeO2 into the catalytic matrix. S1 stabilizes small&#8208;sized CeO2 and thus enhances the synergistic interaction between Cu and CeO2. This promotes the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and Cu+ sites at the interface, achieving a simultaneous increase in selectivity and activity.







Abstract
Chemical conversion of CO2 is providing an opportunity to mitigate the global warming induced by the overconsumption of fossil fuel. Cu has been regarded as one of the most powerful contenders in catalyzing CO2 conversion, yet the precise manipulation of its surface state and the nearby chemical environment continues to pose a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst by utilizing CeO2 and pure silicon zeolite (S1) to co&#8208;activate Cu species. In CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (CTM) conversion, the space&#8208;time yield of methanol (STYMeOH) of the obtained CuCe/S1 catalysts reaches 87.23&#8197;g&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents a fivefold increase compared to that of the Cu/CeO2 catalysts. The following mechanistic investigations reveal that S1 serves as a pivotal stabilizer for the small&#8208;sized CeO2 particles, thereby significantly enhancing the synergistic interaction between Cu species and CeO2. The crafted interaface possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and a high content of Cu+, significantly enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and inhibiting the formation of CO. Our discovery presents a promising new direction for catalyst upgrading and performance enhancement for CTM processes in the foreseeable future.

         <title>Multiple Protophilic Redox&#8208;Active Sites in Reticular Organic Skeletons for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

Intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer expose consecutive electron delocalization route to fully access build&#8208;in ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic carbonyls for superior proton storage. A 5 e&#8722; high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong life (60,000&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Protons (H+) with the smallest size and fastest redox kinetics are regarded as competitive charge carriers in the booming Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Developing new H+&#8208;storage organic cathode materials with multiple ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic sites and super electron delocalization routes to propel superior ZOBs is crucial but still challenging. Here we design multiple protophilic redox&#8208;active reticular organic skeletons (ROSs) for activating better proton storage, triggered by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer. ROSs expose reticular electron delocalization geometries to fully access build&#8208;in protophilic carbonyl sites and promote ultrarapid H+ migration with an ultralow activation energy (0.13 vs. 0.29&#8197;eV of Zn2+ ions), thus delivering high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, the extended interconnected reticular structures strengthen the anti&#8208;dissolution of ROSs in aqueous electrolytes, affording long&#8208;lasting proton&#8208;storage activity in ZOBs to a superior level (60,000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Systematic studies identify the source of excellent charge storage as high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled five&#8208;electron redox process of carbonyl motifs in superstable ROSs. These findings can be of importance for evoking superior proton activity in multiple redox organics to build advanced Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Intermolecular H-bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer expose consecutive electron delocalization route to fully access build-in ultralow-energy-barrier protophilic carbonyls for superior proton storage. A 5 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; high-kinetics H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled mechanism gives the Zn-organic battery high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), large-current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and ultralong life (60,000&#8197;cycles).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) with the smallest size and fastest redox kinetics are regarded as competitive charge carriers in the booming Zn-organic batteries (ZOBs). Developing new H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-storage organic cathode materials with multiple ultralow-energy-barrier protophilic sites and super electron delocalization routes to propel superior ZOBs is crucial but still challenging. Here we design multiple protophilic redox-active reticular organic skeletons (ROSs) for activating better proton storage, triggered by intermolecular H-bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer. ROSs expose reticular electron delocalization geometries to fully access build-in protophilic carbonyl sites and promote ultrarapid H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration with an ultralow activation energy (0.13 vs. 0.29&#8197;eV of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions), thus delivering high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, the extended interconnected reticular structures strengthen the anti-dissolution of ROSs in aqueous electrolytes, affording long-lasting proton-storage activity in ZOBs to a superior level (60,000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Systematic studies identify the source of excellent charge storage as high-kinetics H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled five-electron redox process of carbonyl motifs in superstable ROSs. These findings can be of importance for evoking superior proton activity in multiple redox organics to build advanced Zn-organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prescribing DNA Origami Barrel&#8208;Directed Subtractive Patterning of Nanoparticles for Crystalline Superstructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using DNA origami barrels, we demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy to create tunable regiospecific patches on gold nanospheres. This enables the assembly of multidimensional superstructures, such as a graphane&#8208;like bilayered lattice, and provides a geometrical model for reverse engineering assembly symmetries. This approach advances nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties for photonic and electronic applications.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range ordered lattices formed by the directed arrangement of colloidal particles hold significant promise for applications such as photonic crystals, plasmonic metamaterials, and semiconductor electronics. Harnessing regioselective interactions through DNA&#8208;mediated assembly is a promising approach to advancing colloidal assembly. Despite efforts to engineer microscale patchy particles using sequence&#8208;specific binding properties of DNA, the control of patch formation on nanoscale isotropic spherical nanoparticles remains challenging. We demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy using barrel&#8208;shaped DNA origami (DNA barrel) to selectively block surfaces of DNA&#8208;coated gold nanospheres and create regiospecific patches. By designing binding positions and geometric parameters of DNA barrels, we can achieve controlled accessibility to nanosphere surfaces, forming patchy nanoparticles with tunable patch numbers and sizes. This strategy enables the construction of multidimensional superstructures with well&#8208;defined stereo relationships, represented by an unprecedented graphane&#8208;like bilayered superlattice. Furthermore, we developed a geometrical model that accounts for anisotropic particle bonding and steric hindrance, elucidating the relationship between architectural outcomes and the structural parameters of DNA&#8208;barrel&#8208;directed patchy nanoparticles, and enabling reverse engineering designs of potential assembly symmetries. This approach opens new avenues for generating nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties.

         <title>Synergizing Mg Single Atoms and Ru Nanoclusters for Boosting the Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube, was constructed to boost the catalytic performance of Ru catalysts. Mg atoms beneath Ru built an enhanced interfacial electronic metal&#8208;support interaction. Mg SACs adjacent to Ru aided H2O adsorption and activation. The synergistic Mg SACs and Ru nanoclusters promises an excellent catalytic performance for ammonia borane hydrolysis to produce H2.







Abstract
Development of efficient catalysts with high H2O molecule activation ability holds great importance for H2 production. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (BNC), was constructed as a high&#8208;performance support for ruthenium (Ru) nano&#8208;clusters. Dual functions of Mg SACs were discovered, where the Mg atoms beneath Ru catalysts built an interfacial electron polarization, inducing electron transfer from Ru to the Mg&#8208;BNC support. In addition, the oxyphilic Mg SACs adjacent to the Ru catalysts could actively participate in H2O adsorption. The combination of experimental characterization, reaction kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated a stronger intrinsic H2O activation capability at the positive Ru sites. Meanwhile, the synergistic Mg SACs jointly contribute to the acceleration of the sluggish H2O dissociation process in ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis reaction, resulting in exceptional hydrogen production activity and catalytic stability, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for utilizing alkaline earth metals as both the electronic promoter and the reactant activator, offering inspiration for the development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of a Dual Activatable DNAzyme Sensor in the Cavity of a DNA Nanocage for Logic&#8208;Gated Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spatially&#8208;controlled encapsulation of a dual&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor within the cavity of a DNA nanocage, a smart nanosensor is presented for correlated imaging of microRNA and metal ions. The cavity of nanocages is accessible to the dual targets, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of the DNAzyme probe, leading to improved bio&#8208;stability and imaging precision.







Abstract
Despite intense interest in design of DNAzyme sensors for molecular detection and imaging in living cells, their intracellular applications are still hampered by limited spatial control and poor bio&#8208;stability. Here we present controlled spatial confinement of a rationally designed, microRNA (miRNA)&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor probe (mDz) within the cavity of DNA nanocage, enabling efficient intracellular delivery with improved bio&#8208;stability for AND&#8208;gate molecular imaging. The mDz that possesses inactive DNAzyme activity is designed by the introduction of a blocking DNA strand, while miR&#8208;21 mediated strand displacement reaction allows for the formation of an intact DNAzyme structure for metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the DNA nanocage serves as a nanocarrier for intracellular delivery of mDz, in which the cavity is accessible to the dual targets for logic&#8208;gated molecular imaging, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of mDz by obstructing nuclease from entering the cavity of the DNA nanocage, resulting in enhanced bio&#8208;stability and improved molecular imaging precision. This strategy paves a way for the engineering of activatable DNA nanosensors with both self&#8208;delivery and self&#8208;protection capabilities to detect diverse intracellular targets.

         <title>Selective Interface Engineering with Large &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules Enables Durable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, bilirubin, is grafted onto multi&#8208;faceted Zn substrates to induce interfacial charge redistribution, elevate the Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhance H+ fixation at the Zn/electrolyte interface. This strategy effectively suppresses Zn dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions at the electrical double layer (EDL) of Zn/electrolyte interface are critical challenges limiting the performance of aqueous zinc ion batteries. Through density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules (e.g. bilirubin, biliverdin, lumirubin, and hemoglobin) onto Zn surface induces preferential adsorption on non&#8208;(002) facets, leading to interfacial charge redistribution, upshifted Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhanced H+ fixation capability. Among these, bilirubin (BR) is identified as the most effective, preferentially adsorbing onto non&#8208;Zn(002) facets to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction and promote Zn(002) planar growth during plating. This approach results in average Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 4000 cycles in Zn||BR&#8208;1@Cu cells and prolonged lifespan exceeding 1600&#8197;h in BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cells at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even under harsh conditions of 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cell maintains a lifespan of over 400&#8197;h. Furthermore, BR&#8208;1@Zn||MnO2 and BR&#8208;1@Zn||NVO full cells achieve 76.4&#8201;% and 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 800 and 1400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A g&#8722;1, respectively. This study underscores the importance of grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to allow selective Zn(002) exposure, Zn d&#8208;band center upshift, and EDL structure regulation, paving the way towards durable Zn anodes.

Among these, bilirubin (BR) is identified as the most effective, preferentially adsorbing onto non-Zn(002) facets to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction and promote Zn(002) planar growth during plating. This approach results in average Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 4000 cycles in Zn||BR-1@Cu cells and prolonged lifespan exceeding 1600&#8197;h in BR-1@Zn||BR-1@Zn cells at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Even under harsh conditions of 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, BR-1@Zn||BR-1@Zn cell maintains a lifespan of over 400&#8197;h. Furthermore, BR-1@Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and BR-1@Zn||NVO full cells achieve 76.4&#8201;% and 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 800 and 1400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This study underscores the importance of grafting large &#960;-conjugated molecules to allow selective Zn(002) exposure, Zn d-band center upshift, and EDL structure regulation, paving the way towards durable Zn anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Amino Acid Crystals with Enhanced Piezoelectric Performance for Biodegradable Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy was developed to enhance the piezoelectric responses of amino acid crystals by altering their molecular dipole moment, energy band gap and charge mobility. This method significantly improved the piezoelectric coefficients, reaching 50.36&#8197;pm/V. The resulting biodegradable and implantable force sensors exhibited high sensitivity and stability, making them ideal for long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring of physiological force signals.







Abstract
Amino acid crystals have emerged as promising piezoelectric materials for biodegradable and biocompatible sensors; however, their relatively low piezoelectric coefficients constrain practical applications. Here, we introduce a fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy to overcome this limitation and enhance the piezoelectric performance of amino acid crystals. Specifically, we substituted hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings of L&#8208;tryptophan, L&#8208;phenylalanine, and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine with fluorine, resulting in significantly elevated piezoelectric coefficients. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that fluorination strengthens polarization by modifying molecular dipole moments. Consequently, these fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals achieve piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.36&#8197;pm/V, surpassing those of other organic piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA), and gelatin. When integrated into flexible, biodegradable force sensors, the fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals exhibit a broad sensing range, high sensitivity, and stable in vivo operation over extended periods. This work establishes a versatile route for boosting piezoelectricity in biomaterials, thereby broadening their scope in biomedical applications.

         <title>Synergizing Interfacial Electric Field Regulation and In situ Robust Interphases for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries at High Currents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unstable cycling of lithium metal anode at high currents has hindered the viability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report a novel fluorocarbon additive, containing iodine, nitrogen, and fluorine elements, to regulate the interfacial electric field and promote the formation of mechanically robust and ionically conductive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, leading to remarkable electrochemical performances at high current conditions.







Abstract
Efficient cycling of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) under extremely high current conditions is critical for their practical applications. Here, we report a novel additive containing fluorine, nitrogen, and iodine elements (designated as FCS) to stabilize Li metal anodes in glyme&#8208;based ether electrolytes under high current conditions. Experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the cation of FCS selectively adsorbs on the electrode surface, optimizing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) structure and effectively regulating the surface electric field, thereby promoting homogeneous Li deposition. Simultaneously, the preferential decomposition of the FCS produces a mechanically robust and ionically conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, Li3N, and LiI components. Consequently, with the FCS additive, Li||Cu cells demonstrate a remarkably average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.12&#8201;% at an extremely high current of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 400 cycles. Additionally, Li||SPAN cells maintain a reversible capacity of 1126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. This work presents a new approach to simultaneously tune the Helmholtz plane and SEI using trace amounts of additive, paving the way for stable and efficient LMBs under high&#8208;current conditions.

The study reveals that the photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) via a direct LCCT pathway surpassed that of an indirect LCCT pathway. The direct LCCT mechanism is pivotal in maximizing photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.

Polyethylene waste undergoes hydrogenolysis using in situ hydrogen from methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR) over a Ru&#8211;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, achieving 85.1% conversion with 81.0% selectivity for liquid fuels and lubricants. Pt enhances APR&#8208;driven H2 generation, while Ru facilitates C&#9472;C cleavage in polyethylene. Isotope labeling confirms methanol&#8208;derived hydrogen utilization. This approach provides a sustainable alternative to fossil&#8208;derived hydrogen, as reported by Insoo Ro et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202420748).

C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently developed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle with donor&#8208; acceptor (D&#8211;A) units, which enhances photothermal conversion and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) synergistically combines photothermal and photodynamic therapies (PTT/PDT). Preclinical experiments have shown a strong immunotherapeutic effect by integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy. While the use of D&#8211;A units in nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy is still emerging, it holds great potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.







Abstract
Phototherapy&#8212;which includes photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;has evoked interest as a promising cancer treatment modality on account of its noninvasiveness, spatiotemporal precision, and minimal side effects. C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently reported a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle which consists of a donor (D) and an acceptor (A). Experimental results have demonstrated a potent immunotherapeutic effect of integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy in preclinical models. Incorporating D&#8211;A interactions into nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is still a novel approach. This approach offers a multifaceted strategy for synergistic cancer PIT which holds promising potential to transform cancer treatment paradigms.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizers: From Fundamental Principles to Advanced Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic concepts of designing activatable photosensitizers are established in this Review by closely examining quenching mechanisms and bioresponsive constructs essential for their function. New strategies developed in the last five years that address the shortcomings of conventional activatable photosensitizers and which enhance selectivity are also summarized.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment that uses light to excite photosensitizers in target tissue, producing reactive oxygen species and localized cell death. It is recognized as a minimally invasive, clinically approved cancer therapy with additional preclinical applications in arthritis, atherosclerosis, and infection control. A hallmark of ideal PDT is delivering disease&#8208;specific cytotoxicity while sparing healthy tissue. However, conventional photosensitizers often suffer from non&#8208;specific photoactivation, causing off&#8208;target toxicity. Activatable photosensitizers (aPS) have emerged as more precise alternatives, offering controlled activation. Unlike traditional photosensitizers, they remain inert and photoinactive during circulation and off&#8208;target accumulation, minimizing collateral damage. These photosensitizers are designed to &#8220;turn on&#8221; in response to disease&#8208;specific biostimuli, enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing off&#8208;target effects. This review explores the principles of aPS, including quenching mechanisms stemming from activatable fluorescent probes and applied to activatable photosensitizers (RET, PeT, ICT, ACQ, AIE), as well as pathological biostimuli (pH, enzymes, redox conditions, cellular internalization), and bioresponsive constructs enabling quenching and activation. We also provide a critical assessment of unresolved challenges in aPS development, including limitations in targeting precision, selectivity under real&#8208;world conditions, and potential solutions to persistent issues (dual&#8208;lock, targeting moieties, biorthogonal chemistry and artificial receptors). Additionally, it provides an in&#8208;depth discussion of essential research design considerations needed to develop translationally relevant aPS with improved therapeutic outcomes and specificity.

         <title>Overcoming Boundaries: Towards the Ambient Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The traditional solvothermal method, often requiring harsh conditions, has limited the large&#8208;scale synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in the aqueous synthesis of COFs. It also presents the limitations and future perspectives of the aqueous synthesis methods.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has traditionally been carried out under strict solvothermal and anaerobic conditions. The utilization of organic solvents in such reactions not only carries significant costs but also imposes a great burden on the environment. The fabrication of COFs using alternative synthetic pathways has, therefore, seen rapid development in recent years and much attention has been placed on green and sustainable methods in particular. The synthesis of COFs in purely aqueous media, however, remains challenging due to the delicate nature of the chemical reactions and the crystallization process in water. This mini&#8208;review discusses different synthetic strategies for the construction of crystalline COFs in aqueous media and offers a perspective on the future development of facile COF synthesis in ambient conditions.

         <title>Photoexcited Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Halogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge of photoinitiated transition&#8208;metal catalysis has provided a novel gateway to access carbo&#8208;heteroatom bonds and molecular space that was not been previously attainable. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds has sought out new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and limiting stoichiometric additives. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, hoping to expand the synthesis toolkit for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has proven useful in facilitating carbon&#8208;halogen (C&#8722;X) bond formation. Despite the vast number of methodologies reported to furnish these bonds, limitations have remained, warranting continued development. The recent surge of metallaphotoredox&#8208;based transformations has provided a novel gateway to bypass these limitations. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds arise through new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and stoichiometric additives. The discovery of this novel strategy has provided access to molecular space that has not been previously attainable. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed C&#8722;X bond formation, in hopes of easing the synthetic endeavours for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.

         <title>An Amorphous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer with Both High Charge Carrier Mobility and Luminescence Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, which exhibits both high charge carrier mobility and luminescence quantum efficiency. With a &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of approximately 0.084&#8197;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting polymer IDT&#8208;BT, TTIF&#8208;BT demonstrates significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic semiconducting polymers play a pivotal role in the development of field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, structural versatility, and solution processability. However, achieving polymers with both high charge carrier mobility (&#956;) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;) remains a challenge. In this work, we present the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, featuring a di&#8208;Thioeno[3,2&#8208;b] ThioenoIndeno[1,2&#8208;b] Fluorene (TTIF) backbone as the donor component. TTIF&#8208;BT exhibits comparable hole mobility and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting IDT&#8208;BT, leading to a remarkable &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of ~0.084&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Through time&#8208;resolved absorption and PL techniques, we propose a model to extract the spectral weight of interchain&#8208;mediated emissions, yielding 62&#8201;% in TTIF&#8208;BT. Our results introduce a high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer, which has potential use in next&#8208;generation organic optoelectronic devices, including electrically&#8208;driven polymer lasers and active&#8208;matrix display technologies.

         <title>Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates is presented using a transition metal&#8208;free route through a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization on gram scale. Terephthalates were readily converted into aromatic diisocyanates in flow and used to synthesize 100&#8201;% renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.







Abstract
Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum&#8208;derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D&#8208;galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram&#8208;scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram&#8208;scale preparation of 1,4&#8208;phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5&#8208;toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high&#8208;pressure gases or costly transition&#8208;metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.

         <title>Catalytic Amino Group Transfer Reactions Mediated by Photoinduced Nitrene Formation from Rhodium&#8208;Hydroxamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photoinduced generation of Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoids and their catalytic nitrene transfer reactivity using thermally stable, yet photoactive Rh&#8208;hydroxamate. Combined EPR, mass, and DFT studies suggested that Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid species could be furnished via the photoactivation of Rh&#8208;hydroxamates. Further catalytic amidation reactivity of hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to form new C&#8722;N, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds was explored.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic platform to access transient nitrenoids by designing photo&#8208;responsive neutral rhodium&#8208;hydroxamate complexes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometric analysis, suggest that electrophilic Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid intermediates could be generated via photoactivation of corresponding Rh&#8208;hydroxamates via N&#8208;O bond homolysis and redox event. Moreover, catalytic acylnitrenoid transfer was explored toward the amidation of various hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to furnish new N&#8722;C, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a photocatalytic platform to access transient nitrenoids by designing photo-responsive neutral rhodium-hydroxamate complexes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometric analysis, suggest that electrophilic Fischer-type Rh-acylnitrenoid intermediates could be generated via photoactivation of corresponding Rh-hydroxamates via N-O bond homolysis and redox event. Moreover, catalytic acylnitrenoid transfer was explored toward the amidation of various hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to furnish new N&#8722;C, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct CO2 Activation and Conversion to Ethanol via Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to activate and convert CO2 in dissolved as well as gaseous form via reactive oxygen species was established. Within only 5&#8197;h reaction time at atmospheric conditions, room temperature a conversion efficiency of 92&#8201;% from CO2 to 12.2&#8197;mmol/L ethanol was achieved. Direct Air Capture experiments gave similar results, which showcases both the inherent flexibility of this method as well as its efficiency.







Abstract
The growing demand for energy and the excessive use of fossil fuels represents one of the main challenges for humanity. Storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuels or value&#8208;added chemicals without creating additional environmental burdens is a key requirement for a sustainable future. Here we use biomimetic artificial photosynthesis and present a dPCN&#8208;224(H) MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic system, which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate and convert CO2 to ethanol under atmospheric conditions, at room temperature and in 2&#8211;5&#8197;h reaction time. The system provides a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion efficiency (CTE) of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, this method also allows the conversion of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC), making it a rapid and versatile method for both dissolved and gaseous CO2.

         <title>Charge Polarization Boosting Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrite in Dilute Concentrations with a Unity Carbon Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual site catalyst Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C with single Fe atom and Cu NPs on N&#8208;doped carbon to enhance the coupling of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N) for urea synthesis. The Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high FEurea of 50.05&#8201;% with a flow cell at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized.







Abstract
Synthesis of urea through electrocatalytic coupling reaction of CO2 with nitrite (NO2&#8722;) represents a sustainable means to substitute the conventional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthetic protocol. The direct conversion of dilute NO2&#8722; in real wastewaters to urea with high efficiency is still a significant challenge, as C&#8208;intermediates tend to go through an extensive reduction achieving mostly C&#8208;containing productions due to the lack of N&#8208;intermediates, originating from slow diffusion rate of NO2&#8722;. Herein, we report the charge&#8208;polarized Fe&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Cu&#948;+ dual sites in metal/carbon heterojunction material (Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; solution (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N). The electron&#8208;rich single Fe atoms dispersed N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) restrain *CO desorption, and the electron&#8208;deficient Cu nanoparticles (Cu) promote the deep reduction of NO2&#8722; to *NH2. As a result, the obtained Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for urea of 50.05&#8201;% with a yield of 850.57&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in a flow cell. Moreover, Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized. The present results provide a valuable reference for the design of new catalysts for efficient synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds in dilute NO2&#8722; solution.

         <title>Halogenated Trityl Cations as Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Access Super Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation and the further functionalization of its para&#8208;fluorine atoms via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This enables the synthesis of equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives, that can be handled at room&#8208;temperature. Their super&#8208;electrophilicity is demonstrated by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.







Abstract
Herein, we present the easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation (15F+) with commercial GaCl3 and the further functionalization of the para&#8208;fluorine atoms of 15F+ via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This gives access to equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives (p&#8208;3Cl12F+ and p&#8208;3Br12F+), which can be handled at room temperature. The impact of the para&#8208;exchange on the electronic structure is determined by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the new synthons&#8242; high hydride ion affinities are demonstrated computationally and experimentally by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.
