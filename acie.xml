         <title>Alkynyl Boosted High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage&#160;and Mechanism in Covalent Phenanthroline Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor conductivity of the pristine bulk covalent&#160;organic material is the main challenge for its application in energy storage and the mechanism of symmetric alkynyl bonds (C&#8801;C) in covalent&#160;organic materials for lithium storage is still rarely reported. Herein, a nanosized (~80 nm) alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent&#160;phenanthroline framework (Alkynyl&#8208;CPF) is&#160;designed and&#160;synthesized for the first time to improve the intrinsic charge conductivity and the insolubility of the covalent&#160;organic material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. On account of the high degree of electron conjugation along alkynyl units and N atoms from phenanthroline groups, Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrodes with the lowest HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (&#916;E=2.629&#160;eV) show improved intrinsic conductivity by density functional theory&#160;(DFT) calculations. Therefore, the pristine Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode delivers superior cycling performance with a large reversible capacity and outstanding rate properties (1068.0 mA h g&#8208;1&#160;after 300 cycles at 100 mA g&#8208;1&#160;and 410.5 mA h g&#8208;1&#160;after 700 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1). Moreover, by Raman, FT&#8208;IR, XPS, EIS, and theoretical simulations, the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of C&#8801;C units and phenanthroline groups in the Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode has been deeply probed.&#160;This work may provide new strategies and insights for the design and mechanism of covalent&#160;organic materials in electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Pore&#8208;Shape Fixing in a Soft Porous Molecular Crystal &#8211; Navigating the Phase Interconversion Landscape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore&#8208;shape fixing effects (PSFEs) in soft porous crystals are a relatively unexplored area of materials chemistry. We report the PSFE in the prototypical dynamic van der Waals solid p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (TBC4). Starting with the high&#8208;density guest&#8208;free phase, two porous shape&#8208;fixed phases were programmed using the stimuli of CO2 pressure and temperature. A suite of complementary in situ techniques, including variable&#8208;pressure (VP) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP&#8208;powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP&#8208;differential scanning calorimetry, volumetric sorption analysis and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy was used to track dynamic guest&#8208;induced transformations, providing molecular&#8208;level insight into the PSFE. The interconversion between the two metastable phases is particle size dependent, making this the second example of the PSFE by crystal downsizing, and the first example involving a porous molecular crystal: larger particles undergo reversible transitions while smaller particles remain fixed in the metastable phase. A complete phase interconversion scheme was constructed for the material, thus allowing navigation of the phase interconversion landscape of TBC4 using the easily&#8208;applied stimuli of CO2 pressure and thermal treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed Tetranuclear Iron&#8208;oxo Clusters with Redox Activity for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) are considered as promising catalysts with unique redox activity at the molecular level for energy storage. However, eco&#8208;friendly iron&#8208;oxo clusters with special metal coordination structures have rarely been reported for Li&#8208;ion storage. Herein, three novel redox&#8208;active tetranuclear iron&#8208;oxo clusters have been synthesized using the solvothermal method with different ratios of Fe3+ and SO42&#8208;.Further, they can serve as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, cluster&#160;H6[Fe4O2(H2O)2(SO4)7]&#8226;H2O, the stable structure extended by SO42&#8208; with a unique 1D pore, displays a specific discharge capacity of 1784 mAh&#8226;g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and good cycle performance (at 0.2 C and 4 C). This is the first instance of inorganic iron&#8208;oxo clusters being used for Li&#8208;ion storage. Our findings present a new molecular model system with a well&#8208;defined structure and offer new design concepts for the practical application of studying the multi&#8208;electron redox activity of iron&#8208;oxo clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;entropy Electrolyte Enables High Reversibility and Long Lifespan for Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stable cycling of Mg&#8208;metal anodes is limited by several problems, including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and passivation at the Mg surface. In this study, we present a high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of lithium triflate (LiOTf) and trimethyl phosphate (TMP) co&#8208;added to magnesium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2/1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of Mg&#8208;metal anodes. The as&#8208;formed high&#8208;entropy Mg2+&#8208;2DME&#8208;OTf&#8208;&#8208;Li+&#8208;DME&#8208;TMP solvation structure effectively reduced the Mg2+&#8211;DME interaction in comparison with that observed in traditional Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolytes, thereby preventing the formation of insulating components on the Mg&#8208;metal anode and promoting its electrochemical kinetics and cycling stability. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the high&#8208;entropy solvation structure brought OTf&#8208; and TMP to the surface of the Mg&#8208;metal anode and promoted the formation of a Mg3(PO4)2&#8208;rich interfacial layer, which is beneficial for enhancing Mg2+ conductivity. Consequently, the Mg&#8208;metal anode achieved excellent reversibility with a high Coulombic efficiency of 98% and low voltage hysteresis. This study provides new insights into the design of electrolytes for Mg&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphth[4]arene: Synthesis, Conformations, and Application in Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Crystalline Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite macrocyclic arene chemistry has achieved rapid development in recent years, the synthesis of new macrocyclic arenes from the aromatic rings with no directing groups remains a considerable challenge. In this work, a new type of macrocyclic arene, naphth[4]arene (NA[4]A), composed of four naphthalene rings bridged by methylene groups, was successfully synthesized by a macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;macrocycle conversion strategy. NA[4]A shows 1,3&#8208;alternate and 1,2&#8208;alternate conformations in solid state, and they can be selectively obtained. By supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of NA[4]A and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in different concentrations and ambient temperatures, two conformation&#8208;dependent crystalline luminescent co&#8208;assemblies 1,2&#8208;NTC and 1,3&#8208;NTC can be selectively prepared as well. Interestingly, the two charge transfer crystalline assemblies containing NA[4]A with different conformation emit bright yellow and green fluorescence, respectively, and also display high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 45% and 43%. Furthermore, the two crystalline assemblies can exhibit color&#8208;tunable two&#8208;photon excited upconversion emission property. This work provides a new perspective and route for fabricating color&#8208;tunable supramolecular crystalline luminescent materials regulated by the conformations of macrocyclic arene.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multifunctional Liquid Crystal as Hole Transport Layer Additive Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) has been identified as the most used and effective p&#8208;dopant for hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI in HTL negatively impact PSCs performance and stability. Herein, we report an effective strategy for adding a liquid crystal organic small molecule (LQ) into Li&#8208;TFSI doped (2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208; spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) HTL. It was found that the introduction of LQ into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTL can efficiently enhance the charge carrier extraction and transportation in device, which can strongly retard the charge&#8208;carrier recombination in device. Consequently, the PSCs efficiency is significantly enhanced to 24.42% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD+LQ) from 21.03% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD). The chemical coordination between LQ and Li&#8208;TFSI can strongly confine Li+ ions migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI, thus, achieving the enhanced device stability. Only a 9% efficiency degradation is observed for un&#8208;encapsulated device prepared with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and LQ after 1700 h under air environment, while the efficiency drops by 30% for the reference device. This work provides an effective strategy for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs, and gives some important insights for understanding intrinsic HCs dynamics for HCs&#8208;enhanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA&#8208;gated and self&#8208;protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme&#8208;Pd0 with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy.Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities could improve the catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy.

         <title>The Metabolostasis Network and the Cellular Depository of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vital role of metabolites across all branches of life and their involvement in various disorders have been investigated for decades. Many metabolites are poorly soluble in water or in physiological buffers and tend to form supramolecular aggregates. On the other hand, in the cell, they should be preserved in a pool and be readily available for the execution of biochemical functions. We thus propose that a quality&#8208;control network, termed &#8216;metabolostasis&#8217;, has evolved to regulate the storage and retrieval of aggregation&#8208;prone metabolites. Such a system should control metabolite concentration, subcellular localization, supramolecular arrangement, and interaction in dynamic environments, thus enabling normal cellular physiology, healthy development, and preventing disease onset. The paradigm&#8208;shifting concept of metabolostasis calls for a reevaluation of the traditional view of metabolite storage and dynamics in physiology and pathology and proposes unprecedented directions for therapeutic targets under conditions where metabolostasis is imbalanced.</dc:description>

         <title>When Weak Is Strong: A Plea for Low&#8208;Affinity Binders for Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein labeling is a cornerstone of fluorescence microscopy. This is achieved using covalent or high&#8208;affinity target labels, which leads to a loss in fluorescence signal with time. Here, we highlight the new avenue of using reversible fluorophore labels, which exhibit a low binding affinity to their target and constantly &#8220;renew&#8221; the fluorescence signal. This enables novel biophysical applications across imaging platforms.







Abstract
The exploitation of low&#8208;affinity molecular interactions in protein labeling is an emerging topic in optical microscopy. Such non&#8208;covalent and low&#8208;affinity interactions can be realized with various concepts from chemistry and for different molecule classes, and lead to a constant renewal of fluorescence signals at target sites. Further benefits are a versatile use across microscopy methods, in 3D, live and many&#8208;target applications. In recent years, several classes of low&#8208;affinity labels were developed and a variety of powerful applications demonstrated. Still, this research field is underdeveloped, while the potential is huge.

         <title>Switchable Fluorescent Light&#8208;Up Aptamers Based on Riboswitch Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of switchable fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers is created by adopting a conformational switching principle derived from natural riboswitches. The aptamers can be activated or deactivated with RNA triggers or small molecules like guanine and adenine, providing highly sensitive switches with minimal signal leakage.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) such as Spinach or Mango can bind small fluorogens and activate their fluorescence. Here, we adopt a switching mechanism otherwise found in riboswitches and use it to engineer switchable FLAPs that can be activated or repressed by trigger oligonucleotides or small metabolites. The fluorophore binding pocket of the FLAPs comprises guanine (G) quadruplexes, whose critical nucleotides can be sequestered by corresponding anti&#8208;FLAP sequences, leading to an inactive conformation and thus preventing association with the fluorophore. We modified the FLAPs with designed toehold hairpins that carry either an anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence within the loop region. The addition of an input RNA molecule triggers a toehold&#8208;mediated strand invasion process that refolds the FLAP into an active or inactive configuration. Several of our designs display close&#8208;to&#8208;zero leak signals and correspondingly high ON/OFF fluorescence ratios. We also modified purine aptamers to sequester a partial anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence to control the formation of the fluorogen&#8208;binding conformation, resulting in FLAPs whose fluorescence is activated or deactivated in the presence of guanine or adenine. We demonstrate that switching modules can be easily combined to generate FLAPs whose fluorescence depends on several inputs with different types of input logic.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Remote Borylation of Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective functionalization of racemic alkyl halides is an efficient strategy to assemble complex chiral molecules, but remains one of the biggest challenges in organic chemistry. The distant and selective activation of unreactive C&#8722;H bonds in alkyl halides has received growing interest as it enables rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple building blocks. Here, we reported a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed remote borylation of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8722;X, X = I, Br, Cl, OTs) with borane (HBpin) and presented a robust approach for the generation of valuable chiral secondary organoboronates from racemic alkyl halides. This migration borylation reaction is compatible with primary, secondary, and tertiary bromides, offering direct access to a broad range of alkylboronates. The extension of this catalytic system to the borylation of aryl halides was also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that this remote borylation involved a radical reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the slow water dissociation process limits the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In their Research Article (e202300873), Emiliano Cort&#233;s et&#8197;al. designed an atomically asymmetric local electric field using Ir&#8208;Ru dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to optimize the dissociation process by tuning the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation.

&lt;p&gt;Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the slow water dissociation process limits the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202300873"&gt;e202300873&lt;/a&gt;), Emiliano Cort&#233;s et&#8197;al. designed an atomically asymmetric local electric field using Ir-Ru dizygotic single-atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to optimize the dissociation process by tuning the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption configuration and orientation. As a result, IrRu DSACs exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;current density in a single cell and a high stability over 300&#8197;h at 1 A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;in a membrane electrode assembly.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Driven Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a concept for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate that is driven by substoichiometric amounts of electrons, introduced electrochemically. This protocol enables access to a variety of nitro&#8208;derived molecules from unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, in addition to promoting ipso&#8208;nitration reactions and nitrative cyclizations with high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. The mechanism of the reaction is supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this reaction has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy to scale for decagram quantities, and exhibit exceptional substrate generality and functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Modulation of Uptake and Reactivity of Nitrogen Dioxide in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of NO2 is modulated in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3, which leads to reaction between NO2 and framework Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A higher NO2 dynamic uptake (6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) is achieved, compared with the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305 (2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 in which unbound N&#8208;centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter&#8208;balanced by Cl&#8722; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO2 into MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 leads to reaction between NO2 and Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K is observed for MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 as measured using a flow of 500&#8197;ppm NO2 in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO2 molecules within MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 and MFM&#8208;305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high&#8208;field solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV/Vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.

         <title>Bispalladium(II) Complexes of di&#8208;p&#8208;Pyrirubyrin Derivatives as Promising Near&#8208;Infrared Photoacoustic Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the synthesis and mutually reversible, fully controlled transformations of bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrins. The regioselective conversion of di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin into dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin leads to the incorporation of an unprecedented &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocycle skeleton. Significantly, all reported compounds have outstanding spectroscopic properties, including a photoacoustic response in the near&#8208;infrared I&#8211;II range.







Abstract
The insertion of palladium(II) into di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin results in mutually convertible bimetallic complexes. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of one of them yielded bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin and, after demetallation, dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin, introducing for the first time the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocyclic frame. Bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 6, bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 9, and dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 10 absorb and emit light around 1000&#8197;nm and are characterized by high photostability. Thus, they are promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic dyes, ideally targeting (9) the wavelength of Yb&#8208;based fiber lasers. The incorporation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moiety into expanded porphyrins opens a highly interesting area of research due to the attractive optical and coordination properties of the resulting molecules.

         <title>Charting the Chemical Reaction Space around a Multicomponent Combination: Controlled Access to a Diverse Set of Biologically Relevant Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charting the reaction space around a known Multicomponent Reaction (MCR) allows the development of new processes. In this way, a detailed study of the parameters involved in the Orru transformation leads to the generation of alternative connectivities featuring diversely substituted imidazolones, including GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) chromophores, coelenterazine derivatives, natural products, kinase inhibitors, and bioprobes.







Abstract
Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C&#8208;2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N&#8208;derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.

         <title>Postsynthetic Photochemical Modification and 2D Structuring of Zr&#8208;MOF Thin Films Containing Benzophenone Linker Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, porous and highly oriented films of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with benzophenone linker molecules were prepared as a new platform for photochemical postsynthetic modification. Potential reactivities range from targeted functionalization of the inner and outer surface, through grafting&#8208;from polymerization to true 2D patterning of defined structures.







Abstract
For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation MOF&#8208;based devices the availability of highly adaptable materials in suitable shapes is crucial. Here, we present thin films of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) containing photoreactive benzophenone units. Crystalline, oriented and porous films of the zirconium&#8208;based bzpdc&#8208;MOF (bzpdc=benzophenone&#8208;4&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) are prepared by direct growth on silicon or glass substrates. Via a subsequent photochemical modification of the Zr&#8208;bzpdc&#8208;MOF films, various properties can be tuned postsynthetically by covalent attachment of modifying agents. Apart from the modification with small molecules, also grafting&#8208;from polymerization reactions are possible. In a further extension, 2D structuring and photo&#8208;writing of defined structures is also possible, for example by using a photolithographic approach, paving the way towards micro&#8208;patterned MOF surfaces.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8211;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8211;glass composite membrane prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler produces a monolithic structure that eliminates non&#8208;selective grain boundaries, resulting in a preferential ultrahigh C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569 GPU and C2H6/C2H4 paraffin/olefin selectivity of 7.16.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8211;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569&#8197;gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding can play a significant role in designing complex bioinspired structures. Here, two different types of this interaction were employed to construct single and double helices from planar benzotellurazole amides.







Abstract
As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.

         <title>Macroscopic Assembly of Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Metal&#8208;free Supramolecular Glasses for Enhanced Color&#8208;tunable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized chiral metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses using L&#8208;histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as the building blocks can be obtained through a facile solution fabrication process. Visible color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence emissions are successfully realized in these glasses (namely L&#8208;H&#8208;M and L&#8208;H&#8208;M&#8208;AC). AC: acetonitrile; R.T.: room temperature; UV: Ultra Violet.







Abstract
Glassy materials, with desirable mechanical rigidity, shaping ability, high transparency, are attracting great interest in diverse fields. However, optically bulk molecule&#8208;based glasses are still rare, mainly due to limited monomeric species and harsh preparation conditions. Herein, we report a facile bottom&#8208;up solution fabrication process to obtain metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses (SMGs) at the macroscopic scale using L&#8208;Histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as building blocks. The chiral SMGs possess color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (decay lifetime up to 141.2&#8197;ms) and circular polarized luminescence (g factor up to 8.7&#215;10&#8722;3). The strong hydrogen bonds effectively drive the formation of SMGs, and provide a rigid microenvironment to boost triplet exciton generation. By virtue of excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent ultralong phosphorescence of the SMGs, applications including multicolored displays, visual UV detection, and persistently luminescent thermometer are demonstrated.

         <title>Structural Switching of a Distorted Trigonal Metal&#8208;Organic Cage to a Tetragonal Cage and Singlet Oxygen Mediated Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distorted trigonal cage 1 was synthesized by a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. 1 exhibited a complete structural switching in the presence of C70 to form tetragonal complex (C70)2@2. The acetonitrile&#8208;soluble PF6 analogue of (C70)2@2 was found to act as an excellent photosensitizer and catalyzed singlet oxygen mediated oxidation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Construction of metal&#8211;organic cages with unique architecture and guest binding abilities is highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of a distorted trigonal cage&#8197;(1) from a twisted tetratopic ligand (L) and a PdII acceptor. Surprisingly, 1 exhibited a complete structural reorganization of its building units in the presence of C70 and C60 to form guest&#8208;encapsulated tetragonal cages, (C70)2@2 and (C60)2@2, respectively. These guest&#8208;bound cages were found to be potential 1O2 generators, with the former effectively catalyzing two different varieties of 1O2&#8208;mediated oxidation reactions.

         <title>Leveraging Torsional and Steric Strains: A Pre&#8208;macrocyclization Strategy Enables Conformation&#8208;Specific Fullerene Binding in m&#8208;Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;tuning the torsion and steric effects of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyls shows that resorcinarenes devoid of hydrogen bonding could be conformationally locked into a crown in a predetermined way. The fluorescent rigid deep&#8208;crown synthesized by a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route, free&#8208;of covalent tethering, captures C60 in solution and solid&#8208;states as opposed to the flexible counterparts.







Abstract
Though the chemistry of resorcinarenes is half a century old, the conformationally&#8208;locked resorcinarene crowns are generally constructed using hydrogen bonds or covalent tethers. Often, covalent tethering involves extra post&#8208;macrocyclization steps involving upper&#8208;rim functionalities. We have leveraged the torsional and steric strains through &#945;&#8208;substituents of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyl chains and accomplished conformationally&#8208;rigid fluorescent m&#8208;cyclophane deep&#8208;crowns in a predetermined way. The strategy offers a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route conserving upper&#8208;rim functionalities, an aspect overlooked in resorcinarene chemistry. X&#8208;ray structural and computational analyses unveil the cause for conformational rigidity in m&#8208;cyclophanes due to &#945;&#8208;branching in C&#8208;alkyls (linear vs. &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;branched). The conformationally&#8208;locked fluorescent deep&#8208;crown with a preorganized cavity captures hydrophobic spherical guest C60 in both solution and solid states specifically, when compared to conformationally&#8208;dynamic boats, enabling conformation&#8208;specific binding.

         <title>A Significant Two&#8208;Dimensional Structural Transformation in a Coordination Polymer that Changes Its Electronic and Protonic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D structural transformation with a significant change in the coordination environment within the 2D layer was achieved in a copper&#8208;based coordination polymer in water at room temperature. The transformation led to large changes in the physical properties of the coordination polymers, such as proton conductivity and magnetism.







Abstract
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D (2D: two&#8208;dimensional) structural transformation accompanying significant bond rearrangement and coordination environment change is demonstrated in a coordination polymer (CP) comprised of copper(II) ions and terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;) ligands for the first time. When immersed in water, a free&#8208;standing membrane of 2D Cu(BDC)(DMF) (Cu&#8208;1; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) transforms into 2D Cu(BDC)(H2O)2 (Cu&#8208;2) while maintaining its highly oriented layered structure. In the 2D sheet, paddlewheel&#8208;type CuII dimers coordinated with four bidentate BDC ligands in a square&#8208;planar array in Cu&#8208;1 were released to form uniform aqua&#8208;bridged CuII chains, which are cross&#8208;linked with each other by unidentate BDC ligands, in Cu&#8208;2. The present facile approach to implement the 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transformation accompanied by bond rearrangement, which is characteristic of CPs, leads to a marked increase in in&#8208;plane magnetic susceptibility and proton conductivity. In situ experiments in support of theoretical calculations unveiled the energy diagram that governs the unique structural transformation.

         <title>Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheets Stabilized by Hydrogen Bond Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes the synthesis of turn&#8208;less &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics. Synthetic &#946;&#8208;turns are important components of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics; however, the impact of the designed &#946;&#8208;turns on &#946;&#8208;sheet stabilization is often dependent on the strand sequence. We show that conformationally&#8208;defined macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics can be accessed by replacing interstrand hydrogen bonds with covalent bonds.







Abstract
Mimics of protein secondary and tertiary structure offer rationally&#8208;designed inhibitors of biomolecular interactions. &#946;&#8208;Sheet mimics have a storied history in bioorganic chemistry and are typically designed with synthetic or natural turn segments. We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter&#8208;&#946;&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally&#8208;defined macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic &#946;&#8208;turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of a protein &#946;&#8208;sheet. To access turn&#8208;less antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein &#946;&#8208;sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over&#8208;abundance of aromatic&#8211;aromatic, cation&#8208;&#960; and ionic interactions in &#946;&#8208;sheets. In correspondence with natural &#946;&#8208;sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust &#946;&#8208;sheet formation when specific amino acid residue pairings are incorporated. In isolated &#946;&#8208;sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies, along with high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystallography, support our design principles.

         <title>Birefringence Regulation by Clarifying the Relationship Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs and Optical Anisotropy in Tin&#8208;based Ternary Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;performance relationship has been teased out between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy for analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides.







Abstract
It is important to establish and clarify the relationship between stereochemically active lone pairs and birefringence, since it is one of the significantly effective routes to explore birefringent crystals by introducing Sn&#8208;centered polyhedra with stereochemically active lone pairs. Herein, four tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides A3SnCl5 and ASn2Cl5 (A=NH4 and Rb) have been synthesized successfully. The experimental birefringence of Rb3SnCl5 and RbSn2Cl5 is larger than or equal to 0.046 and 0.123@546&#8197;nm, respectively. Through investigating the alkali or alkaline&#8208;earth metal tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides, the structure&#8208;performance relationship has been concluded between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy. It is beneficial to the analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin&#8208;based halides and provides a guide for exploring tin(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic functional materials.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;fueled Mechanical Motions with Dynamic Phosphorescence Induced by Topochemical [2+2] Reactions in Organoboron Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/sun light enables fast macroscopic photomechanical motions and blue&#8208;shifted phosphorescence emission, owing to quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photocyloaddition reactions, in stoichiomorphic organoboron crystals. X&#8208;ray photodiffraction structural mapping of photosalient crystals, during rapid topochemical transformation, deciphers an atomic&#8208;level mechanism for the origin of the photomechanical motions.







Abstract
In the quest for essential energy solutions towards an ecological friendly future, the transformation of visible light/solar energy into mechanical motions in metal&#8208;free luminescent crystals offers a sustainable choice of smart materials for lightweight actuating, and all&#8208;organic electronic devices. Such green energy&#8208;triggered photodynamic motions with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in molecular crystals have not been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate three new stoichiometrically different Lewis acid&#8208;base molecular organoboron crystals (PS1, PS2, and PS3), which exhibit rapid photosalient effects (ballistic splitting, moving, and jumping) under both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light associated with quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) [2+2] cycloaddition of preorganized olefins. Furthermore, these systems respond to sunlight and mobile (white) flashlight with a complete SCSC transformation in a relatively slow fashion. Remarkably, all PS1, PS2, and PS3 crystals display visible light&#8208;promoted dynamic green RTP as their emission peaks promptly blue&#8208;shift, due to instantaneous photomechanical effects. Time&#8208;dependent structural mapping of intermediate photoproducts during fast SCSC [2+2] photoreaction, by X&#8208;ray photodiffraction, reveals a rationale for the origin of these photodynamic motions associated with rapid topochemical transformations. The reported light&#8208;driven behavior (mechanical motions, dynamic phosphorescence, and topochemical reactivity), is considered advantageous for the strategic design of stimuli&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;functional crystalline materials.

&lt;p&gt;Visible/sun light enables fast macroscopic photomechanical motions and blue-shifted phosphorescence emission, owing to quantitative single-crystal-to-single-crystal [2+2] photocyloaddition reactions, in stoichiomorphic organoboron crystals. X-ray photodiffraction structural mapping of photosalient crystals, during rapid topochemical transformation, deciphers an atomic-level mechanism for the origin of the photomechanical motions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quest for essential energy solutions towards an ecological friendly future, the transformation of visible light/solar energy into mechanical motions in metal-free luminescent crystals offers a sustainable choice of smart materials for lightweight actuating, and all-organic electronic devices. Such green energy-triggered photodynamic motions with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in molecular crystals have not been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate three new stoichiometrically different Lewis acid-base molecular organoboron crystals (PS1, PS2, and PS3), which exhibit rapid photosalient effects (ballistic splitting, moving, and jumping) under both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light associated with quantitative single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) [2+2] cycloaddition of preorganized olefins. Furthermore, these systems respond to sunlight and mobile (white) flashlight with a complete SCSC transformation in a relatively slow fashion. Remarkably, all PS1, PS2, and PS3 crystals display visible light-promoted dynamic green RTP as their emission peaks promptly blue-shift, due to instantaneous photomechanical effects. Time-dependent structural mapping of intermediate photoproducts during fast SCSC [2+2] photoreaction, by X-ray photodiffraction, reveals a rationale for the origin of these photodynamic motions associated with rapid topochemical transformations. The reported light-driven behavior (mechanical motions, dynamic phosphorescence, and topochemical reactivity), is considered advantageous for the strategic design of stimuli-responsive multi-functional crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Origin of Viscosity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screened overlapping method (SOM) was developed to effectively compute the viscosity of liquid electrolytes. Based on this method, it is revealed that strong intermolecular interactions give rise to the high viscosity of liquid electrolytes and impede the motion of species in electrolytes.







Abstract
Viscosity is an extremely important property for ion transport and wettability of electrolytes. Easy access to viscosity values and a deep understanding of this property remain challenging yet critical to evaluating the electrolyte performance and tailoring electrolyte recipes with targeted properties. We proposed a screened overlapping method to efficiently compute the viscosity of lithium battery electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulations. The origin of electrolyte viscosity was further comprehensively probed. The viscosity of solvents exhibits a positive correlation with the binding energy between molecules, indicating viscosity is directly correlated to intermolecular interactions. Salts in electrolytes enlarge the viscosity significantly with increasing concentrations while diluents serve as the viscosity reducer, which is attributed to the varied binding strength from cation&#8211;anion and cation&#8211;solvent associations. This work develops an accurate and efficient method for computing the electrolyte viscosity and affords deep insight into viscosity at the molecular level, which exhibits the huge potential to accelerate advanced electrolyte design for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Promoted Rapid Photomechanical Motions of Single Crystals of a Triene Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural symmetry&#8208;enhanced phase transition has been induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition in a triene coordination polymer. Under irradiation with UV light, its single crystals show abundant photomechanical motions, such as, jumping, bending, bursting, rolling, splitting, and cracking.







Abstract
Molecular crystals with the ability to transform light energy into macroscopic mechanical motions are a promising class of materials with potential applications in actuating and photonic devices. In regard to such materials, coordination polymers that exhibit dynamic photomechanical motion, associated with a phase transition, are unknown. Herein, we report an intriguing photoactive, one&#8208;dimensional ZnII coordination polymer, 1, derived from 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethenylbenzene and 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate. Single crystals of 1 under UV light irradiation exhibit rapid shrinking and bending, violent bursting&#8208;jumping, splitting, and cracking behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveal an unusual photoinduced phase transition involving a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction that results in photomechanical responses. Interestingly, crystals of 1, which are triclinic with space group 
, are transformed into a higher symmetry, monoclinic cell with space group C2/c. This process represents a rare example of symmetry enhancement upon photoirradiation. The photomechanical activity is likely due to the sudden release of stress associated with strained molecular geometries and significant solid&#8208;state molecular movement arising from cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. A composite membrane fabricated from 1 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) also displays interesting photomechanical behavior under UV light illumination, indicating the material's potential as a photoactuator.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unambiguous assignment of NMR signals to complex organic molecules or mixtures is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202304196), Jin Wook&#8197;Cha, Min&#8208;Seon Kim, and Jin&#8208;Soo Park suggest an ultrahigh&#8208;resolution single&#8208;scan NMR method that enables to acquire a hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both 1H, 13C and their correlation spectra. The method was applied to compounds with high NMR signal complexity, such as chromopeptide and diastereomeric mixtures, and resulted in complete 1H and 13C NMR signal assignment of individual subunits and epimers.

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a sterically distorted distibene ([4]2) and its transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity towards two fundamental feedstock chemicals: H2 and ethylene. Although [4]2 exhibits an unusually long Sb=Sb distance and noticeable backbone distortion in the solid state, NMR data suggest that [4]2 remains predominantly as a dimer in solution, even at high temperatures. However, it was proposed that the elusive reactivity of [4]2 toward H2 and ethylene results from reversible dissociation of [4]2 into the transient stibinidene ([4]), which could be observed by NMR spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Solvothermal: Alternative Synthetic Methods for Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous organic materials that hold a wealth of potential applications across various fields. The development of COFs, however, is significantly impeded by the dearth of efficient synthetic methods. The traditional solvothermal approach, while prevalent, is fraught with challenges such as complicated processes, excessive energy consumption, long reaction times, and limited scalability, rendering it unsuitable for practical applications. The quest for simpler, quicker, more energy&#8208;efficient, and environmentally benign synthetic strategies is thus paramount for bridging the gap between academic COF chemistry and industrial application. This Review provides an overview of the recent advances in alternative COF synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on energy input. We discuss representative examples of COF synthesis facilitated by microwave, ultrasound, mechanic force, light, plasma, electric field, and electron beam. Perspectives on the advantages and limitations of these methods against the traditional solvothermal approach are highlighted.</dc:description>

We discuss representative examples of COF synthesis facilitated by microwave, ultrasound, mechanic force, light, plasma, electric field, and electron beam. Perspectives on the advantages and limitations of these methods against the traditional solvothermal approach are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8327;Be&#8326;B&#8327;: A Boron&#8208;Beryllium Sandwich Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar boron clusters have often been regarded as &#8220;pi&#8208;analogous&#8221; to aromatic arenes because of their similar delocalized pi&#8208;bonding. However, unlike arenes such as C5H5&#8722; and C6H6, boron clusters have not previously shown the ability to form sandwich complexes. In this study, we present the first sandwich complex involving beryllium&#8208;and boron, B7Be6B7. The global minimum of this combination adopts a unique architecture having a D6h geometry, featuring an unprecedented monocyclic Be6 ring sandwiched between two quasi&#8208;planar B7 motifs. The thermochemical and kinetic stability of B7Be6B7 can be attributed to strong electrostatic and covalent interactions between the fragments. Chemical bonding analysis shows that B7Be6B7 can be considered as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex. Moreover, there is a significant electron delocalization within this cluster, supported by the local diatropic contributions of the B7 and Be6 rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitchable Benzimidazole Azo&#8208;Arenes as beta&#8208;Arrestin2&#8208;Biased Selective Cannabinoid 2 Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) has high therapeutic potential for multiple pathogenic processes, such as neuroinflammation. Pathway&#8208;selective ligands are needed to overcome the lack of clinical success and to elucidate correlations between pathways and their respective therapeutic effects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a photoswitchable scaffold based on the privileged structure of benzimidazole and its application as a functionally selective CB2R &#8220;efficacy&#8208;switch&#8221;. Benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes offer huge potential for the broad extension of photopharmacology to a wide range of optically addressable biological targets. We used this scaffold to develop compound 10d, a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221; agonist, which serves as a molecular probe to study the &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) pathway at CB2R. &#946;Arr2 bias was observed in CB2R internalization and &#223;arr2 recruitment, while no activation occurred when looking at G&#945;16 or mini&#8208;G&#945;i. Overall, compound 10d is the first light&#8208;dependent functionally selective agonist to investigate the complex mechanisms of CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 dependent endocytosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenative Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination Using a Chiral Pyridine&#8208;Derived Half&#8208;Sandwich Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral amines are broadly used compounds in pharmaceutical industry and organic synthesis, and reductive amination reactions have been the most appreciated methods for their syntheses. However, one&#8208;step transfer hydrogenative direct asymmetric reductive amination (THDARA) that could expand the scope, simplify the operation and eliminate the use of additives has been challenging. In this work, based on the Xiao&#8217;s racemic transfer hydrogenative reductive amination in 2010 and our recent work in novel chiral pyridine ligands, chiral half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalysts were rationally designed and synthesized. Using the optimized catalyst and azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine as the hydrogen source, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;chiral (hetero)aryl amines, including various polar functional groups and heterocycles, were prepared in generally high yield and enantioselectivity under mild and operationally simple conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the catalytically active Ir&#8211;H species and the key hydride transfer step supported the chiral pyridine&#8208;induced stereospecific generation of the iridium center, and the enantioselection by taming the highly flexible key transition structure with multiple attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions. This work introduced a type of effective chiral catalysts for simplified approach to medicinally important chiral amines, as well as a rare example of robust enantioselective transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright free radical emission in ionic liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to achieve stable and efficient radical emissions under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a rational design strategy to protect photoinduced carbonyl free radical emission through electrostatic interaction and spin delocalization effect. The host&#8208;guest system is constructed via tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules and a series of imidazolium ionic liquids as the guest and host, respectively, in which the carbonyl anion radical emission can be in situ generated under the light irradiation and further stabilized by electrostatic interaction. More importantly, the anion species and the alkyl chain length of imidazolium ionic liquids show a noticeable effect on luminescence efficiency, and the highest radical emission efficiency is as high as 53.3% after optimizing the imidazole ionic liquid&#8217;s structure, which is about four times higher than the polymer protect radical system. The theoretical calculations confirm the synergistic effect of strong electrostatic interactions and the spin delocalization effect significantly stabilizes the radical emission. Moreover, such a radical emission system also could be integrated with the fluorescence dye to induce multi&#8208;color or even white light emission with reversible temperature&#8208;responsive characteristics. Lastly, the radical emission system also can be used to detect different amine compounds based on the emission change and distant photoactivation time.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond amination by using a chiral cationic copper catalyst and oxidant di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide is reported. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Chiral benzylic amines are privileged motifs in pharmacologically active molecules. Intramolecular enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer has emerged as a straightforward, powerful tool for the synthesis of chiral amines, but methods for intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination remain elusive. Herein, we report a cationic copper catalytic system for intermolecular enantioselective benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H amination with peroxide as an oxidant. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. More importantly, it can be used to synthesize bioactive molecules, including chiral drugs. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the amination reaction involves benzylic radicals generated by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>A Glycosidic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Based Mass&#8208;Spectrometry&#8208;Cleavable Cross&#8208;linker Enables In Vivo Cross&#8208;linking for Protein Complex Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosidic&#8208;bond&#8208;based mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker has been developed that enables in vivo cross&#8208;linking for analyzing protein complexes. The MS&#8208;cleavable glycosidic bond of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) improves the accuracy of identification while increasing the search throughput. In addition, in vivo cross&#8208;linking is enabled in the living cell microenvironment because of the high biocompatibility, bioorthogonality, and amphipathicity of TDS.







Abstract
Chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful technology to analyze protein complexes. However, the progress of in vivo CXMS studies has been limited by cross&#8208;linking biocompatibility and data analysis. Herein, a glycosidic bond&#8208;based MS&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) was designed and synthesized, which was fragmented in MS under CID/HCD to simplify the cross&#8208;linked peptides into conventional single peptides via selective cleavage between glycosidic and peptide bonds under individual MS collision energy. Consequently, the cross&#8208;linking identification accuracy and throughput were significantly enhanced, and the popular MS mode of stepped HCD was allowed. In addition, TDS showed proper cell&#8208;penetrating properties while being highly water&#8208;soluble, making it non&#8208;DMSO dependent during solubilization. Collectively, TDS provides a promising toolkit for CXMS characterization of living systems with high biocompatibility and accuracy.

&lt;p&gt;A glycosidic-bond-based mass-spectrometry-cleavable cross-linker has been developed that enables in vivo cross-linking for analyzing protein complexes. The MS-cleavable glycosidic bond of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) improves the accuracy of identification while increasing the search throughput. In addition, in vivo cross-linking is enabled in the living cell microenvironment because of the high biocompatibility, bioorthogonality, and amphipathicity of TDS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful technology to analyze protein complexes. However, the progress of in vivo CXMS studies has been limited by cross-linking biocompatibility and data analysis. Herein, a glycosidic bond-based MS-cleavable cross-linker of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) was designed and synthesized, which was fragmented in MS under CID/HCD to simplify the cross-linked peptides into conventional single peptides via selective cleavage between glycosidic and peptide bonds under individual MS collision energy. Consequently, the cross-linking identification accuracy and throughput were significantly enhanced, and the popular MS mode of stepped HCD was allowed.

         <title>Structure and Bonding in Amorphous Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous red phosphorus (a&#8208;P) can be described on the atomic scale by combining emerging machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based and dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT approaches. The a&#8208;P models reported here complete the first&#8208;principles stability range of the phosphorus allotropes, and they allow for new insight into chemical bonding and electronic states.







Abstract
Amorphous red phosphorus (a&#8208;P) is one of the remaining puzzling cases in the structural chemistry of the elements. Here, we elucidate the structure, stability, and chemical bonding in a&#8208;P from first principles, combining machine&#8208;learning and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) methods. We show that a&#8208;P structures exist with a range of energies slightly higher than those of phosphorus nanorods, to which they are closely related, and that the stability of a&#8208;P is linked to the degree of structural relaxation and medium&#8208;range order. We thus complete the stability range of phosphorus allotropes [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 11629] by now including the previously poorly understood amorphous phase, and we quantify the covalent and van der Waals interactions in all main phases of phosphorus. We also study the electronic densities of states, including those of hydrogenated a&#8208;P. Beyond the present study, our structural models are expected to enable wider&#8208;ranging first&#8208;principles investigations&#8212;for example, of a&#8208;P&#8208;based battery materials.

         <title>Electrical Pulse&#8208;Driven Periodic Self&#8208;Repair of Cu&#8208;Ni Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a programmable pulsed electrolysis strategy to achieve reliable Cu/Cu2O structure, where Cu is oxidized to CuO during oxidation pulse, then regenerating Cu/Cu2O upon reduction. Compared to static NO3&#8722; electroreduction on Cu, the generated Cu/Cu2O enables breaking the rate&#8208;determining step of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in superior performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction sustainably produces ammonia and alleviates water pollution, yet is still challenging due to the kinetic mismatch and hydrogen evolution competition. Cu/Cu2O heterojunction is proven effective to break the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; step for efficient NH3 conversion, while it is unstable due to electrochemical reconstruction. Here we report a programmable pulsed electrolysis strategy to achieve reliable Cu/Cu2O structure, where Cu is oxidized to CuO during oxidation pulse, then regenerating Cu/Cu2O upon reduction. Alloying with Ni further modulates hydrogen adsorption, which transfers from Ni/Ni(OH)2 to N&#8208;containing intermediates on Cu/Cu2O, promoting NH3 formation with a high NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Faraday efficiency (88.0&#177;1.6&#8201;%, pH&#8197;12) and NH3 yield rate (583.6&#177;2.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) under optimal pulsed conditions. This work provides new insights to in situ electrochemically regulate catalysts for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of DNA Amphiphiles is Driven by Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular DNA nanosheets resembling bilayer membranes are obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of triblock DNA amphiphiles incorporating Cy3 chromophores. The hydrophobic chromophores are found to interact in a sequence&#8208;dependent manner with the hydrophilic DNA on the sheet surface, generating a chiral &#8220;signature&#8221; only upon formation of the thermodynamically stable nanosheet morphology.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies of water&#8208;soluble block copolymers have been limited by a dearth of systematic studies that relate polymer structure to pathway mechanism and supramolecular morphology. Here, we employ sequence&#8208;defined triblock DNA amphiphiles for the supramolecular polymerization of free&#8208;standing DNA nanosheets in water. Our systematic modulation of amphiphile sequence shows the alkyl chain core forming a cell membrane&#8208;like structure and the distal &#960;&#8208;stacking chromophore block folding back to interact with the hydrophilic DNA block on the nanosheet surface. This interaction is crucial to sheet formation, marked by a chiral &#8220;signature&#8221;, and sensitive to DNA sequence, where nanosheets form with a mixed sequence, but not with a homogeneous poly(thymine) sequence. This work opens the possibility of forming well&#8208;ordered, bilayer&#8208;like assemblies using a single DNA amphiphile for applications in cell sensing, nucleic acid therapeutic delivery and enzyme arrays.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Photocage Based on a Ruthenium Complex for Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru complex&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by NIR light was designed and was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers which self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, Ru complexes are released from the nanoparticles and effectively inhibit tumor proliferation in mice via combined chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, demonstrating the promising anticancer applications of the Ru&#8208;based photocage in vivo.







Abstract
Conventional photocages only respond to short wavelength light, which is a significant obstacle to developing efficient phototherapy in vivo. The development of photocages activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light at wavelengths from 700 to 950&#8197;nm is important for in vivo studies but remains challenging. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a photocage based on a ruthenium (Ru) complex with NIR light&#8208;triggered photocleavage reaction. The commercial anticancer drug, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), was coordinated to the RuII center to create the Ru&#8208;based photocage that is readily responsive to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm. The photocage inherited the anticancer properties of THC. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we further engineered a self&#8208;assembled photocage&#8208;based nanoparticle system with amphiphilic block copolymers. Upon exposure to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm, the Ru complex&#8208;based photocages were released from the polymeric nanoparticles and efficiently inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Response with Radical Afterglow by Regulation of Spin Populations and Hole&#8208;Electron Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive radical materials with afterglow were developed. Spin populations and hole&#8208;electron analyses revealed that appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for stability and electronic transitions of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type radicals. Further on, the stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors and multistage energy transfers were fully explored to expand the radical emission property.







Abstract
No matter photoinduced organic radicals have been reported frequently, they are usually non&#8208;luminescent at ambient conditions. The internal mechanism on stability and electronic transitions of photoinduced radicals, is thus crucial for the development of relevant materials. Herein, a series of photoinduced radical emission systems were developed conveniently through doping benzoic acids into the hydrogen donor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Visual photoinduced radical emission and photochromism could be observed on Ph&#8208;3COOH@PVA film with the formation of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type structure. For the first time, radical afterglow appeared with energy transfer from triplet state. The appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for decreasing spin population and promoting electronic transitions of the radical. This study largely expands the radical emission property from both internal mechanism and practical application.

         <title>The Telluraboranes closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 and closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 with Exceptionally Long Body Diagonals: Synthetic and Bonding Motifs for Innovative Octahedral and Icosahedral Geometries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the first small&#8208;sized polyhedral telluraborane, i.e. closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5, has been achieved in a two&#8208;component, one&#8208;pot thermal reaction of diboron tetrachloride and tellurium tetrachloride. The co&#8208;pyrolysis also generates the icosahedral closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11. The assembly of electron&#8208;deficient polyhedral frameworks from small, electron&#8208;precise precursory molecules provides a unique entry into the field of heteroatom&#8208;containing boranes.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 (1) and twelve&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 (2) telluraboranes have been prepared via co&#8208;pyrolysis of B2Cl4 with TeCl4 in vacuo at temperatures between 360&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. Both compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids, and they have been characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B&#8197;NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectroscopy. Both ab initio/GIAO/NMR and DFT/ZORA/NMR computations support octahedral and icosahedral geometries for 1 and 2, respectively, as expected due to their closo&#8208;electron counts. The octahedral structure of 1 has been confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on an incommensurately modulated crystal. The corresponding bonding properties have been analyzed in terms of the intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) approach. 1 is the first example of a polyhedral telluraborane with a cluster size smaller than 10 vertices.

         <title>Minimizing Temperature Bias through Reliable Temperature Determination in Gas&#8208;Solid Photothermal Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of temperature determination bias in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions was systematically uncovered. Further, a universal protocol was developed, including the reasonable system optimization for ameliorating the temperature distribution and temperature control of the catalyst layer, accompanied by cross&#8208;corroboration of multiple thermometry for reliable temperature assessment in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.







Abstract
Enormous advances in photothermal catalysis have been made over the years, whereas the temperature assessment still remains controversial in the majority of photothermal catalytic systems. Herein, we methodically uncovered the phenomenon of temperature determination bias arising from prominent temperature differences in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic systems, which extensively existed yet has been overlooked in most relevant cases. To avoid the interference of temperature bias, we developed a universal protocol for reliable temperature evaluation of gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions, with emphasis on eliminating the temperature gradient and temperature fluctuation of catalyst layer via optimizing the reaction system. This work presents a functional and credible practice for temperature detection, calling attention to addressing the effects of temperature differences, and reassessing the actual temperature&#8208;based performances in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Elastin&#8208;Like Peptide&#8208;Based Targeted Nanoparticles for Enhanced Spheroid Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;responsive targeted nanoparticle based on elastin&#8208;like polypeptides and loaded with photosensitizers, is able to transform rapidly into a small nanocluster for enhanced penetration into spheroids. The nanocluster still has its targeting function and thus is highly efficient in both cargo delivery and cell&#8208;killing in photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We describe here a near infrared light&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like peptide (ELP)&#8208;based targeted nanoparticle (NP) that can rapidly switch its size from 120 to 25&#8197;nm upon photo&#8208;irradiation. Interestingly, the targeting function, which is crucial for effective cargo delivery, is preserved after transformation. The NPs are assembled from (targeted) diblock ELP micelles encapsulating photosensitizer TT1&#8208;monoblock ELP conjugates. Methionine residues in this monoblock are photo&#8208;oxidized by singlet oxygen generated from TT1, turning the ELPs hydrophilic and thus trigger NP dissociation. Phenylalanine residues from the diblocks then interact with TT1 via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, inducing the re&#8208;formation of smaller NPs. Due to their small size and targeting function, the NPs penetrate deeper in spheroids and kill cancer cells more efficiently compared to the larger ones. This work could contribute to the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; nanomedicines with deeper penetration capacity for effective anticancer therapies.

The nanocluster still has its targeting function and thus is highly efficient in both cargo delivery and cell-killing in photodynamic therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe here a near infrared light-responsive elastin-like peptide (ELP)-based targeted nanoparticle (NP) that can rapidly switch its size from 120 to 25&#8197;nm upon photo-irradiation. Interestingly, the targeting function, which is crucial for effective cargo delivery, is preserved after transformation. The NPs are assembled from (targeted) diblock ELP micelles encapsulating photosensitizer TT1-monoblock ELP conjugates. Methionine residues in this monoblock are photo-oxidized by singlet oxygen generated from TT1, turning the ELPs hydrophilic and thus trigger NP dissociation. Phenylalanine residues from the diblocks then interact with TT1 via &#960;-&#960; stacking, inducing the re-formation of smaller NPs. Due to their small size and targeting function, the NPs penetrate deeper in spheroids and kill cancer cells more efficiently compared to the larger ones. This work could contribute to the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; nanomedicines with deeper penetration capacity for effective anticancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Biomolecules with Carbon Nanotubes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensors for the neurotransmitter dopamine are reported. These sensors change their fluorescence lifetime and this is measured by pulsed excitation and single&#8208;photon counting. Lifetimes are sensitive to the concentration of dopamine, which can be used for imaging dopamine release by cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are versatile near infrared (NIR) fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Their surface is chemically tailored to respond to analytes by a change in fluorescence. However, intensity&#8208;based signals are easily affected by external factors such as sample movements. Here, we demonstrate fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of SWCNT&#8208;based sensors in the NIR. We tailor a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for NIR signals (&gt;800&#8197;nm) and employ time correlated single photon counting of (GT)10&#8208;DNA functionalized SWCNTs. They act as sensors for the important neurotransmitter dopamine. Their fluorescence lifetime (&gt;900&#8197;nm) decays biexponentially and the longer lifetime component (370&#8197;ps) increases by up to 25&#8201;% with dopamine concentration. These sensors serve as paint to cover cells and report extracellular dopamine in 3D via FLIM. Therefore, we demonstrate the potential of fluorescence lifetime as a readout of SWCNT&#8208;based NIR sensors.

Janus&#8208;like covalent/ionic crosslinked hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;loaded protocells were constructed and used as integrated platforms for domain&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics.







Abstract
Despite an emerging catalogue of collective behaviours in communities of homogeneously distributed cell&#8208;like objects, microscale protocell colonies with spatially segregated populations have received minimal attention. Here, we use microfluidics to fabricate Janus&#8208;like calcium alginate hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;containing inorganic colloidosomes and investigate their potential as integrated platforms for domain&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics. Diffusive chemical signalling within the segregated communities gives rise to increased initial enzyme kinetics compared with a homogeneous distribution of protocells. We employ competing enzyme&#8208;mediated hydrogel crosslinking and decrosslinking reactions in different domains of the partitioned colonies to undertake selective expulsion of a specific protocell population from the community. Our results offer new possibilities for the design and construction of spatially organized cytomimetic consortia capable of endogenous chemical processing and protocell&#8208;environment interactivity.

         <title>Paired Oxidative and Reductive Catalysis: Breaking the Potential Barrier of Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired electrocatalysis strategy for alkane functionalization is reported for the first time, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. Importantly, C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of alkanes with ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential (&#8776;0.25&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) is achieved using this protocol, providing a modular method for versatile mono&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted olefins under mild conditions.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsic inertness of alkanes, strong oxidative conditions are typically required to enable their C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, a paired electrocatalysis strategy was developed by integrating oxidative catalysis with reductive catalysis in one cell without interference, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. This approach lowers the previously high oxidation potential required for alkane activation, enabling electrochemical alkane functionalization at the ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential of &#8776;0.25&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl under mild conditions. Structurally diverse alkenes, including challenging all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted olefins, can be accessed using readily available alkenyl electrophiles.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Spinel ZnCo2O4 through Filling Oxygen Vacancies with Fluorine for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we successfully filled the lattice oxygen vacancies of ZnCo2O4 with F atom, achieving the activation of lattice oxygen by regulating metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization, and the dominant oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on ZnCo2O4 can transform from adsorbate evolution mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism.







Abstract
The development of productive catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge requiring significant progress in both mechanism and material design. Conventionally, the thermodynamic barrier of lattice oxidation mechanism (LOM) is lower than that of absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) because the former can overcome certain limitations. However, controlling the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the catalyst remains challenging. Herein, we incorporated F anions into the oxygen vacancies of spinel ZnCo2O4 and established a link between the electronic structure and the OER catalytic mechanism. Theoretical density calculations revealed that F upshifts the O 2p center and activates the redox capability of lattice O, successfully triggering the LOM pathway. Moreover, the high electronegativity of F anions is favourable for balancing the residual protonation, which can stabilize the structure of the catalyst.

         <title>A Space&#8208;Confined Polymerization Templated by Ice Enables Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sheets of a conjugated polymer were prepared via a space&#8208;confined polymerization method that uses ice as a template. The key step of this strategy is the transportation of monomer to ice crystal boundaries using micelles as carriers, followed by oxidative polymerization in a frozen state. After characterization, the 2D sheets were assembled to self&#8208;standing films and found to exhibit excellent performance when used as electrodes in supercapacitors.







Abstract
Despite significant progress in the preparation and characterization of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, the synthesis of 2D organic materials remains challenging. Here, we report a novel space&#8208;confined polymerization method that enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis of 2D sheets of a functional conjugated polymer, namely, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A key step in this method is the confinement of monomer to the boundaries of ice crystals using micelles. This spatial confinement directs the polymerization to form 2D PEDOT sheets with high crystallinity and controlled morphology. Supercapacitors prepared from the 2D PEDOT sheets exhibit outstanding performance metrics. In aqueous electrolyte, a high areal specific capacitance of 898&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 along with an excellent rate capability is achieved (e.g., capacitance retention of 67.6&#8201;% at a 50&#8208;fold higher current). Moreover, the 2D PEDOT&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.5&#8201;% after 30,000 cycles). Device performance is further improved when an organic electrolyte is used.

     alt="A Space-Confined Polymerization Templated by Ice Enables Large-Scale Synthesis of Two-Dimensional Polymer Sheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) sheets of a conjugated polymer were prepared via a space-confined polymerization method that uses ice as a template. The key step of this strategy is the transportation of monomer to ice crystal boundaries using micelles as carriers, followed by oxidative polymerization in a frozen state. After characterization, the 2D sheets were assembled to self-standing films and found to exhibit excellent performance when used as electrodes in supercapacitors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite significant progress in the preparation and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) materials, the synthesis of 2D organic materials remains challenging. Here, we report a novel space-confined polymerization method that enables the large-scale synthesis of 2D sheets of a functional conjugated polymer, namely, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A key step in this method is the confinement of monomer to the boundaries of ice crystals using micelles. This spatial confinement directs the polymerization to form 2D PEDOT sheets with high crystallinity and controlled morphology. Supercapacitors prepared from the 2D PEDOT sheets exhibit outstanding performance metrics. In aqueous electrolyte, a high areal specific capacitance of 898&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; along with an excellent rate capability is achieved (e.g., capacitance retention of 67.6&#8201;% at a 50-fold higher current). Moreover, the 2D PEDOT-based supercapacitors exhibit outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.5&#8201;% after 30,000 cycles). Device performance is further improved when an organic electrolyte is used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Approach to Solution&#8208;Processible Small&#8208;Molecule Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters for High&#8208;Performance Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is developed, and the resulting narrowband emissive organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 27.1&#8201;% and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 31&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Most multi&#8208;resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters generally exhibit strong aggregation and relatively worse solubility due to their rigid and planar molecule structures, which is highly undesirable for solution&#8208;processible devices. Herein, a simple but feasible approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule MR&#8208;TADF emitters is developed by incorporating two MR&#8208;TADF units onto carbazole bridge bearing long alkyl chains. The obtained emitters demonstrate supreme film&#8208;forming capability and narrowband emissions with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 22&#8197;nm. The resulting solution&#8208;processed narrowband electroluminescent devices achieve maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;%, which represents the highest efficiency among the solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters. This simple approach reveals great potential of developing solution&#8208;processible emitters for rigid and planar molecular structures.

         <dc:description>
Thiazolylazopyrazoles are developed as nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches that achieve (near&#8208;)quantitative isomerization in both directions by o&#8208;substitution. The Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;lives can be prolonged to several days through inducing attractive intramolecular interactions to an o&#8208;carbonyl group on the pyrazole. In contrast, o&#8208;methylation of the pyrazole results in a destabilizing effect.







Abstract
Following the progress on mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches (Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Ph), a few bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches (Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het) have been studied recently, whereas the nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl ones (Het1&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het2) that can combine the respective merits of each heterocycle, have received little attention. Here we report thiazolylazopyrazoles as nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches that combine the visible&#8208;light switching character of the thiazole ring and the ease of o&#8208;substitution of the pyrazole ring. Thiazolylazopyrazoles can achieve (near&#8208;)quantitative visible&#8208;light isomerization in both directions and long Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives of several days. In contrast to the drastically destabilizing effect of o&#8208;methylation, o&#8208;carbonylation of the pyrazole ring can remarkably stabilize Z isomers by inducing attractive intramolecular interactions (dispersion, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N bond, and lone&#8208;pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction). Our work highlights the importance of the rational combination of two heterocycles and suitable structural substitution in developing bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.

         <title>Not So Innocent After All: Interfacial Chemistry Determines Charge&#8208;Transport Efficiency in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial chemistry of a single&#8208;molecule junction plays a pivotal role in determining the final charge&#8208;transport efficiency. Internal charge reorganisation is responsible for the observed behaviour, and the results provide a general, intuitive strategy for the structural design of efficient molecular wires.







Abstract
Most studies in molecular electronics focus on altering the molecular wire backbone to tune the electrical properties of the whole junction. However, it is often overlooked that the chemical structure of the groups anchoring the molecule to the metallic electrodes influences the electronic structure of the whole system and, therefore, its conductance. We synthesised electron&#8208;accepting dithienophosphole oxide derivatives and fabricated their single&#8208;molecule junctions. We found that the anchor group has a dramatic effect on charge&#8208;transport efficiency: in our case, electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;pyridyl contacts suppress conductance, while electron&#8208;rich 4&#8208;thioanisole termini promote efficient transport. Our calculations show that this is due to minute changes in charge distribution, probed at the electrode interface. Our findings provide a framework for efficient molecular junction design, especially valuable for compounds with strong electron withdrawing/donating backbones.

         <title>Delayed Doublet Emission in a Cerium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a CeIII complex with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which is realized by a small positive energy gap &#916;ETD between the doublet (D1) and triplet (T1) excited states. The &#916;ETD is deduced to be 0.220&#8197;eV from the Arrhenius plot. The mechanism discovered enriches our understandings about the excited state relaxation process and may bring insights into rational energy level regulation of doublet emission.







Abstract
Doublet emission from open&#8208;shell molecules has demonstrated its research and application value in recent years. However, understandings of the photoluminescence mechanism of open&#8208;shell molecules are far less than that of closed&#8208;shell molecules, leading to challenges in molecular design of efficient doublet emission systems. Here we report a cerium(III) 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbozol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl&#8208;tris(pyrazolyl)borate complex Ce(CzPhTp)3 with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which also represents the first example with metal&#8208;centered delayed photoluminescence. The energy gap between the doublet and triplet excited states of Ce(CzPhTp)3 is reduced by the management of the inner and outer coordination spheres, thereby promoting efficient energy transfer between the two excited states and activating the delayed emission. The photoluminescence mechanism discovered may provide a new way for the design of efficient doublet emission and bring insights into rational molecular design and energy level regulation in open&#8208;shell molecules.

         <title>A General and Practical Route to Functionalized Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane&#8208;Heteroaryls Enabled by Photocatalytic Multicomponent Heteroarylation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a conceptually different approach to access diverse arylated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs). A wide variety of alkyl radicals derived from alkyltrifluoroborates and alkylsilicates were successfully incorporated to form a range of synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized heteroarylated BCPs. Moreover, more electron&#8208;deficient &#8901;CF2H or &#8901;CF3 radicals were also found to be amenable, affording fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heteroaryl BCPs







Abstract
1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are an important class of BCP derivatives with widespread application in drug development. Most syntheses of these materials require multiple chemical steps via BCP electrophiles or nucleophiles derived from [1.1.1]propellane. Although one&#8208;step, multicomponent radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions could provide a more sustainable and rapid route to access diverse heteroarylated BCPs, current approaches are limited to tertiary alkyl radicals, leading to a decrease in their practical value. In this study, a conceptually different approach enabled by a radical multicomponent heteroarylation of [1.1.1]propellane to access functionalized heteroarylated BCPs is described. Importantly, this protocol is compatible with primary&#8208;, secondary&#8208;, and tertiary aliphatic radicals, as well as various fluoroalkyl radical sources, thus enabling rapid library generation of sought&#8208;after BCP derivatives for drug development.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Carbon&#8208;Sequestrated Seawater into Stoichiometric CO and HClO with Nitrogen&#8208;Doped BiOCl Atomic Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers can directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater into stoichiometric CO and HClO under visible light with selectivities greater than 90&#8201;%. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships.







Abstract
Seawater is one of the most important CO2 sequestration media for delivering value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels and active chlorine; however, this scenario is plagued by sluggish reaction rates and poor product selectivity. Herein, we first report the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers to directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater (Yellow Sea, China) into stoichiometric CO (92.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and HClO (83.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light with selectivities greater than 90&#8201;%. Photoelectrons enriched on the exposed BiOCl{001} facet kinetically facilitate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction via surface&#8208;doped nitrogen bearing Lewis basicity. Photoholes, mainly located on the lateral facets of van der Waals gaps, promote the selective oxidation of Cl&#8722; into HClO. Sequestrated CO2 also maintains the pH of seawater at around 4.2 to prevent the alkaline earth cations from precipitating. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships, offering a green and safe way for onsite sterilization.

         <title>Photocatalytic Metal Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mediated Allene Functionalization by Cobalt and Titanium Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is on the photo Co metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction for chemoselective allene functionalization by using Co&#8208;porphines as catalysts and the Hantzsch ester as an H atom and electron donor. The merger of Co MHAT and Ti catalysis under photoredox conditions enabled successful carbonyl allylation, providing access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reactions have proven to be a powerful method for alkene functionalization. This work reports the discovery of Co&#8208;porphines as highly efficient MHAT catalysts with a loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% for unprecedented chemoselective allene functionalization under photoirradiation. Moreover, the newly developed bimetallic strategy by the combination of photo Co&#8208;MHAT and Ti catalysis enabled the successful carbonyl allylation with a wide range of amino, oxy, thio, aryl, and alkyl&#8208;allenes providing expedient access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols in over 100 examples with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations supported that selectively transferring hydrogen atoms from cobalt hydride to allenes and generating allyl radicals is the key step in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction for Preparing Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed to construct a fused multicyclic linkage with high rigidity and a large contortion. A novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization was developed based on this reaction to prepare PIMs with high molecular weights, high specific surface areas, and H2 separation performance.







Abstract
It is a formidable challenge in polycondensation to simultaneously construct multiple covalent bonds to prepare double&#8208;stranded polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with fused multicyclic linkages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction for successfully preparing double&#8208;stranded PIMs with fused multicyclic backbone structures. A self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed based on the [4+2] cycloaddition of sym&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyne (DIBOD) and ortho&#8208;quinone compounds. In this reaction, the cycloaddition of ortho&#8208;quinone with the first alkyne of DIBOD activates the second alkyne, which reacts with ortho&#8208;quinone at a rate constant 192 times larger than that of the original alkyne. Using this self&#8208;accelerating reaction to polymerize DIBOD and spirocyclic/cyclic difunctional ortho&#8208;quinone monomers, a novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization method was developed to prepare PIMs. The resultant PIMs possess intrinsic ultramicropores with pore sizes between 0.45 to 0.7&#8197;nm, high specific surface areas above 646&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and good H2 separation performance.

         <title>Magnetism in Nonplanar Zigzag Edge Termini of Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended 7&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon with unique termini structures was synthesized on Au(111) using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. A Kondo resonance was observed for termini with nonplanar zigzag edges even on a bare Au(111) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag terminus resulted from its weak interaction with the Au(111) because of its nonplanar conformation.

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and nanographenes synthesized by on&#8208;surface reactions using tailor&#8208;made molecular precursors offer an ideal playground for a study of magnetism towards nano&#8208;spintronics. Although the zigzag edge of GNRs has been known to host magnetism, the underlying metal substrates usually veil the edge&#8208;induced Kondo effect. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended 7&#8208;armchair GNRs using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. Characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy revealed unique rearrangement reactions leading to pentagon&#8208; or pentagon/heptagon&#8208;incorporated, nonplanar zigzag termini, which demonstrated Kondo resonances even on bare Au(111). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nonplanar structure significantly reduces the interaction between the zigzag terminus and the Au(111) surface, leading to a recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag edge. Such a distortion of planar GNR structures offers a degree of freedom to control the magnetism on metal substrates.

&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Extended 7-armchair graphene nanoribbon with unique termini structures was synthesized on Au(111) using 7-bromo-12-(10-bromoanthracen-9-yl)tetraphene as the precursor. A Kondo resonance was observed for termini with nonplanar zigzag edges even on a bare Au(111) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag terminus resulted from its weak interaction with the Au(111) because of its nonplanar conformation.

         <title>Functionalized Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered carbocyclic rings are synthesized by stitching up all fjords of resorcin[4]arene derivatives through fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions and subsequent transformations of ketones. They are powerful and selective hosts to capture cesium ion to form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with binding constants being up to 1.5&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 1.7&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon belts have drawn great attention because of their unique structures and tantalizing properties. Although a few belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have been synthesized, belt molecules containing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain rare. Herein we report the construction and application of unprecedented zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis features fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions of resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived intermediates, which affords C4&#8208;symmetric tetrabenzobelt[4]arene[4]cyclooctatrienones. Stereoselective ketone reduction with LiAlH4 and nucleophilic addition with alkynyllithiums provide the corresponding tetrahydroxylated belts. The tetraol and its methyl ether are powerful and selective hosts to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with cesium ion, respectively, with binding constants up to (1.71&#177;0.33)&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2 and (1.50&#177;0.16)&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. In addition, enantiopure C4&#8208;symmetric belts can emit CPL with |glum| being around 0.01.

         <title>Designing Breathing Air&#8208;electrode and Enhancing the Oxygen Electrocatalysis by Thermoelectric Effect for Efficient Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>

We designed a new breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using P&#8208;type and N&#8208;type thermoelectrocatalysts as charge and discharge electrodes, respectively. Benefiting from the thermoelectric generated Seebeck voltages and carrier accumulation, the intrinsic oxygen catalytic activity was impressively enhanced. The breathing ZAB displayed a remarkable charge/discharge voltage gap and energy efficiency.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and mutual interference of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in the air electrode resulted in large charge/discharge overpotential and low energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, we designed a breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in the battery using P&#8208;type Ca3Co4O9 and N&#8208;type CaMnO3 as charge and discharge thermoelectrocatalysts, respectively. The Seebeck voltages generated from thermoelectric effect of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 synergistically compensated the charge and discharge overpotentials. The carrier migration and accumulation on the cold surface of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 optimized the electronic structure of metallic sites and thus enhanced their intrinsic catalytic activity. The oxygen evolution and reduction overpotentials were enhanced by 101 and 90&#8197;mV, respectively, at temperature gradient of 200&#8201;&#176;C. The breathing Zn&#8208;air battery displayed a remarkable energy efficiency of 68.1&#8201;%. This work provides an efficient avenue towards utilizing waste heat for improving the energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material containing 5,10&#8208;dimethyldihydrophenazine as active moieties is presented. Its electrochemical characterization revealed an anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry. Based on the optimized formula of cathode and electrolyte solution, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyldihydrophenazine) (PVDMP) cathode delivered high voltage, high capacity and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic electrode materials have attracted vast research attention owing to their designable structures and tunable electrochemical properties. Although n&#8208;type cathode materials could be used in various metal&#8208;ion batteries, p&#8208;type ones with high potential can deliver high energy density. Herein, we report a new p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine) (PVDMP), with a theoretical capacity of 227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. PVDMP featuring two&#8208;step redox reaction will be doped by two anions to maintain electroneutrality during oxidation, which resulted in an anion&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior of PVDMP&#8208;based cathode. The suitable dopant anion for PVDMP was selected and the doping mechanism was confirmed. Under the optimized condition, PVDMP cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and even remains 150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3900&#8197;cycles. This work not only provides a new kind of p&#8208;type organic cathode materials but also deepens the understanding of its anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling One&#8208;to&#8208;One Correspondence Between Excited Triplet States and Determinate Interactions by Temperature&#8208;Controllable Blue&#8208;Green&#8208;Yellow Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between excited triplet states and the determinate intermolecular interactions has been established for the first time, by temperature&#8208;controllable blue&#8208;green&#8208;yellow afterglow with hierarchically unlocking intermolecular interactions, which was further confirmed and improved by the deuterated analogue, guiding the accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.







Abstract
Phosphorescence of organic materials is highly dependent on intermolecular interactions, for the sensitive triplet excitons toward environment and aggregated structures. However, until now, relationship between phosphorescence and intermolecular interactions is still unclear for complicated influence factors and uncontrollable aggregated behaviors. Herein, taking temperature as the controlled variable, the afterglow can continuously change from blue to green, then to yellow, even achieve the white emission with deuteration process. It is mainly due to the hierarchical architectures of molecular aggregates with rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, as well as gradually unlocking process of interactions with different energies. Accordingly, the one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between the determinate interactions and excited triplet states have been established, guiding accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.

&lt;p&gt;The one-to-one correspondence between excited triplet states and the determinate intermolecular interactions has been established for the first time, by temperature-controllable blue-green-yellow afterglow with hierarchically unlocking intermolecular interactions, which was further confirmed and improved by the deuterated analogue, guiding the accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorescence of organic materials is highly dependent on intermolecular interactions, for the sensitive triplet excitons toward environment and aggregated structures. However, until now, relationship between phosphorescence and intermolecular interactions is still unclear for complicated influence factors and uncontrollable aggregated behaviors. Herein, taking temperature as the controlled variable, the afterglow can continuously change from blue to green, then to yellow, even achieve the white emission with deuteration process. It is mainly due to the hierarchical architectures of molecular aggregates with rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, as well as gradually unlocking process of interactions with different energies. Accordingly, the one-to-one correspondence between the determinate interactions and excited triplet states have been established, guiding accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Linear C=Ge=C Heteroallene with a Di&#8208;coordinated Germanium Atom
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable 2&#8208;germapropadiene adopts a linear structure in solution and the solid state: It has a formally sp&#8208;hybridized central germanium atom and two orthogonal C=Ge &#960;&#8208;bonds. The linear geometry arises from the negative hyperconjugation of the bulky silyl substituents at the terminal carbon atoms. The germanium atom is highly electrophilic and the allene&#8208;type character of the molecule is fully characterized and confirmed by its reactivity.







Abstract
Allenes (&gt;C=C=C&lt;) are classified as cumulated dienes with a linear structure and an sp&#8208;hybridized central carbon atom. We have synthesized and isolated a stable 2&#8208;germapropadiene with bulky silyl substituents. The 2&#8208;germapropadiene allene moiety adopts a linear structure both in the solid state and in solution. An X&#8208;ray diffraction electron&#8208;density&#8208;distribution (EDD) analysis of this 2&#8208;germapropadiene confirmed the linear C=Ge=C geometry with a formally sp&#8208;hybridized germanium atom that bears two orthogonal C=Ge &#960;&#8208;bonds. Based on detailed structural and computational studies, we concluded that the linear geometry of the isolated 2&#8208;germapropadiene most likely arises from the negative hyperconjugation of the silyl substituents at the terminal carbon atoms. The 2&#8208;germapropadiene reacts rapidly with nucleophiles, indicating that the linearly oriented germanium atom is highly electrophilic.

         <title>Decoding the Fucose Migration Product during Mass&#8208;Spectrometric analysis of Blood Group Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis of glycans. Here, ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations are used to deduce the product of the internal glycan rearrangement of two model trisaccharides.







Abstract
Fucose is a signaling carbohydrate that is attached at the end of glycan processing. It is involved in a range of processes, such as the selectin&#8208;dependent leukocyte adhesion or pathogen&#8208;receptor interactions. Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques, which are commonly used to determine the structure of glycans, frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis. The rearrangement leading to these fragments&#8212;often referred to as fucose migration&#8212;has been known for more than 25&#8197;years, but the chemical identity of the rearrangement product remains unclear. In this work, we combine ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations to deduce the product of the rearrangement in the model trisaccharides Lewis x and blood group H2. The structural search yields the fucose moiety attached to the galactose with an &#945;(1&#8594;6) glycosidic bond as the most likely product.

         <title>Insights into the Oxidative Degradation Mechanism of Solid Amine Sorbents for CO2 Capture from Air: Roles of Atmospheric Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processes for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 uniquely operate outdoors in different weather conditions. The oxidative stability of amine&#8208;based sorbents is a critical parameter with economic and environmental impacts on DAC processes. Here we elucidate the impact of ubiquitous atmospheric water vapor on the oxidative stability of DAC sorbents, providing insights into the design of robust sorbents for the practical deployment of DAC technology.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) processes for extraction of CO2 from ambient air are unique among chemical processes in that they operate outdoors with minimal feed pretreatments. Here, the impact of humidity on the oxidative degradation of a prototypical solid supported amine sorbent, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on Al2O3, is explored in detail. By combining CO2 adsorption measurements, oxidative degradation rates, elemental analyses, solid&#8208;state NMR and in situ IR spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with 18O labeling of water, a comprehensive picture of sorbent oxidation is achieved under accelerated conditions. We demonstrated that the presence of water vapor can play an important role in accelerating the degradation reactions. From the study we inferred the identity and kinetics of formation of the major oxidative products, and the role(s) of humidity. Our data are consistent with a radical mediated autooxidative degradation mechanism.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Advantaged Stereoregular Recyclable Plastics Enabled by Aluminum&#8208;Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Dithiolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions. By proper ligand design and modification, the aluminum catalysts enabled the production of highly isotactic, stereocomplexed polythioester. The obtained dithiolactone&#8208;based plastic is a tough semicrystalline material, and exhibits complete recyclability.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable polymers that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers are attractive candidates to replace non&#8208;recyclable petroleum&#8208;derived plastics. However, the physical properties and mechanical strengths of depolymerizable polymers are commonly insufficient for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5&#8197;kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a Tm of 94.5&#8201;&#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum&#8208;based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance&#8208;advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.

Bismacrocycles are presented. [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]As show multiple guest recognition and promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.02).







Abstract
Both pillar[n]arenes (P[n]As) and [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) play an important role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the precise synthesis of two multifunctional bismacrocycles [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A by integrating P[5]A into the [n]CPP backbone. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of the bismacrocycles was found to show a dramatic increase relative to the corresponding [n]CPPs. The chiral enantiomers (pR)/(pS)&#8208;[8]CPP&#8208;P[5]A were successfully isolated by chiral HPLC, and showed promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.02). In addition, [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A bismacrocycles are capable of binding pyridinium salts and fullerene derivatives with high affinity and specificity within the two distinct cavities. Transient absorption studies showed that photo&#8208;induced electron transfer occurs in [10]CPP&#8208;P[5]A&#8835;C60 complex. Our results suggest that [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A are potentially useful in CPL&#8208;active materials, multiple guest recognition and supramolecular polymer preparation.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Like Particle&#8208;Induced cGAS&#8208;STING Activation and AIM2 Inflammasome&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a virus&#8208;like particle loaded with densely packed DNA and covered with cationic liposomes. It not only induces liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activates STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines, but it also triggers the formation of AIM2 inflammasome and induces gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis to boost antitumor immunity, thus realizing efficient immunotherapy and tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;mediated DNA sensing is demonstrated to be critical for launching antitumor immunity. However, DNA&#8208;based cGAS&#8208;STING agonists are rarely reported owing to low cell permeability, poor biostability and, especially, limited length of exogenous DNA. Here, we present a virus&#8208;like particle which is self&#8208;assembled from long DNA building blocks generated through rolling&#8208;circle amplification (RCA) and covered with cationic liposomes. Based on long and densely packed DNA structure, it could efficiently induce liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activate STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, this virus&#8208;like particle could also trigger the formation of AIM2 inflammasome to induce gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, boosting antitumor immunity. Thus, this study provides a simple and robust strategy for cancer immunotherapy for clinical application. This is the first study to report the intrinsic immunogenicity of RCA products, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.

         <title>Controlled Continuous Evolution of Enzymatic Activity Screened at Ultrahigh Throughput Using Drop&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel nCAS9&#8208;mutagenic polymerase&#8208;based continuous evolution platform for improvement of enzymatic activity that functions at ultra&#8208;high throughput. By cycling cells between growth, mutagenesis, and microfluidics&#8208;based sorting, we mimic natural evolution but at a pace that is orders of magnitude faster, yielding an alditol oxidase variant with 10.5&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency for waste product, glycerol as a substrate.







Abstract
Enzymes are highly specific catalysts delivering improved drugs and greener industrial processes. Naturally occurring enzymes must typically be optimized which is often accomplished through directed evolution; however, this is still a labor&#8208; and capital&#8208;intensive process, due in part to multiple molecular biology steps including DNA extraction, in vitro library generation, transformation, and limited screening throughput. We present an effective and broadly applicable continuous evolution platform that enables controlled exploration of fitness landscape to evolve enzymes at ultrahigh throughput based on direct measurement of enzymatic activity. This drop&#8208;based microfluidics platform cycles cells between growth and mutagenesis followed by screening with minimal human intervention, relying on the nCas9 chimera with mutagenesis polymerase to produce in vivo gene diversification using sgRNAs tiled along the gene. We evolve alditol oxidase to change its substrate specificity towards glycerol, turning a waste product into a valuable feedstock. We identify a variant with a 10.5&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Mapping the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Gasoline Process Over Zeolite Beta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal and complementary spectroscopic strategy (involving operando UV/Visible spectroscopy coupled to online mass spectrometry and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) delivers a mechanistic blueprint of the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline process by elucidating the impact of carbonylated and oxymethylene species.







Abstract
Decarbonizing the transportation sector is among the biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. CO2&#8208;neutral fuels, such as those obtained from renewable methanol, have the potential to account for a large share of the solution, since these could be directly compatible with existing power trains. Although discovered in 1977, the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline (MTG) process has hardly reached industrial maturity, among other reasons, because maximizing the production of gasoline range hydrocarbons from methanol has proved complicated. In this work, we apply multimodal operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy coupled with an online mass spectrometer and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to better understand the reaction mechanism over zeolites H&#8208;Beta and Zn&#8208;Beta. Significantly, the influential co&#8208;catalytic role of oxymethylene species is linked to gasoline formation, which impacts the MTG process more than carbonylated species.

         <title>Tungstate&#8208;mediated In&#8208;situ Passivation of Grain Boundary Grooves in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a simple &#8220;two&#8208;step&#8221; in situ reaction approach to construct stable tungstate/perovskite (PVSK) heterointerfaces at grain boundary grooves (GBGs) in perovskite solar cells. The proposed passivation involved strong ionic bonds with explicitly tuned band energetics in the heterointerface. Accordingly, the uncoordinated Pb2+ could be effectively passivated via the tungstate ions, meanwhile the type&#8208;I PVSK/tungstate heterointerfaces could reduce recombination loss via repelling carriers from grain boundaries back to the intra&#8208;grain section. Thus, the resulting sample showed improved device performance both in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n and n&#8208;i&#8208;p structure, which demonstrated the universality and validity of our passivation strategy.







Abstract
Possessed with advantageous optoelectronic properties, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solution&#8208;processed solar cells. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly weakened by the carrier loss at grain boundary grooves (GBGs); however, it receives limited attention and there lacks effective approach to solve this issue. Herein, for the first time, we constructed the tungstate/perovskite heterointerface via a &#8220;two step&#8221; in situ reaction approach that provides effective defect passivation and ensures efficient carrier dynamics at the GBGs. The exposed perovskite at grain boundaries is converted to wide&#8208;band&#8208;gap PbWO4 via an in&#8208;situ reaction between Pb2+ and tungstate ions, which passivate defects due to the strong ionic bonding. Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO4 to CaWO4. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25&#8201;% in the n&#8208;i&#8208;p device and 23.33&#8201;% in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7&#8201;% after around 1100&#8197;h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5&#8201;% after aging in air for around 2110&#8197;h, and 93.1&#8201;% after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C in N2 for 972&#8197;h.

Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25&#8201;% in the n-i-p device and 23.33&#8201;% in the p-i-n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7&#8201;% after around 1100&#8197;h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5&#8201;% after aging in air for around 2110&#8197;h, and 93.1&#8201;% after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 972&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Colloidal Assembly Behavior Enables Printable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved in perovskite frameworks is visualized by investigating the precursor species. The feasibility of modulating the quantum wells structure for the fabrication of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite photovoltaics is further verified.







Abstract
The multiple quantum wells (QWs) distribution in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films hinders charge transport due to the fundamental difficulty of controlling crystal growth from precursor solutions, yielding poorly homogeneous low&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially in upscaling fabrication. Here, efficient low&#8208;dimensional PSCs are realized by modulating the colloidal assembly behavior in the precursor solution to induce intermediate structures. In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved lead iodide&#8208;dominated colloidal soft framework is visualized by investigating the precursor species differences under hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, solid&#8208;state reactions emerge and the formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite films exhibit significantly suppressed multiple QWs distribution. Encouragingly, the FA device (n=9, by meniscus&#8208;assisted coating) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.28&#8201;% for a size of 0.04&#8197;cm2 and a PCE of 15.35&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;module of 16.94&#8197;cm2 with superior stability.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable Metal Azolate Frameworks Showing Interesting Flexibilities for Highly Effective Bioethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As demonstrated by the extraordinary ethanol purification performances of a pore&#8208;opening adsorbent for various ethanol/water mixtures, the guest&#8208;dominated gating process, in which the preferentially&#8208;adsorbed guest serves as the gating component, is critical for achieving ultrahigh adsorption selectivity in large&#8208;pore adsorbents and avoiding the co&#8208;adsorption problem of pore&#8208;opening adsorbents.







Abstract
The ethanol/water separation challenge highlights the adsorption capacity/selectivity trade&#8208;off problem. We show that the target guest can serve as a gating component of the host to block the undesired guest, giving molecular sieving effect for the adsorbent possessing large pores. Two hydrophilic/water&#8208;stable metal azolate frameworks were designed to compare the effects of gating and pore&#8208;opening flexibility. Large amounts (up to 28.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) of ethanol with fuel&#8208;grade (99.5&#8201;%+) and even higher purities (99.9999&#8201;%+) can be produced in a single adsorption process from not only 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 but also 10&#8201;:&#8201;90 ethanol/water mixtures. More interestingly, the pore&#8208;opening adsorbent possessing large pore apertures showed not only high water adsorption capacity but also exceptionally high water/ethanol selectivity characteristic of molecular sieving. Computational simulations demonstrated the critical role of guest&#8208;anchoring aperture for the guest&#8208;dominated gating process.

         <title>Reversible Ammonium Ion Intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation with Crystal Water Promotion Effect in Layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O with a layered framework and two&#8208;dimensional channels has been demonstrated as the high&#8208;performance cathode material for aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, which delivered very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4&#8197;V and a high specific capacity of 154.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The crystal water in the layered host plays a key role in the structural stability and significantly promotes the NH4+ ion storage behavior.







Abstract
The non&#8208;metal NH4+ carrier has attracted tremendous interests for aqueous energy storage owing to its light molar mass and fast diffusion in aqueous electrolytes. Previous study inferred that NH4+ ion storage in layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O is impossible due to the removal of NH4+ from NH4VOPO4 leads to a phase change inevitably. Herein, we update this cognition and demonstrated highly reversible intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation behavior of NH4+ in layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O host. Satisfactory specific capacity of 154.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4&#8197;V based on reference electrode was achieved in VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O. A rocking&#8208;chair ammonium&#8208;ion full cell with the VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O//2.0&#8197;M NH4OTf//PTCDI configuration exhibited a specific capacity of 55&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, an average operating voltage of about 1.0&#8197;V and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 500&#8197;cycles with a coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99&#8201;%. Theoretical DFT calculations suggest a unique crystal water substitution process by ammonium ion during the intercalation process. Our results provide new insight into the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of NH4+ ions in layered hydrated phosphates through crystal water enhancement effect.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Detection of Trace Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) exhibits significant and sensitive fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; behavior for benzene vapor by virtue of unique &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions, enabling visual detection of a trace level of benzene for the first time.







Abstract
Indoor detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration is necessary due to the serious toxicity hazards even at trace level. However, physisorbents usually exhibit weak interactions especially in the presence of trace concentrations of VOCs, thus exhibiting poor responsive signal. Herein, we report a new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that exhibits interesting pore&#8208;opening behavior after immersing in H2O. The pore&#8208;opening phase shows significant (&#8776;116 folds) and extremely fast (&lt;1&#8197;minute) fluorescence enhancement after being exposed to saturated benzene vapor. The limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor can be calculated as 0.133&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Thus this material represents the first MOF to achieve visual detection of trace benzene vapor by the naked eyes. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure reveal that the special &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions between the host and guest, which facilitate electron transfer and greatly enhance the intensity of fluorescence.

Herein, we report a new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that exhibits interesting pore-opening behavior after immersing in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The pore-opening phase shows significant (&#8776;116 folds) and extremely fast (&amp;lt;1&#8197;minute) fluorescence enhancement after being exposed to saturated benzene vapor. The limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor can be calculated as 0.133&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus this material represents the first MOF to achieve visual detection of trace benzene vapor by the naked eyes. Theoretical calculations and single-crystal structure reveal that the special &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions between the host and guest, which facilitate electron transfer and greatly enhance the intensity of fluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinitiated Energy Transfer in Porous&#8208;Cage&#8208;Stabilised Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new material containing plasmonic silver nanoparticles was synthesized using only porphyrin&#8208;based porous organic cages as the ligand, which decorate the surface of the nanoparticle. The nanoparticle acts as a photosensitizer for the porphyrin cages by transferring its excited&#8208;state energy to the porphyrin. The photosensitization effect and porosity of the ligand enable superior photoelectrochemical water splitting compared to the individual components.







Abstract
We report a new composite material consisting of silver nanoparticles decorated with three&#8208;dimensional molecular organic cages based on light&#8208;absorbing porphyrins. The porphyrin cages serve to both stabilize the particles and allow diffusion and trapping of small molecules close to the metallic surface. Combining these two photoactive components results in a Fano&#8208;resonant interaction between the porphyrin Soret band and the nanoparticle&#8208;localised surface&#8208;plasmon resonance. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy revealed the silver nanoparticles transfer up to 37&#8201;% of their excited&#8208;state energy to the stabilising layer of porphyrin cages. These unusual photophysics cause a 2&#8208;fold current increase in photoelectrochemical water&#8208;splitting measurements. The composite structure provides a compelling proof of concept for advanced photosensitiser systems with intrinsic porosity for photocatalytic and sensing applications.

         <title>Linker Vacancy Engineering of a Robust ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;MOF for Hexane Isomers Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly robust ftw&#8208;type zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework has been constructed. Its linker vacancy sites are restored by post&#8208;synthetic linker insertion, which notably enhances its separation performance toward alkane isomers.







Abstract
Discrimination of physically similar molecules by porous solids represents an important yet challenging task in industrially relevant chemical separations. Precisely controlled pore dimension and/or tailored pore surface functionality are crucial to achieve high&#8208;efficiency separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for these challenging separations in light of their structural diversity as well as highly adjustable pore dimension/functionality. We report here a microporous, ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;based MOF structure, HIAM&#8208;410 (HIAM=Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials), built on hexanuclear Zr6 cluster and pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetracarboxylate (ptc4&#8722;). Its crystallographic structure has been determined using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique combined with Rietveld refinement against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, aided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. The compound features exceptional framework stability that is comparable to the prototype MOF UiO&#8208;66. Interestingly, the linker vacancies in the pristine MOF structure could be partially restored by post&#8208;synthetic linker insertion. Its separation capability of hexane isomers is enhanced substantially upon the linker vacancy engineering. The restored structure exhibits efficient splitting of monobranched and dibranched hexane isomers at both room temperature and industrially relevant temperature.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Polyhydroxylated Steroids by an Unsaturation&#8208;Functionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin were achieved from a key unsaturated steroidal skeleton in 14 and 15&#8197;steps overall, respectively, by employing an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy. The key unsaturated intermediate bearing a C19&#8208;hydroxy functionality was furnished in only four steps from a Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal through an efficient asymmetric dearomative cyclization reaction.







Abstract
Highly oxygenated cardiotonic steroids, such as ouabain, possess a wide spectrum of biological functions and remain significant synthetic challenges. Herein, we have applied an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy and developed a synthetic method in addressing the C19&#8208;hydroxylation issue for efficient synthesis of polyhydroxylated steroids. An effective asymmetric dearomative cyclization allowed the construction of the C19&#8208;hydroxy unsaturated steroidal skeleton in only four steps from the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal 7. The synthetic sequence featured C3&#8722;OH&#8208;directed hydrogenation/epoxidation, m&#8208;CPBA&#8208;triggered epoxidation/SN2&#8242; nucleophilic substitution, Birch reduction of an enone, and regioselective LiAlH4 reduction to furnish the polyhydroxy functionalities on the steroid skeleton with high stereochemical control and efficiency. This approach ultimately enabled the total synthesis of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin in 18 and 19 steps, respectively, overall. The synthesis of these polyhydroxylated steroids offers synthetic versatility and practicality in the search for new therapeutic agents.

         <title>Realizing Abundant Chirality Inversion of Supramolecular Nanohelices by Multiply Manipulating the Binding Sites in Molecular Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant chirality inversion has been realized by 1) manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives with different naphthalene derivatives (Mode&#8197;A or B), 2) synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives to simultaneously interact with two kinds of naphthalene derivatives (Mode&#8197;A+B), and 3) switching the interaction modes by varying solvent.







Abstract
The induction of diverse chirality regulation in nature by multiple binding sites of biomolecules is ubiquitous and plays an essential role in determining the biofunction of biosystems. However, mimicking this biological phenomenon and understanding at a molecular level its mechanism with the multiple binding sites by establishing an artificial system still remains a challenge. Herein, abundant chirality inversion is achieved by precisely and multiply manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives (D/LPPF) with different naphthalene derivatives (NA, NC, NP, NF). The amide and hydroxy group of naphthalene derivatives prefer to bind with the carboxy group of LPPF, while carboxylic groups and fluoride atoms tend to bind with the amide moiety of LPPF. All these diverse interaction modes can precisely trigger helicity inversion of LPPF nanofibers. In addition, synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites from a single LPPF molecule to simultaneously interact with different naphthalene derivatives leads to chirality regulation. Typically, varying the solvent may switch the interaction modes and the switched new interaction modes can be employed to further regulate the chirality of the LPPF nanofibers. This study may provide a novel approach to explore chirality diversity in artificial systems by regulating the intermolecular binding sites.

The selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property with high transparency in visible region makes the polymer suitable for transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass.







Abstract
Since the breakthrough of conductive polymers in 1977, scientists have made great efforts to create small band gap (Eg) conjugated polymers. Two general strategies to design small Eg conjugated polymers are quinoid structure and donor&#8208;acceptor structure. Ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers (Eg&lt;1.0&#8197;eV) always suffer from poor air stability because of high&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels. In this work, we report a new strategy to design ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers by N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). The resulting polymer exhibits an Eg of 0.82&#8197;eV and an onset absorption wavelength of &gt;1500&#8197;nm. Moreover, the polymer exhibits excellent air stability because of its low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. An unprecedented property of this polymer is the selective light absorption in the infrared range (800&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) and high transparency in the visible range (400&#8211;780&#8197;nm). Using this property, for the first time, we demonstrate the application of conjugated polymers as transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass, which reduces indoor solar irradiation through window and consequently reduces power consumption for cooling of buildings and cars in summer.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodynamic Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Therapy and Metastasis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared photodynamic chemiluminescent probe (DBPOL) is designed to specifically detect the tumor biomarker lysyl oxidase (LOX) for chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) and follow&#8208;up monitoring of lung metastasis.







Abstract
There is growing interest in the development of chemiluminescence (CL) probes for phototheranostics because of their minimized tissue autofluorescence. However, due to a lack of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing chemiluminophores, current probes for NIR CL&#8208;guided phototherapy are based on nanoparticles made up of multiple components. We report bright unimolecular chemiluminophores with NIR absorptions and emissions, long CL half&#8208;lives and ideal photodynamic efficiency. One luminophore is modified into an activatable probe, DBPOL, with a turn&#8208;on CL signal and photodynamic activity that are specific to a cancer biomarker. The highly sensitive DBPOL allows CL&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy which completely inhibits tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse models, and can be applied for noninvasive monitoring of lung metastasis. We provide molecular guidelines for NIR&#8208;absorbing CL probes for imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy.

         <title>Shape&#8208; and Size&#8208;Tunable Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have established the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull internal alkynes. This reaction allows for the shape&#8208; and size&#8208;tunable synthesis of covalent organic cages (aryl ether cages) using push&#8208;pull internal diynes. Some aryl ether cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in their hydrophobic cavity by hydrogen bonding with the multiple ester moieties.







Abstract
Covalent organic cages have potential applications in molecular inclusion/recognition and porous organic crystals. Bridging arene units with sp3 atoms enables facile construction of rigid isolated internal vacancies, and various prismatic arene cages have been synthesized by kinetically controlled covalent bond formation. However, the synthesis of a tetrahedral one, which requires twice as much bond formation as prismatic ones, has been limited to a thermodynamically controlled dynamic SNAr reaction, and this reversible covalent bond formation made the resulting cage product chemically unstable. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective room temperature [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull alkynes and its application to the synthesis of chemically stable aryl ether cages of various shapes and sizes, including prismatic and tetrahedral forms. These aryl ether cages are highly crystalline and intertwine with each other to form regular packing structures. Some aryl ether cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in their hydrophobic cavity by hydrogen bonding with the multiple ester moieties.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;phase WO3 Cocatalysts on Hierarchical Si&#8208;based Photocathode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Li Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical silicon&#8208;based photocathodes with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide cocatalysts achieve a highly efficient yield rate of metallic lithium and an excellent faradaic efficiency. This work provides a new strategy for the green extraction of waste lithium and the utilization of solar energy.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical lithium (Li) extraction can be expected to provide a useful recycle of Li+ from waste Li&#8208;containing battery, but the process is limited by the photocathodes with poor Li+ absorption and low yield rate. Here, we have designed a hierarchical silicon (Si)&#8208;based photocathode with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide (WO3) cocatalysts for photoelectrochemical Li extraction under 1 sun illumination, achieving a high Li yield rate of &#8776;223.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 91.9&#8201;% at 0.0817&#8197;V versus Li0/+ redox couple. The WO3 cocatalysts with the mixture of amorphous and crystalline phase accelerates the Li+ insertion and precipitation and enriches the concentration of Li+ at the photocathode surface. This robust photoelectrochemical Li extraction system provides a new insight on designing green and efficient route for cyclic utilization of Li resources in the sustainable energy field.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt Nanoparticles: Phase&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Performance in Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered mesoporous intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles, including Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic phase and Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic phase, were successfully synthesized by a concurrent template method in presence of different Ga sources. The resulting mesoporous intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt disclosed remarkably phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction electrocatalysis, with unexpected high activity of Ga1Pt1 compared to the Ga3Pt5 counterpart.







Abstract
The intermetallic phase control is a promising strategy to optimize the physicochemical properties of ordered intermetallic compounds and engineer their performance in various (electro)catalytic reactions. However, the intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance is still rarely reported because of the difficulty in synthesizing ordered intermetallics with precisely controlled phase structures at atomic level, especially having ordered mesoscopic structure/morphology. Here, we successfully reported a precise synthesis of two phase&#8208;pure mesoporous intermetallic gallium&#8208;platinum (meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt) nanoparticles, including meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic space group and meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic space group. The intermetallic phase control of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles was realized by carefully tuning the induced Ga salts with different anions that optimized the free energies during the synthesis. The intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt was systematically evaluated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis, with completely opposite catalytic performance in alkaline media. Interestingly, ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 catalyst with chiral atomic arrangements disclosed unexpected high ORR activity and stability with 5.9 and 3.2 enhancement factors in mass activity compared to those of meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 and commercial Pt/C.

Here, we successfully reported a precise synthesis of two phase-pure mesoporous intermetallic gallium-platinum (&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga-Pt) nanoparticles, including &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with an orthorhombic space group and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with a non-symmorphic chiral cubic space group. The intermetallic phase control of ordered &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga-Pt nanoparticles was realized by carefully tuning the induced Ga salts with different anions that optimized the free energies during the synthesis. The intermetallic phase-dependent catalytic performance of ordered &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga-Pt was systematically evaluated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis, with completely opposite catalytic performance in alkaline media. Interestingly, ordered &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with chiral atomic arrangements disclosed unexpected high ORR activity and stability with 5.9 and 3.2 enhancement factors in mass activity compared to those of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and commercial Pt/C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting Reusable Edge&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Free Polyphthalocyanine Networks for Efficient Polymer Synthesis at Near Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screening of various edge&#8208;functionalities, naphthyl&#8208;edged polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc&#8208;n) are discovered with promising catalytic performance to promote efficient polymer synthesis. The metal&#8208;free PPc&#8208;n is suitable for rapid and controlled photopolymerization of various monomers under NIR light irradiation with high monomer conversions and excellent recyclable stability.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are highly advantageous for industrial applications owing to their distinctive merits including easy separation and effective recovery. However, utilizing heterogeneous photocatalysts to harness longer wavelength light remains a critical area of research. This contribution explores the use of edge&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc&#8208;x) to promote efficient polymer synthesis under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Our screening process revealed that both phenyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;p) and naphthyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;n) offer promising performance for photopolymerization. With the assistance of ppm&#8208;level PPc&#8208;n catalyst, well&#8208;defined polymers were synthesized within a few hours under the regulation of three NIR lights, regardless of shielded by synthetic and biological barriers. An excellent control over the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution was achieved. Furthermore, PPc&#8208;x can be easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles, with negligible leaching and maintenance of the catalytic performance. This study expands a new avenue in developing versatile photocatalysts for the modern synthetic toolkits and offer benefits in diverse applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Unactivated Alkenes via Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Regioselective Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective catalysis using a chiral nickel complex has been developed via kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes. This hydroamination protocol produces a wide range of syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives derivatives and &#945;&#8208;alkylated unconjugated carbonyl olefins with high enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution is a powerful strategy for the isolation of enantioenriched compounds from racemic mixtures, and the development of selective catalytic processes is an active area of research. Here, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes via the enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselective hydroamination. This protocol affords both chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted butenamides and syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantiomeric purity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and selectivity factor up to &gt;684. The key to the excellent kinetic resolution efficiency is the distinctive architecture of the chiral nickel complex, which enables successful resolution and enantioselective C&#8722;N bond construction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the unique structure of the chiral ligand facilitates a rapid migratory insertion step with one enantiomer. This strategy provides a practical and versatile approach to prepare a wide range of chiral compounds.

         <title>DOPA Residues Endow Collagen with Radical Scavenging Capacity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bound dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is a component of tendon and meniscus tissue and originates from tyrosine oxidation. Both in situ and in vitro, DOPA proved to be a highly efficient radical scavenger, with the products of radical degradation being hydrogen peroxide and DOPA quinone. Thus, we suggest that the DOPA pathway is part of a tissue&#8208;inherent redox buffer system.







Abstract
Here we uncover collagen, the main structural protein of all connective tissues, as a redox&#8208;active material. We identify dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues, post&#8208;translational oxidation products of tyrosine residues, to be common in collagen derived from different connective tissues. We observe that these DOPA residues endow collagen with substantial radical scavenging capacity. When reducing radicals, DOPA residues work as redox relay: they convert to the quinone and generate hydrogen peroxide. In this dual function, DOPA outcompetes its amino acid precursors and ascorbic acid. Our results establish DOPA residues as redox&#8208;active side chains of collagens, probably protecting connective tissues against radicals formed under mechanical stress and/or inflammation.

         <title>Multi&#8208;layer 3D Chirality and Double&#8208;Helical Assembly in a Copper Nanocluster with a Triple&#8208;Helical Cu15 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;precise copper nanocluster containing a chiral triple&#8208;stranded helical core has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The nanocluster shows unique multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality and assembles into double&#8208;helical secondary structure with emergent distinct optical and catalytic properties.







Abstract
Conceptually mimicking biomolecules&#8217; ability to construct multiple&#8208;helical aggregates with emergent properties and functions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we report an atom&#8208;precise 18&#8208;copper nanocluster (NC), Cu18H(PET)14(TPP)6(NCS)3 (Cu18H) which contains a pseudo D3&#8208;symmetrical triple&#8208;helical Cu15 core. Structurally, Cu18H may be also viewed as sandwich type of sulfur&#8208;bridged chiral copper cluster units [Cu6&#8722;Cu6&#8722;Cu6], endowing three&#8208;layered 3D chirality. More importantly, the chiral NCs are aggregated into an infinite double&#8208;stranded helix supported by intra&#8208;strand homonuclear C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C dihydrogen contacts and inter&#8208;strand C&#8722;H/&#960; and C&#8722;H/S interactions. The unique multi&#8208;layered 3D chirality and the double&#8208;helical assembly of Cu18H are evocative of DNA. Moreover, the collective behaviours of the aggregated NCs not only exhibit crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effects in the deep&#8208;red region, but also efficiently catalyze electron transfer (ET) reaction. This study thus presents that hierarchical assemblies of atomically defined copper NCs could be intricate as observed for important biomolecules like DNA with emergent properties arising from aggregated behaviours.

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by 760 nm NIR light via single&#8208;photon pathway is reported by Xuezhao Li, Wen Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218768). The photocage was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers, forming nanoparticles via self&#8208;assembly, which release the ruthenium complex&#8208;based photocages to inhibit tumor proliferation in vivo upon exposure to NIR light.

         <title>Cover Picture: Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Biomolecules with Carbon Nanotubes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 24/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence lifetime imaging is a powerful technique. In their Research Article (e202300682), Sebastian Kruss et&#8197;al. used single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as fluorescent probes/sensors for biomolecules in the near infrared (NIR) tissue transparency window. The SWCNTs were functionalized with DNA to render them selective for the important neurotransmitter dopamine. Time correlated single photon counting in a confocal microscope was used to read out fluorescence lifetime, which changed with dopamine concentration. This approach enabled the measurement of dopamine around cells. Thus, the fluorescence lifetime of SWCNTs becomes a new sensing strategy for bio(molecules).

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>

Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers successfully implemented the key features of the natural enzyme CO dehydrogenase in an iron porphyrin architecture and designed a catalyst that allowed facile and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 products is challenging, as the thermodynamic reduction potentials for the different n&#8201;e&#8722;/n&#8201;H+ reductions of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers have taken inspiration from the active site of nickel CO dehydrogenase (Ni&#8208;CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by a urea moiety. These complexes show fast and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and the results suggest a Ni&#8208;CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metals binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilizes the reduced species by forming a bridged complex, facilitating the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free NiOx Nanocrystals: A Low&#8208;cost and Stable Hole Transport Material for Commercializing Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dopant&#8208;free non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective hole transport material in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, Zhang et&#8197;al. summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs and their applications in different perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Advancing inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for commercial applications given their compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem photovoltaics, low&#8208;temperature processability (&#8804;100&#8201;&#176;C), and promising operational stability. Although inverted PSCs have achieved an efficiency of over 25&#8201;% using doped or expensive organic hole transport materials (HTMs), their synthesis cost and stability still cannot meet the requirements for their commercialization. Recently, dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective HTM in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, we summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs. Then, the applications of NiOx NCs in other perovskite optoelectronics beyond photovoltaics are discussed. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future development of NiOx NCs for the commercialization of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions through Sulfur&#8208;Anchoring of Metal Catalysts on Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomena, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI phenomena made it possible to synthesize a variety of catalysts with enhanced performance.







Abstract
In supported metal catalysts, the supports would strongly interact with the metal components instead of just acting as a carrier, which greatly affects both of their synthesis and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Carbon is considered as very important but inert support and thus hard to induce strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI between metal and sulfur&#8208;doped carbon (S&#8722;C) supports enables the catalysts with extraordinary resistance to sintering at high temperatures of up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, which allows the general synthesis of single&#8208;atom, alloy cluster, and intermetallic compound catalysts with high dispersion and metal loading for a variety of applications.

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, there still lacks an evaluation criterion to estimate real research status and compare overall performance of the developed SSLMBs. Herein, we propose a comprehensive descriptor, Li+ transport throughput (

On this basis, we evaluate the 
 of liquid, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state batteries, and highlight three key aspects to achieve high value of 
 via building highly efficient cross&#8208;phase, cross&#8208;gap and cross&#8208;interface ion transport in the solid&#8208;state battery systems. We believe that the new concept of

         <title>Charge Makes a Difference: Molecular Ionic Bismuth Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged molecular bismuth species encompass cationic and anionic complexes with organic and inorganic ligand spheres as well as ligand&#8208;free molecular clusters. This review provides an overview of their syntheses, structures, and bonding modes. It outlines how the heavy metal bismuth, with its capability of forming non&#8208;toxic compounds, can be understood as the key towards unique reactivity and sustainable applications.







Abstract
Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8722;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8722;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non&#8208;precious (semi&#8722;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when charged compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8722;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8722;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non-precious (semi&#8722;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when &lt;i&gt;charged&lt;/i&gt; compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition/enantioselective protonation with selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides is disclosed, which affords a series of chiral selenides in high to excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition/protonation with selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides is disclosed, which affords a series of chiral selenides in high to excellent enantioselectivity. As for both selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, the reaction enjoys broad substrate scopes. The present catalytic system is also successfully applied to asymmetric selenation of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. A [Cu&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;TANIAPHOS]&#8208;SePh species is characterized by its 77Se NMR spectra, which gives a chemical shift at &#948; 462&#8197;ppm. Moreover, a {[Cu&#8208;(R)&#8208;TOL&#8208;BINAP]&#8208;SePh}2 species is characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, which confirms the formation of Cu&#8722;Se bond in the reaction. Finally, the transformations of the thioamide group to amine and thioester are demonstrated to be straightforward.

         <title>Nanobody Loop Mimetics Enhance Son of Sevenless 1&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleotide Exchange on RAS
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides based on the interacting loop of a nanobody were designed as downsized mimetics, by considering interactions with the RAS&#8201;:&#8201;son of sevenless&#8197;1 (SOS1) protein complex observed in their co&#8208;crystal structure. A biochemical assay, flanked by X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures and kinetic studies, demonstrated the modulation of nucleotide exchange activity of the RAS&#8201;:&#8201;SOS1 complex, together with high structural mimicry of the nanobody paratope.







Abstract
RAS proteins control various intracellular signaling networks. Mutations at specific locations were shown to stabilize their active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)&#8208;bound state, which is associated with the development of multiple cancers. An attractive approach to modulate RAS signaling is through its regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). With the recent discovery of Nanobody14 (Nb14), which potently enhances SOS1&#8208;catalyzed nucleotide exchange on RAS, we explored the feasibility of developing peptide mimetics by structurally mimicking the complementarity&#8208;determining region&#8197;3 (CDR3). Guided by a biochemical GEF assay and X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures, successive rounds of optimization and gradual conformational rigidification led to CDR3 mimetics showing half of the maximal activation potential of Nb14 with an EC50 value of 29&#8197;&#956;M. Altogether, this study demonstrated that peptides able to modulate a protein&#8208;protein interaction can be obtained by structural mimicry of a Nb paratope.

         <title>Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) formed a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure by sequential synthesis of a metal organic framework (MOF) on the surface of CNCs then a microporous organic polymer (MOP) on the surface of ZIF@CNC composites. The CNC materials functionalized with MOPs and ZIF&#8208;8 showed excellent catalytic performance in CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals were uniformly grown on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to give a hybrid material, ZIF@CNCs. By varying the stoichiometry of the components, it was possible to control the size of the ZIF&#8208;8 crystals grown on the CNC surface. Optimized ZIF@CNC (ZIF@CNC&#8208;2) was used as a template to synthesize a microporous organic polymer (MOP), ZIF@MOP@CNC. After etching the ZIF&#8208;8 with 6&#8197;M HCl solution, a MOP material with encapsulated CNCs (MOP@CNC) was formed. Zinc coordination into the porphyrin unit of the MOP yielded the ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure, Zn MOP@CNC, comprised of CNCs encapsulated within the Zn&#8208;MOP. In comparison to ZIF@CNC&#8208;2, Zn MOP@CNC showed better catalytic activity and chemical stability for CO2 fixation, converting epichlorohydrin to chloroethylene carbonate. This work demonstrates a novel approach to create porous materials through CNC templating.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Exchange by Homogeneous Iridium Catalysis in Aqueous Buffers with Deuterium or Tritium Gas</title>

Directed, highly selective, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in water or buffers is a new powerful tool for deuterium or tritium labelling of highly polar compounds and aqueous formulated targets.







Abstract
We have studied the highly selective homogeneous iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with deuterium or tritium gas as an isotope source in water and buffers. With an improved water&#8208;soluble Kerr&#8208;type catalyst, we have achieved the first insight into applying HIE reactions in aqueous media with varying pH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations gave consistent insights in the calculated energies of transition states and coordination complexes, further explaining the observed reactivity and guidance on the scope and limitations for HIE reactions in water. Finally, we successfully adapted these findings to tritium chemistry.

         <title>Supercooled Liquids with Dynamic Room Temperature Phosphorescence Using Terminal Hydroxyl Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise strategy to develop a series of stable supercooled liquids (SCLs) is presented. The SCLs exhibit repeatable dynamic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence behavior by alternating stimulation with UV light and heat. This unique luminescence behavior is applied to demonstrate erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates.







Abstract
Dynamic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics, which inevitably suffer from poor processability, flexibility or stretchability. Herein, we report a concise strategy to develop supercooled liquids (SCLs) with dynamic RTP behavior using terminal hydroxyl engineering. The terminal hydroxyls effectively hinder the nucleation process of molecules for the formation of stable SCLs after thermal annealing. Impressively, the SCLs show reversible RTP emission via alternant stimulation by UV light and heat. Photoactivated SCLs have phosphorescent efficiency of 8.50&#8201;% and a lifetime of 31.54&#8197;ms under ambient conditions. Regarding the dynamic RTP behavior and stretchability of SCLs, we demonstrate the applications in erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates.

     alt="Supercooled Liquids with Dynamic Room Temperature Phosphorescence Using Terminal Hydroxyl Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concise strategy to develop a series of stable supercooled liquids (SCLs) is presented. The SCLs exhibit repeatable dynamic room-temperature phosphorescence behavior by alternating stimulation with UV light and heat. This unique luminescence behavior is applied to demonstrate erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics, which inevitably suffer from poor processability, flexibility or stretchability. Herein, we report a concise strategy to develop supercooled liquids (SCLs) with dynamic RTP behavior using terminal hydroxyl engineering. The terminal hydroxyls effectively hinder the nucleation process of molecules for the formation of stable SCLs after thermal annealing. Impressively, the SCLs show reversible RTP emission via alternant stimulation by UV light and heat. Photoactivated SCLs have phosphorescent efficiency of 8.50&#8201;% and a lifetime of 31.54&#8197;ms under ambient conditions. Regarding the dynamic RTP behavior and stretchability of SCLs, we demonstrate the applications in erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates. This finding provides a design principle for obtaining SCLs with RTP and expands the potential applications of RTP materials in flexible optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manganese(I) Catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H Allylation of Benzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple manganese catalyst sets new standards in the ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation of benzoates, by allowing nearly complete selectivity for mono&#8208; over competing di&#8208;allylation. The reaction can be combined with an in situ decarboxylation, giving access to allylarenes in substitution patterns that are otherwise hard to obtain. The scope of the protocol is demonstrated by 44 diverse examples.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;metal catalyst Mn(CO)5Br was found to efficiently promote ortho C&#8722;H allylations of arenecarboxylates in the presence of neocuproine as the ligand. Despite the simplicity of directing group and catalyst system, the selectivity goes well beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in that mono&#8208;allylated products are obtained exclusively with high selectivities for the least hindered ortho&#8208;position. The directing group can optionally be removed by in situ decarboxylation, opening up a regioselective entry to allyl arenes. The preparative utility of the process and its othogonality to other approaches was demonstrated by 44 products with otherwise hard&#8208;to&#8208;access substitution patterns, including 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;allylbenzene, 3&#8208;allylbenzofuran, or 5&#8208;allyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylnitrobenzene.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed and biomimetic cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl terpenols as a platform strategy for the synthesis of &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinoids is described. This synthesis features the most direct synthetic access to this product class and requires only 3 steps from readily available precursors with exceptionally low catalyst loadings of as low as 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% (MOM=methoxymethyl, IDPi=imidodiphosphorimidates).







Abstract
We report herein the catalytic asymmetric cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl terpenols to afford enantiomerically highly enriched &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinoid scaffolds in a single step. As powerful chiral catalysts strongly acidic imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPis) have been identified which furnish the products with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Upon MOM&#8208;deprotection some naturally occurring cannabimimetica such as (&#8722;)&#8208;cis&#8208;&#916;9&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol and (&#8722;)&#8208;perrottetinene as well as some unnatural analogues were made accessible along a merely 3&#8208;step biomimetic sequence (MOM=methoxymethyl).

         <title>Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Selective Oxidation of Silanes to Silanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) efficiently hydroxylates organosilanes to the corresponding silanols. The methodology proposed here excels by its simplicity and high productivity. Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (PELE) simulations provide a rationale for the selectivities observed and put the basis for future AaeUPO engineering.







Abstract
A peroxygenase&#8208;catalysed hydroxylation of organosilanes is reported. The recombinant peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) enabled efficient conversion of a broad range of silane starting materials in attractive productivities (up to 300&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), catalyst performance (up to 84&#8197;s&#8722;1 and more than 120&#8201;000 catalytic turnovers). Molecular modelling of the enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction puts a basis for the mechanistic understanding of AaeUPO selectivity.

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed SNAr hexafluoroisopropoxylation of unactivated aryl chlorides and bromides was demonstrated. The catalyst activates the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating the attack by weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol. Given that fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules, this method might find utility in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in pharmaceuticals because compounds with these motifs are more metabolically stable and more lipophilic than their nonfluorinated analogues. However, hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers have not been extensively studied, presumably because of the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we describe a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution of aryl chlorides or bromides, which act as the limiting reagents, with weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol under mild reaction conditions. This method provides diverse hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers. We demonstrated the generality of this method by carrying out reactions of a large array of unactivated aryl halides, and we found that the success of the reactions relied on arene activation by means of &#951;6&#8208;coordination.

         <title>Selective In Situ Analysis of Mature microRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles Using a DNA Cage&#8208;Based Thermophoretic Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging cancer biomarkers. Here we devised a DNA cage&#8208;based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs. This assay reached a limit of detection of 2.05&#8197;fM for mature miRNAs in EVs without the interference of pre&#8208;miRNAs, and an overall accuracy of 90&#8201;% for discriminating breast cancer patients and healthy donors.







Abstract
Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in different stages of cancer progression, yet it remains challenging to precisely detect mature miRNAs in EVs due to the presence of interfering RNAs (such as longer precursor miRNAs, pre&#8208;miRNAs) and the low abundance of tumor&#8208;associated miRNAs. By leveraging the size&#8208;selective ability of DNA cages and polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs, we devised a DNA cage&#8208;based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs with a low limit of detection (LoD) of 2.05&#8197;fM. Our assay can profile EV mature miRNAs directly in serum samples without the interference of pre&#8208;miRNAs and the need for ultracentrifugation. A clinical study showed that EV miR&#8208;21 or miR&#8208;155 had an overall accuracy of 90&#8201;% for discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy donors, which outperformed conventional molecular probes detecting both mature miRNAs and pre&#8208;miRNAs. We envision that our assay can advance EV miRNA&#8208;based diagnosis of cancer.

&lt;p&gt;Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging cancer biomarkers. Here we devised a DNA cage-based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs. This assay reached a limit of detection of 2.05&#8197;fM for mature miRNAs in EVs without the interference of pre-miRNAs, and an overall accuracy of 90&#8201;% for discriminating breast cancer patients and healthy donors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in different stages of cancer progression, yet it remains challenging to precisely detect mature miRNAs in EVs due to the presence of interfering RNAs (such as longer precursor miRNAs, pre-miRNAs) and the low abundance of tumor-associated miRNAs. By leveraging the size-selective ability of DNA cages and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs, we devised a DNA cage-based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs with a low limit of detection (LoD) of 2.05&#8197;fM. Our assay can profile EV mature miRNAs directly in serum samples without the interference of pre-miRNAs and the need for ultracentrifugation. A clinical study showed that EV miR-21 or miR-155 had an overall accuracy of 90&#8201;% for discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy donors, which outperformed conventional molecular probes detecting both mature miRNAs and pre-miRNAs. We envision that our assay can advance EV miRNA-based diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Formyl Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free protocol for the coupling reaction of aldehydes and alkyl halides was successfully developed with mesoionic carbenes (MICs) as catalysts. This versatile strategy delivers a large diversity of simple ketones as well as bio&#8208;active molecules by late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Ketones are among the most useful functional groups in organic synthesis, and they are commonly encountered in a broad range of compounds with various applications. Herein, we describe the mesoionic carbene&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of aldehydes with non&#8208;activated secondary and even primary alkyl halides. This metal&#8208;free method utilizes deprotonated Breslow intermediates derived from mesoionic carbenes (MICs), which act as super electron donors and induce the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkyl halides. This mild coupling reaction has a broad substrate scope and tolerates many functional groups, which allows to prepare a diversity of simple ketones as well as bio&#8208;active molecules by late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Efficient Transformation of Polymer Main Chain Catalyzed by Macrocycle Metal Complexes via Pseudorotaxane Intermediate</title>

Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effect. Here, we show macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient transformation of main chain in polymer substrate, whereby higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Mechanistic studies suggest the reactions proceed via the formation of a pseudorotaxane intermediate.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effects. Developing efficient polymer reactions in artificial systems thus represents a long&#8208;standing objective in the fields of polymer and material science. Here, we show unprecedented macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient polymer reaction that result in 100&#8201;% transformation of the main chain functional groups presumably via a processive mode reaction. The complete polymer reactions were confirmed in not only intramolecular reaction (hydroamination) but also intermolecular reaction (hydrosilylation) by using Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;catalyzed systems. The most fascinating feature of the both reactions is that higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Various studies suggested that the reactions occur in the catalyst cavity via the formation of a supramolecular complex between the macrocycle catalyst and polymer substrate like pseudorotaxane, which should be of characteristic of the efficient polymer reactions progressing in a processive mode.

         <title>Combining MN6 Octahedra and PN5 Trigonal Bipyramids in the Mica&#8208;like Nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M=Al, In)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered silicate minerals are extremely versatile. The mica&#8208;like nitrides MP6N11 (M=Al, In) presented herein, containing the rare structural motifs of PN5 trigonal pyramids and MN6 octahedra, expand the sparse topic of nitridic layered silicate analogues. This opens a new field of research mimicking natural abundant minerals, promising a vast amount of new nitrides with intriguing materials properties.







Abstract
Layered silicates are a very versatile class of materials with high importance to humanity. The new nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M=Al, In), synthesized from MCl3, P3N5 and NH4N3 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 1100&#8201;&#176;C and 8&#8197;GPa, show a mica&#8208;like layer setup and feature rare nitrogen coordination motifs. The crystal structure of AlP6N11 was elucidated from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group Cm (no. 8), a=4.9354(10), b=8.1608(16), c=9.0401(18)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=98.63(3)&#176;), enabling Rietveld refinement of isotypic InP6N11. It is built up from layers of PN4 tetrahedra, PN5 trigonal bipyramids and MN6 octahedra. PN5 trigonal bipyramids have been reported only once and MN6 octahedra are sparsely found in the literature. AlP6N11 was further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX), IR and NMR spectroscopy. Despite the vast amount of known layered silicates, there is no isostructural compound to MP6N11 as yet.

         <title>Braided Fiber Current Collectors for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;channel fiber current collector with both high electrical conductivity and loading content of active materials has been designed to produce fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy densities.







Abstract
Fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising power strategy for the rising wearable electronics. However, most fiber current collectors are solid with vastly increased weights of inactive materials and sluggish charge transport, thus resulting in low energy densities which have hindered the development of fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries in the past decade. Here, a braided fiber current collector with multiple channels was prepared by multi&#8208;axial winding method to not only increase the mass fraction of active materials, but also to promote ion transport along fiber electrodes. In comparison to typical solid copper wires, the braided fiber current collector hosted 139&#8201;% graphite with only 1/3 mass. The fiber graphite anode with braided current collector delivered high specific capacity of 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the overall electrode weight, which was 2 times higher than that of its counterpart solid copper wire. The resulting fiber battery showed high energy density of 62&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of Cleavable Polymers via Oxidation of Thioether Moieties and Thiol Click Reactions: A Click&#8208;Declick Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Block copolymers and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by click reactions. The polymer chains are cleaved by declick reactions between the oxidized thioethers on the polymer structures and the added thiol compounds.







Abstract
In the past decades click chemistries including thiol chemistries have found wide applications in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers. In this research, a click&#8208;declick strategy based on the oxidation of heteroaromatic thioethers and the substitution reactions between the oxidized groups and thiols, is proposed for the synthesis of the cleavable polymers. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, block copolymers (BCPs) and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by thiol&#8208;phenylsulfone substitution reactions, and heteroaromatic thioethers are produced at the junction points of the BCP chains or on the crosslinking sites of the star&#8208;like polymer. The thioethers can be oxidized to heteroaromatic sulfoxides or sulfones, depending on the oxidization condition. It is demonstrated that both sulfoxides or sulfones can have base catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reactions with thiols, leading to the cleavage of the polymers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lucidumone through Convenient One&#8208;pot Preparation of the Tetracyclic Skeleton by Claisen Rearrangement and Subsequent Intramolecular Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy for the synthesis of lucidumone is described. Key transformation is a one&#8208;pot construction of a complex tetracyclic skeleton using a sequential Claisen rearrangement and an intramolecular aldol reaction. Other key features are stereocontrolled manipulations of functional groups on the bicyclo structure and efficient ether cyclization. An enantioselective synthesis is also described via a chiral transfer strategy in the Claisen rearrangement.







Abstract
The total synthesis of lucidumone (1), a Ganoderma meroterpenoid, was accomplished in racemic form from easily prepared 6 and 7 in 10 steps as the longest linear sequence. The synthesis was completed through one&#8208;pot preparation of the tetracyclic core skeleton by Claisen rearrangement followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction. The intramolecular aldol reaction allowed for the stereocontrolled construction of the bicyclo [2.2.2] octane skeleton fused to an indanone structure. The enantioselective total synthesis of 1 was also described via a chiral transfer strategy in the Claisen rearrangement.

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Potential&#8208;Driven Dissociation of N&#8208;Heterocycle/BF3 Adducts: A Possible Manifestation of the Electro&#8208;Inductive Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a non&#8208;redox fashion, applied potential dissociates acid&#8208;base N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 couples in the diffusion layer near an electrode. This effect was probed using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Recently, non&#8208;Faradaic effects were used to modify the electronic structure and reactivity of electrode&#8208;bound species. We hypothesize that these electrostatic perturbations could influence the chemical reactivity of electrolyte species near an electrode in the absence of Faradaic electron transfer. A prime example of non&#8208;Faradaic effects is acid&#8208;base dissociation near an interface. Here, we probed the near&#8208;electrode dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 Lewis adducts upon electrode polarization, well outside of the redox potential window of the adducts. Using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, we detected a potential&#8208;dependent depletion of the adduct near the electrode. We propose an electro&#8208;inductive effect where a more positive potential leads to electron withdrawal on the N&#8208;heterocycle. This study takes a step forward in the use of electrostatics at electrochemical interfaces for field&#8208;driven electrocatalytic and electro&#8208;synthetic processes.

         <title>Cooperative Sensitization Upconversion in Solution Dispersions of Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies of Mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion from Eu3+ in non&#8208;deuterated solution dispersions. Upconversion quantum yields of 0.67&#8201;% were obtained under 980&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Lanthanide upconversion luminescence in nanoparticles has prompted continuous breakthroughs in information storage, temperature sensing, and biomedical applications, among others. Achieving upconversion luminescence at the molecular scale is still a critical challenge in modern chemistry. In this work, we explored the upconversion luminescence of solution dispersions of co&#8208;crystals composed of discrete mononuclear Yb(DBM)3Bpy and Eu(DBM)3Bpy complexes (DBM: dibenzoylmethane, Bpy: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). The 613&#8197;nm emission of Eu3+ was observed under excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. From the series of molecular assemblies studied, the most intense luminescence was obtained for a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;Eu3+, resulting in a high quantum yield of 0.67&#8201;% at 2.1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The structure and energy transfer mechanism of the assemblies were fully characterized. This is the first example of an Eu3+&#8208;based upconverting system composed of two discrete mononuclear lanthanide complexes present as co&#8208;crystals in non&#8208;deuterated solution.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Catalysts from Melting Glass&#8208;Forming Cobalt&#8208;Based Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework for Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics and serious charge recombination restrict the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The advancement of novel metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving PEC water splitting performance. Herein, a MOF glass catalyst through melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62) was introduced on various metal oxide (MO: Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4) semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer, constructing the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. Owing to the excellent conductivity, stability and open active sites of MOF glass, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes exhibit a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity and stability in comparison to pristine MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and thus improve PEC performance. This MOF glass not only serves as an excellent OER cocatalyst on tunable photoelectrodes, but also enables promising opportunities for PEC devices for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Ketyl Radical Anion Mediated Radical Polymerization and Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Yielding Polymers with Low &#272;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel polymerization capable of yielding polymers with low molecular weight distribution (&#272;) is essential and significant in polymer chemistry, where monofunctional initiator contains only one initiation site in these polymerizations generally. Here, ketyl radical anion species is introduced to develop a novel Ketyl Mediated Polymerization (KMP), which enables radical polymerization at carbon radical site and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at oxygen anion site, respectively. Meanwhile, polymerization and corresponding organic synthesis generally couldn&#8217;t be performed simultaneously in one pot. Through KMP, organic synthesis and polymerization are achieved in one pot, where small molecules (cyclopentane derivates) and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild condition simultaneously. At the initiation step, both organic synthesis and polymerization are initiated by single electron transfer reaction with ketyl radical anion formation. Cyclopentane derivates are synthesized through 3&#8208;3 coupling reaction and cyclization. Polystyrene and polycaprolactone with low &#272; and a full monomer conversion are prepared by KMP via radical polymerization and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, respectively. This work therefore enables both organic synthesis and two different polymerizations from same initiation system, which saves time, labour, resource and energy and expands the reaction mode and method libraries of organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Modulation of an Unstable Dehydrosecodine&#8208;type Intermediate and Its Encapsulation into a Confined Cavity Enable Its X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Observation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous indole alkaloids such as the iboga&#8208; and aspidosperma&#8208;type are believed to be biosynthesized via a common hypothetical intermediate, dehydrosecodine. The highly reactive nature of dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compounds has hampered their isolation and structural elucidation. In this study, we achieved the first X&#8208;ray structural determination of a dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compound by integrating synthetic optimization of the reactivity and stabilizing the fragile molecule by encapsulation into a supramolecular host. Formation of a 1:1 complex of the dehydrosecodine&#8208;type labile guest bearing both vinyl indole and dihydropyridine units with the host was observed. This integrated approach not only provides insights into the biosynthetic conversions but also allows stabilization and storage of the reactive and otherwise short&#8208;lived intermediate within the confined hydrophobic cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Ensembles in Methane Dehydroaromatization over Molybdenum/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Identified by 2D 1H&#8208;95Mo Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) over Mo&#8208;modified zeolite is a potential catalytic route for converting natural gas into valuable aromatics. However, the active species in this reaction are highly complex, involving diverse Mo species, acidic sites of zeolite, and organic molecules. &#160;Herein, we apply 1D 95Mo NMR and 2D 1H&#8208;95Mo heteronuclear correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to directly observe the active ensembles in the confined channels of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite during the MDA reaction. We monitor the evolution of the spatial correlations of Mo species with the Br&#248;nsted acid sites and organic products (olefins and aromatics) in the zeolite channels. We identify two kinds of MoOxCy species, with the more carbidic one (MoOxCy&#8208;II) exhibiting higher activity for methane activation and benzene formation. The strong spatial interactions between the active Mo species and the organic species in the Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 pores are related to the MDA activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;Amino Allenoates Bearing a Vicinal All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenter with Dual&#8208;Copper&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletons of chiral tetrasubstituted allenes bearing a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter are of importance but still challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective &#947;&#8208;additions of 1&#8208;alkynyl ketimines with dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalysis under mild conditions, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino allenoates bearing a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr). Importantly, the stereodivergent synthesis of the products was realized by the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reaction and the Grignard reagent promoted epimerization. Moreover, the dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were smoothly applied to a gram&#8208;scale reaction and adopted to introduce chiral tetrasubstituted allenyl moieties into bioactive molecules. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were catalyzed by double chiral copper catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of A Giant [Mn86] Nanocage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#160;with Specific CO2 Binding Pockets for Highly Selective CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorpiton&#8208;based removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures has demonstrated great potential for solving energy security and environmental sustainability challenges. However, due to similar physicochemical properties between CO2 and other gases as well as the co&#8208;adsorption behavior, the selectivity of CO2 is severely limited in currently reported CO2&#8208;selective sorbents. To address the challenge, we create a bioinspired design strategy and report a robust, microporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with unprecedented [Mn86] nanocages. Attributed to the existence of unique enzyme&#8208;like confined pockets, strong coordination interactions, and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions are generated for CO2 molecules, resulting in only CO2 molecules fitting in the pocket while other gas molecules are prohibited. Thus, this MOF can selectively remove CO2 from various gas mixtures and show record&#8208;high selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures. Highly efficient CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 separations are achieved, as verified by experimental breakthrough tests. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of adsorbents with high CO2 selectivity and provides important guidance for designing highly effective adsorbents for gas separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallaphotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Using Alcohols as Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) represents a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation. However, controlling the enantioselectivity in these processes remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report an unprecedented enantioselective XEC of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with aryl bromides, enabled by the identification of alcohols as reducing agents via Ni/photoredox catalysis. This mechanistically distinct approach exploits the ability of photocatalytically generated &#945;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals to convert alkyl electrophiles to the corresponding alkyl radicals that are then enantioselectively coupled with aryl bromides. The readily scalable protocol allows modular access to valuable enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant and inexpensive precursors, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies rationalize the versatility of this alcohol&#8208;based reactivity for radical generation and subsequent asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. We expect that this alcohol&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling will render a general platform for the development of appealing yet challenging enantioselective XECs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Bonded Ultraconformal Layer between the Elastic Solid Electrolyte and Lithium Anode for High&#8208;performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach to build a lithiophilic surface on elastic rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in a ultraconformal, chemically bonded, mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical operation. Lithium metal batteries containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500&#8197;h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300&#8197;cycles in a full cell.







Abstract
Although high ionic conductivities have been achieved in most solid&#8208;state electrolytes used in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport between solid&#8208;state electrolytes and lithium anodes remains a great challenge due to the high interfacial impedances and infinite volume changes of metallic lithium. In this work, a chemical vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach is developed to establish a lithiophilic surface on rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in the formation of a resilient, ultrathin, and mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical cycling. The resulting ultraconformal layer chemically connects the electrolyte and lithium anode and maintains dynamic contact during operation, thus facilitating rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport across interfaces, as well as promoting uniform lithium deposition and inhibiting side reactions between electrolyte components and metallic lithium. LMBs containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500&#8197;h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300&#8197;cycles in a full cell.

         <title>Enantioselective Effect of Chiral Small Molecules in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccine&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via decorating immunostimulatory small&#8208;molecule resiquimod (R848) to chiral framework R/S&#8208;paracyclophanethe, we synthesized plane&#8208;chiral enantiomer R/S&#8208;ResP. For SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccine, in comparison to R&#8208;ResP, S&#8208;ResP exhibited a significant enhancement for vaccine&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various viral strains. This study revealed the importance of enantioselective effect in the design and construction of chiral small molecule adjuvants.







Abstract
Although numerous chiral small molecules have been discovered and synthesized, the investigation on their enantioselective immunological effects remains limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized a pair of small molecule enantiomers (R/S&#8208;ResP) by covalently bonding two immunostimulators (resiquimod/Res) onto a planar chiral framework (paracyclophane/P). Notably, we found that S&#8208;ResP exhibits a 4.05&#8208;fold higher affinity for toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) than R&#8208;ResP, thereby more effectively enhancing the functions of dendritic cells and macrophages in cytokine secretion and antigen internalization. Furthermore, we observed that S&#8208;ResP significantly enhances RBD antigen&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains compared to R&#8208;ResP. These findings demonstrate the enantioselective effects of small molecules on regulating vaccine&#8208;induced immune responses and emphasize the significance of chirality in designing small molecular adjuvants.

         <title>Covalently Grafting Graphene onto Si Photocathode to Expedite Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin graphene film was closely and tightly grafted onto Si semiconductor via a chemical method. The resulting cathode manifested high kinetics and excellent stability for aqueous photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Silicon semiconductor functionalized with molecular catalysts emerges as a promising cathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the limited kinetics and stabilities remains a major hurdle for the development of such composites. We herein report an assembling strategy of silicon photocathodes via chemically grafting a conductive graphene layer onto the surface of n+&#8208;p Si followed by catalyst immobilization. The covalently&#8208;linked graphene layer effectively enhances the photogenerated carriers transfer between the cathode and the reduction catalyst, and improves the operating stability of the electrode. Strikingly, we demonstrate that altering the stacking configuration of the immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) catalyst through calcination can further enhance the electron transfer rate and the PEC performance. At the end, the graphene&#8208;coated Si cathode immobilized with CoTPP catalyst managed to sustain a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent of &#8722;1.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 16&#8197;h for CO production in water at a near neutral potential of &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. This represents a remarkable improvement of PEC CO2RR performance in contrast to the reported photocathodes functionalized with molecular catalysts.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Electrodes With Sensing Membranes Covalently Attached to Both the Inert Polymer Substrate and Conductive Carbon Contact</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical delamination limits sensor lifetimes and is a major limitation to long&#8208;term monitoring with ion selective electrodes. To address this problem, we developed a photografting polymerization method that simultaneously attaches the sensing membrane covalently to both inert polymeric electrode bodies and carbon conductors. This improves not only the lifetime but also reduces signal drift and reduces the need for recalibration.







Abstract
The use of solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) is of interest to many clinical, environmental, and industrial applications. However, upon extended exposure to samples and under thermal and mechanical stress, adhesion between these membranes and underlying substrates often weakens gradually. Eventually, this results in the formation of a water layer at the interface to the underlying electron conductor and in delamination of the membrane from the electrode body, both major limitations to long&#8208;term monitoring. To prevent these problems without increasing the complexity of design with a mechanical attachment, we use photo&#8208;induced graft polymerization to simultaneously attach ionophore&#8208;doped crosslinked poly(decyl methacrylate) sensing membranes covalently both to a high surface area carbon as ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transducer and to inert polymeric electrode body materials (i.e., polypropylene and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene)). The sensors provide high reproducibility (standard deviation of E0 of 0.2&#8197;mV), long&#8208;term stability (potential drift 7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 over 260&#8197;h), and resistance to sterilization in an autoclave (121&#8201;&#176;C, 2.0&#8197;atm for 30&#8197;min). For this work, a covalently attached H+ selective ionophore was used to prepare pH sensors with advantages over conventional pH glass electrodes, but similar use of other ionophores makes this approach suitable to the fabrication of ISEs for a variety of analytes.

         <title>Light Triggered Pore Size Tuning in Photoswitching Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Low Energy CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The UV light triggered CO2 capture and release upon photoisomerization of azobenzene pendants inside the pore channel of PCTF2.







Abstract
Recently, photo switching porous materials have been widely reported for low energy costed CO2 capture and release via simply remoted light controlling method. However, most reported photo responsive CO2 adsorbents relied on metal organic framework (MOFs) functionalisation with photochromic moieties, and MOF adsorbents still suffered from chemically and thermally unstable issues. Thus, further metal free and highly stable organic photoresponsive adsorbents are necessary to be developed. CTFs, because of their high porosity and stability, have attracted great attention for CO2 capture. Considering the high CO2 uptake capacity and structural tunability of CTFs, it suggests high potential to fabricate the photoswitching CTF materials by the same functionalisation method as MOFs. Herein, the first series of photo switching CTFs were developed for low energy CO2 capture and release. Apart from that, the CO2 switching efficiency could be doubled either through the azobenzene numbers adjusting method or through the previously reported structural alleviation strategy. Furthermore, the pore size distribution of azobenzene functionalised PCTFs also could be tuned under UV exposure, which may contribute to the UV light induced decrease of CO2 uptake capacity. These photoswitching CTFs represented a new kind of porous polymers for low energy costed CO2 capture.

         <title>A Crowning Achievement: The First Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy was designed and implemented by Wu and co&#8208;workers, enabling the first solution&#8208;phase synthesis of circumcoronene derivatives, and providing the first direct evidence to the structure of the debated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Circumcoronene is a highly symmetric polybenzenoid hydrocarbon that has fascinated organic chemists and materials scientists for decades. However, until recently, it had only been studied theoretically, because its synthesis in solution remained challenging. In a recent report, Wu and co&#8208;workers described the first successful solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of crystalline circumcoronene derivatives, validating the long&#8208;predicted Clar structure. Their synthetic approach enables preparation of new polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons with multiple K&#8208;regions, which are difficult to obtain, and expands our understanding of the chemistry of these systems.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Bio&#8208;Based Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Furanic Platforms as Biomass Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we overcome current limitations of biomass furanic platforms, namely the lack of sustainable nitrogen in cellulose&#8208;based furfurals and the lack of reactivity of chitin&#8208;based ones. To this end, a tandem dehydration/oxidative cleavage of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine delivers a new nitrogen&#8208;rich furfural. We further demonstrate the utility of the new furan as a valuable monomer for synthetic chemistry and as a bioconjugation tool.







Abstract
The demand for new biomass&#8208;derived fine and commodity chemicals propels the discovery of new methodologies and synthons. Whereas furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural are cornerstones of sustainable chemistry, 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;acetyl furan (3A5AF), an N&#8208;rich furan obtained from chitin biomass, remains unexplored, due to the poor reactivity of the acetyl group relative to previous furanic aldehydes. Here we developed a reactive 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;furfuryl aldehyde (3A5F) and demonstrated the utility of this synthon as a source of bio&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;rich heteroaromatics, carbocycles, and as a bioconjugation reagent.

         <title>Cyclization of an Achiral Flipping Panel to Homochiral Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of homochiral macrocycles were facilely constructed by cyclization of a dynamic flipping thianthrene moiety with methylene linkages. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the enantiomers and leads to luminescent molecular tubes exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Regulation of the luminescence could be further achieved through supramolecular binding towards electron&#8208;deficient guests.







Abstract
Macrocyclization of the bendable 2,7&#8208;dimethoxythianthrene with methylene linkages afforded a pair of homochiral macrocycles featuring a hex&#8208;nut&#8208;like geometry. Their structures were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the pair of enantiomers which could be readily derivatized. Installing phenylethynyl groups on their rims leads to luminescent tubular macrocycles exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with a large dissymmetry value |glum| of 5&#215;10&#8722;3. Supramolecular binding of electron&#8208;deficient guests by the tube results in fluorescence quenching, which proved its potential for the future development of switchable chiroptical systems.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones with Two Non&#8208;vicinal Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction used for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters is reported. This method has the power to not only produce both diastereoisomers with excellent enantioselectivities but can also provide selectively a single diastereoisomer or all four diastereoisomers depending on the conditions.







Abstract
Chiral heterocycles with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important skeletons in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocycles, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind.

     alt="Copper-Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;-Butyrolactones with Two Non-vicinal Carbon Stereocenters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed radical enantioselective three-component reaction used for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;butyrolactones bearing two non-vicinal carbon stereocenters is reported. This method has the power to not only produce both diastereoisomers with excellent enantioselectivities but can also provide selectively a single diastereoisomer or all four diastereoisomers depending on the conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral heterocycles with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important skeletons in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocycles, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind. We report here a powerful method for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;butyrolactones with two non-vicinal carbon stereocenters from readily available chemical feedstocks under mild conditions. Both of the two diastereoisomers can be obtained with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The well-designed copper/PyBox catalytic system overrides the intrinsic stereoinduction of the close chirality center generated by the previous innocent radical addition step. Nevertheless, this work has the power to selectively provide one single diastereoisomer by taking advantage of the epimerization effect but also to synthesize all four diastereoisomers with the pair of chiral ligands &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L2&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; having opposite chirality. The obtained useful chiral &#947;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;butyrolactones can be synthetically transformed into acyclic or cyclic molecules with two non-vicinal carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical reaction follows a linear relationship and can be well performed with a less loading amount of ligand compared to that of the copper catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Performance of Cobalt Oxide by Protic Ionic Liquid Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of a protic ionic liquid N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) on Co3O4&#8722;x can improve the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttle protons and construct a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment, thus realizing the simultaneous promotion of reactivity and selectivity of the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is an appealing way for small&#8208;scale and decentralized ammonia synthesis and waste nitrate treatment. Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500&#8197;ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4&#8722;x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23&#177;4.97&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and 84.74&#177;3.43&#8201;% at &#8722;1.71 and &#8722;1.41&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4&#8722;x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722; as well as the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.

         <title>Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx Cocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting by Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly (triazine imide) modified with Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively, largely improves the charge separation efficiency and restrains the undesired backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 20.2&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
In situ photo&#8208;deposition of both Pt and CoOx cocatalysts on the facets of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) crystals has been developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, the undesired backward reaction (i.e., water formation) on the noble Pt surface is a spontaneously down&#8208;hill process, which restricts their efficiency to run the overall water splitting reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that the efficiency for photocatalytic overall water splitting could be largely promoted by the decoration of Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively. Results reveal that the dual cocatalysts greatly extract charges from bulk to surface, while the Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst dramatically restrains the backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 20.2&#8201;% for the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction.

         <title>Thermocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Valuable Products Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing efficient catalysts for thermocatalysis of CO2 to valuable products has attracted wide attention, and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have become promising candidates owing to high efficiency and low cost. This review discusses CO2 conversion catalysed by noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs, such as conversion of CO2 to benzimidazoles, N&#8208;formamides, carboxylic acids, carbonic esters, or oxazolidinones.







Abstract
Thermocatalysis of CO2 into high valuable products is an efficient and green method for mitigating global warming and other environmental problems, of which Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 thermocatalysis, and many excellent researches have been published. Hence, this review focuses on the valuable products obtained from various CO2 conversion reactions catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs, such as cyclic carbonates, oxazolidinones, carboxylic acids, N&#8208;phenylformamide, methanol, ethanol, and methane. We classified these published references according to the types of products, and analyzed the methods for improving the catalytic efficiency of MOFs in CO2 reaction. The advantages of using noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOF catalysts for CO2 conversion were also discussed along the text. This review concludes with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this review will be helpful to readers and attract more scientists to join the topic of CO2 conversion.

         <title>Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy: Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The determination of nanometer&#8208;scale distances in solution is an enormous challenge. In their Research Article (e202301465) Gebhard Haberhauer and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that distances in macrocycles can be measured using a molecular spring and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The sensitivity of the method even allows the determination of thermoelasticity at the molecular level: One studied system expands at low temperatures and shrinks at high temperatures.

         <title>A general organophotoredox strategy to difluoroalkyl bicyclo&#8208;alkane (CF2&#8208;BCA) hybrid bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a general approach to the synthesis of the difluoroalkyl bicycloalcanes (CF2&#8208;BCAs), as structural surrogates of aryl ketones and ethers. The chemistry is driven by a dihydrobenzoacridine photocatalyst, that engages in a catalytic electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex, or directly single&#8208;electron reduce the fluorinated substrate. These two convergent manifolds lead to the generation of the R&#8208;CF2 radical, that reacts with the [1.1.1]&#8208; or [3.1.1.]&#8208;propellane. The method is extremely general, and extendable to complex bioactive molecules (30 examples, up to 87% yield). The structural features of the CF2&#8208;BCP hybrid bioisostere were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray. Finally, we synthesised a CF2&#8208;BCP analogue of a Leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, replacing the original aryl ether motif. In&#8208;silico docking studies indicated that this new analogue maintains the same arrangement within the enzyme pocket, profiling the use of the CF2&#8208;BCA hybrid bioisostere in medicinal chemistry settings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of poly(biarylylacetylene)s (PBAs) bearing axially&#8208;chiral (S)&#8208;and (R)&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide residues with a methoxy, propoxy, or acetyloxy substituent at the 3&#8208;position of the biaryl units was synthesized. All the PBAs formed a preferred&#8208;handed helix, while the helical sense preference was varied depending on the substituents despite the same twist&#8208;sense of the biaryl units. Among them, the propoxy&#8208;bound helical PBA showed an exceptionally high chiral recognition ability as a chiral stationary phase (CSP) for high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and efficiently resolved not only various chiral aromatic alcohols, but also a variety of chiral aliphatic alcohols; the latter still remains difficult to resolve by commercially&#8208;available CSPs in HPLC. Such practically&#8208;useful both handed helical PBA&#8208;based CSPs can be produced from the racemic PBA composed of fully racemic monomer units through deracemization of the biaryl units with a chiral alcohol.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photosensitizing Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as a Tandem Reaction Catalyst for Primary Alcohols from Terminal Alkene and Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the wide and growing demand for primary alcohols, the development of efficient catalysts with high regioselectivity remains a worthwhile pursuit. However, according to the Markovnikov&#8217;s rule, it is challenge to obtain primary alcohols with high yields and regioselectivity from terminal alkenes or alkynes. Herein, we reported the synthesis of a photosensitizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) from cyclic trinuclear copper(I) units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) and boron dipyrro&#8208;methene (Bodipy) ligand. The MOF features broadband light absorption, excellent photoinduced charge separation efficiency, and photochemical properties. By integrating the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration and photocatalyzed aerobic oxidation, it can catalyze terminal alkenes and alkynes to produce primary alcohols via one&#8208;pot tandem reaction with excellent regioselectivity, good overall yields in two&#8208;step reactions (up to 85%), broad substrate compatibility (32 examples) and good reusability under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Tuned TSCT&#8208;TADF in Donor&#8208;Acceptor MOF for Highly Adjustable Photonic Modules based on Heterostructures Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly adjustable photonic modules were constructed based on the heterostructures crystals of a new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8208;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By introducing N&#8208;phenylcarbazoleand derivatives as donor guests into the acceptor host NKU&#8208;111, highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer based TADF could be achieved through the engineering of heavy atom effect , which result in modulatable emission wavelength (540 to 600 nm) and enhanced quantum yield&#160; (up to 30.86%). Furthermore, by rationally integrating the D&#8208; A MOFs with distinctive TADF emissions, rod&#8208;like heterostructures crystals featuring excitation position dependent tip emissions in wide wavelength range (495 to 598 nm) could be fabricated, which could serve as highly potential photonic modules for photonic circuit applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;BOX Catalyzed Asymmetric 3&#8208;Component Reaction for the Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Propargylic Ethers and Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric 3&#8208;component reaction between EthynylBenziodoXoles (EBXs), 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane and nucleophiles catalyzed by a Cu(I)&#8208;BOX (Bisoxazoline) catalyst is described. This protocol gives access to chiral trifluoromethylated propargyl ethers and anilines, which are valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity and yield with different nucleophiles such as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, as well as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor anilines. Aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes can be successfully introduced as electrophiles. In case of chiral substrates, high catalyst control was observed, leading to good diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversing the Enantioselectivity of Enzymatic Carbene N&#8211;H Insertion Through Mechanism&#8208;Guided Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a computationally driven approach to access enantiodivergent enzymatic carbene N&#8211;H insertions catalyzed by P411 enzymes. Computational modeling was employed to rationally guide engineering efforts to control the accessible conformations of a key lactone&#8208;carbene (LAC) intermediate in the enzyme active site by installing a new H&#8208;bond anchoring point. This H&#8208;bonding interaction controls the relative orientation of the reactive carbene intermediate, orienting it for an enantioselective&#160;N&#8208;nucleophilic attack by the amine substrate. By combining MD simulations and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screening targeted to only two key residues, we were able to reverse the stereoselectivity of previously engineered&#160;S&#8208;selective P411 enzymes. The resulting variant,&#160;L5_FL&#8208;B3, accepts a broad scope of amine substrates for N&#8208;H insertion with excellent yields (up to &gt;99%), high efficiency (up to 12,300 TTN), and good enantiocontrol (up to 7:93&#160;er).</dc:description>

         <title>Living Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Hetero Diels&#8208;Alder Adducts to Give Multifactor&#8208;Controlled and Fast&#8208;Photodegradable Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of multiple structural parameters associated with vinyl polymers is important for producing materials with the desired properties and functions. While the development of living polymerization methods has provided a way to control the various structural parameters of vinyl polymers, the concomitant control of their sequence and regioregularity remains a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, herein, we report the living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of hetero Diels&#8208;Alder adducts. The scalable and modular synthesis of the cyclic monomers was achieved by a one&#8208;step protocol using readily available vinyl precursors. Subsequently, living polymerization of the cyclic monomers was examined, allowing the synthesis of vinyl polymers while controlling multiple factors, including molecular weight, dispersity, alternating sequence, head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity, and end&#8208;group functionality. The living characteristics of the developed method were further demonstrated by block copolymerization. The synthesized vinyl polymers exhibited unique thermal properties and underwent fast photodegradation even under sunlight.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proximity&#8208;Induced Fluorogenic Reaction Triggered by Antibody&#8211;Antigen Interactions with Adjacent Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proximity&#8208;induced chemical reactions are site&#8208;specific and rapid by taking advantage of their high affinity and highly selective interactions with the template. However, reactions induced solely by antibody&#8211;antigen interactions have not been developed. Herein, we propose a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER) as a novel template reaction. In BATER, reactive functional groups are conjugated to two antibodies that interact with two epitopes of the same antigen to accelerate the reaction. We developed a method for visualizing the progress of BATER using fluorogenic click chemistry for optimal antibody selection and linker design. The reaction is accelerated in the presence of a specific antigen in a link&#8208;er length&#8208;dependent manner. The choice of the antibody epitope is important for a rapid reaction. This design will lead to various applications of BATER in living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Superoxide&#8208;Triggered Nanoreporters for Crosstalk&#8208;Free Dual Fluorescence/Chemiluminescence Imaging and Urinalysis in Living Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminescence imaging has been recognized as a valuable tool for ultrasensitive detection of physio&#8208;pathological events through elimination of background autofluorescence. However, most chemiluminescent nanoprobes suffer from shallow imaging depths and slow clearance from living bodies, which impede their use in clinical settings. We herein report size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters (ADN1 and ADN2) that could be activated at disease site by superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) to trigger nanostructure disassembly into renal excretable fluorescent fragments as well as chemiluminescence turn&#8208;on for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinalysis. In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated O2&#8226;&#8722; to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620 nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19 h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red&#8208;shifted chemiluminescence at ~800 nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic properties of predesignable topologies and tunable electronic structures, coupled with the elevation of electrical conductivity, enable two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) as highly prospective candidates for next&#8208;generation electronic/spintronic devices. In this minireview, we present an outline of the design principles of 2D MOF&#8208;based spintronics materials. Then, we highlight the spin transport properties of 2D MOF&#8208;based organic spin valves (OSVs) as a notable achievement in the progress of 2D MOFs for spintronic devices. After that, we also discuss the potential for spin manipulation in 2D MOFs with bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) properties as a promising field for future research. Finally, we provide a brief summary and outlook to encourage the development of novel 2D MOFs for spintronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide perovskites (HPs) recently have emerged as one class of competitive scintillators for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to its high quantum efficiency, short decay time, superior X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, low cost, and ease of crystal growth. The tunable structure and versatile chemical compositions of halide perovskites provide distinguishable advantages over traditional inorganic scintillators for optimizing scintillation performance. Since the first observation of the scintillation phenomenon in HPs, substantial efforts have been devoted to expanding the inventory of HP scintillators and regulating material properties. Understanding the relationship between the structure and scintillation properties of HP scintillators is essential for developing materials with improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging capacities. This review summarizes strategies for improving the light yield of HP scintillators and provides a roadmap for improving the X&#8208;ray imaging performance. Additionally, methods for controlling the light propagation direction in HP scintillators are highlighted for improving X&#8208;ray imaging resolution. Finally, we highlight the current challenge in HP scintillators and provide a perspective on the future development of this emerging scintillator.</dc:description>

         <title>CuCoO2 Nanoparticles as a Nanoprotease for Selective Proteolysis with High Efficiency at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many nanoproteases contain tetravalent metal ions and catalyze peptide&#8208;bond hydrolysis only at high temperature (60 &#176;C). Here, we report a new and effective strategy to explore nanoproteases from the nanoparticles containing low valent metal ions. We found that flower&#8208;like CuCoO2 nanoparticles (CuCoO2 NPs) containing low valent Cu+ possessed excellent catalytic activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bonds with hydrophobic residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature. CuCoO2 NPs exhibited excellent stability and had great reuse performance. CuCoO2 NPs also hydrolyzed heat&#8208;denatured and surfactant&#8208;denatured BSA. Mechanism analysis revealed that the high Lewis acidity of Co3+ and the low valence of Cu+ were both essential for the high protease activity of CuCoO2 NPs. The flower&#8208;like structure of CuCoO2 NPs and the strong nucleophilicity of Cu+&#8208;bound hydroxyl endue them with excellent catalytic performance. The findings open a new way for design and discovery of high&#8208;efficiency nanoproteases.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Exclusion Separation of 1&#8208;Butene Isomers by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating n&#8208;butene and i&#8208;butene by adsorption is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but designing porous adsorbents that distinguish the subtle differences between the isomers is extremely challenging. Currently, adsorbents that can sieve 1&#8208;butene isomers and are stable enough to withstand humid gas mixtures are largely unmet. Herein, we propose a robust ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MET&#8208;Fe) that can separate 1&#8208;butene isomers through molecular exclusion. The pore aperture size (4.6 &#197;) precisely matches the kinetic diameters of the isomers, as verified by static and kinetic adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, easy regeneration, and remarkable reusability of MET&#8208;Fe in both dry and humid conditions. With its high selectivity, large breakthrough capacity, and outstanding stability, MET&#8208;Fe provides an ideal platform for industrial butene isomers separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enaminone&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), possessing pre&#8208;designable structures and tailorable functionalities, are promising candidates for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the most studied imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) usually suffer from unsatisfactory stability and photocatalytic performance. To meet this challenge, a series of highly stable enaminone&#8208;linked COFs (En&#8208;COFs) have been synthesized and afford much improved visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production activities, ranging from 44 to 1078 times that of isoreticular Im&#8208;COFs, with the only difference being the linkages (enaminone vs. imine) in their structures. The enhanced light&#8208;harvesting ability, facilitated exciton dissociation and improved chemical stability account for the superior activity. Furthermore, quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (Qu&#8208;COFs) have been further obtained via the post&#8208;modification of Im&#8208;COFs. Compared with Im&#8208;COFs, the photocatalytic activities of Qu&#8208;COFs are significantly improved after modification, but still below those of the corresponding En&#8208;COFs (3&#8211;107 times). The facile synthesis, excellent activity, and high chemical stability demonstrate that En&#8208;COFs are a promising platform for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Locked Cyclo[2]Dipyrrins Linked with Anthracene Subunits: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of anthracene containing twisted Cyclo[2]dipyrrin 1 utilizing a non&#8208;planar building block, 1,5&#8208;dipyrrylanthracene (1,5&#8208;DPA). The non&#8208;planar nature of macrocycle enhanced the solubility and helps in structural characterization. Macrocycle 1 adopts a twisted &#8216;figure of eight&#8217; conformation stabilized by strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions and exist as a pair of helical enantiomers as revealed from X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. More importantly, the sterically locked structure offered facile optical resolution using chiral HPLC. The (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomers shows moderate chiroptical properties such as absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| in the order of 10&#8208;3, and luminescence dissymmetry factor |glum| of 3.8 x 10&#8208;3 and 2.9 x 10&#8208;3 at 702 nm respectively.</dc:description>

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the MacLachlan group at the University of British Columbia. They recently published an article on the uniform growth of a metal&#8211;organic framework, ZIF&#8208;8, on the surface of individual cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). After the ZIF&#8208;8/CNC fibers had been coated with a microporous organic polymer, the ZIF&#8208;8 was removed to leave a microporous polymer with CNCs encapsulated in a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle architecture.

         <title>Hidden Lives. Early Childhood Care as an Academic: The Slow Burn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hidden Lives series documents the &#8220;second jobs&#8221; of our colleagues, the invisible work that often goes unseen. In this first Viewpoint Article, we see the challenges of early childhood care set against the backdrop of societal shifts in caretaker roles and job responsibilities.







Abstract
As the inaugural entry in the new series Hidden Lives, this Viewpoint Article highlights challenges in early childhood care faced by academicians. Research centers must adapt to societal shifts in family structure, uncertainty around research funding, expanded job responsibilities and upheavals brought about by the pandemic. These problems represent opportunities for change at the technological, cultural and policy levels. It is crucial that we recognize those in need and help where we can.

         <title>Achieving Digital Catalysis: Strategies for Data Acquisition, Storage and Use</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In catalysis, a paradigm shift in data acquisition and management is needed to address the challenges in developing high&#8208;performance, stable, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for energy storage and sustainable, climate&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis. Considering the scientific principles of catalysis, the requirements for the future research data infrastructure are discussed.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysis is an important area of research that generates data as intricate as the phenomenon itself. Complexity is inherently coupled to the function of the catalyst and advance in knowledge can only be achieved if this complexity is adequately captured and accounted for. This requires integration of experiment and theory, high data quality and quality control, close interdisciplinary collaboration, and sharing of data and metadata, which is facilitated by the application of joint data management strategies. This Viewpoint Article first discusses the potential of a digital transition in catalysis research. Then, a summary of the current status in terms of data infrastructure in heterogeneous catalysis is presented, defining the various types of (meta&#8208;) data, from catalyst synthesis to functional analysis. Finally, an already implemented working concept for local data acquisition and storage is introduced and the benefits and further development directions for catalysis data use and sharing are discussed.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Conjugated Dienes with Tertiary Silanes Controlled by Hemilabile Hybrid P,O Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hemilabile P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, are developed. The use of P,O ligands has not only significantly improved reactivity for Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes but has also achieved an unprecedented regioselectivity for Pd&#8208;catalyzed diene functionalization towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation.







Abstract
Novel P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, were synthesized and utilized in Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation involving tertiary silanes, unactivated alkenes, and conjugated dienes. The ligand displayed a remarkable level of reactivity for alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes and its use resulted in a significant improvement in the regioselectivity of diene hydrosilylation towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, with coordination of phosphorus and oxygen. Control experiments provided evidence for the formation of Pd0 species and the reversibility of Pd&#8722;H insertion in the reaction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) computations supported the importance of the hemilabile P,O ligand in stabilizing both the rate&#8208;determining transition state of Pd&#8722;H insertion and the transition state of reductive elimination that determines the regioselectivity.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis for Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals and Hydrogen: Facts, Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent developments in the chemistry of photocatalytic biomass conversion into chemicals and fuels, emphasizing the role of experimental factors and materials design. A critical technological analysis to facilitate the scaling up of this technology is provided based on the reported research studies and industrial need.







Abstract
Photocatalytic biomass conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels is considered one of the hottest ongoing research and industrial topics toward sustainable development. In short, this process can cleave C&#946;&#8722;O/C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bonds in lignin to aromatic platform chemicals, and further conversion of the polysaccharides to other platform chemicals and H2. From the chemistry point of view, the optimization of the unique cooperative interplay of radical oxidation species (which are activated via molecular oxygen species, ROSs) and substrate&#8208;derived radical intermediates by appropriate control of their type and/or yield is key to the selective production of desired products. Technically, several challenges have been raised that face successful real&#8208;world applications. This review aims to discuss the recently reported mechanistic pathways toward selective biomass conversion through the optimization of ROSs behavior and materials/system design. On top of that, through a SWOT analysis, we critically discussed this technology from both chemistry and technological viewpoints to help the scientists and engineers bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale and large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Stabilizing Interfaces in High&#8208;Temperature NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries via Tuning Terminal Alkyl Chains of Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose that by extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes can be improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at 1&#8197;M. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich SEI/CEI is achieved. The surface phase transition and structural degradation of the NCM811 cathode are also alleviated.







Abstract
Ether electrolytes are promising for lithium metal batteries. Despite the intensive research in recent years, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ether electrolytes still cannot form reliable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in NCM811&#8208;Li batteries at diluted concentrations, especially in those operating at elevated temperatures. We report a simple but effective strategy to break this bottleneck and stabilize interfaces in high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li batteries in ether electrolytes. We propose that by gradually extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes is improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at a concentration of 1&#8197;M. Accordingly, the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208; /cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. Additionally, the surface phase transition and structural degradation of NCM811 cathode are alleviated. Consequently, in the ethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte, the Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8722;Cu cells working at 60&#8201;&#176;C is boosted to 99.41&#8201;% with a cycling life of over 200&#8197;cycles. The lifespan of high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li cells is prolonged by more than 400&#8201;% with a stable average Coulombic efficiency of 99.77&#8201;% at quasi&#8208;practical conditions of 50&#8197;&#956;m Li, lean electrolyte of 10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1, and medium&#8208;high cathode loading of &gt;2.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Volatile Dual&#8208;Solvent Assisted Intermediate Phase Regulation for Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate is constructed with a dual&#8208;component volatile solvent. By suppressing the nucleation rate in volatile precursor, this strategy provides a controllable grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition without post&#8208;treatments.







Abstract
The unprecedented development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) makes them one of the most promising candidates for terawatt&#8208;scale green energy production with low cost. However, the high boiling point solvents during the solution&#8208;processed film deposition cause anisotropic crystal growth and toxic solvent vapor during high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. Here, a dual&#8208;component green solvent consisting of isopropyl acetate and acetonitrile is proposed to form a volatile perovskite precursor, which can realize the high&#8208;quality perovskite thin film deposition by intermediate phase regulation. A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate phase is constructed with the engagement of isopropyl acetate as co&#8208;solvent, which suppresses the exploding nucleation rate in volatile perovskite precursor, providing a fine grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition. The corresponding PSCs fabricated by blade coating without anti&#8208;solvents or gas quenching achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.37&#8201;% and 15.29&#8201;% for the areas of 14.08&#8197;cm2 and 37.83&#8197;cm2, respectively.

         <title>Regulation of Atomic Fe&#8208;Spin State by Crystal Field and Magnetic Field for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen electrocatalysis on iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts is highly correlated to the spin configuration of Fe active sites. A crystal field and magnetic field synergetic strategy is proposed to regulate spin state of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C from low spin (LS) to intermediate spin (MS) and high spin (HS), and the high spin FeIII&#8722;N&#8722;C is the most favorable for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;active and low&#8208;cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution are essential in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries, and single atom catalysts with Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C are promising candidates. However, the activity still needs to be boosted, and the origination of spin&#8208;related oxygen catalytic performance is still uncertain. Herein, an effective strategy to regulate local spin state of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C through manipulating crystal field and magnetic field is proposed. The spin state of atomic Fe can be regulated from low spin to intermediate spin and to high spin. The cavitation of dxz and dyz orbitals of high spin FeIII can optimize the O2 adsorption and promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*O2 to *OOH). Benefiting from these merits, the high spin Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst displays the highest oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the high spin Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery displays a high power density of 170&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good stability.

         <title>A Chemoenzymatic Approach To Produce a Cyclic Analogue of the Analgesic Drug MVIIA (Ziconotide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method has been developed to prepare backbone cyclic analogues of the &#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA. The most potent cyclic analogue, cM&#8208;7, shows highly improved stability and maintains the activity of the native peptide.







Abstract
Ziconotide (&#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)&#8208;mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six&#8208; to nine&#8208;residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.

&lt;p&gt;A chemoenzymatic method has been developed to prepare backbone cyclic analogues of the &#969;-conotoxin MVIIA. The most potent cyclic analogue, cM-7, shows highly improved stability and maintains the activity of the native peptide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziconotide (&#969;-conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)-mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six- to nine-residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Site Carbon&#8208;Supported Metal&#8208;Oxo Complexes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: Structure, Reactivity, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, single&#8208;site carbon&#8208;supported Mo(=O)2 catalysts, Carbon/MoO2, are prepared via the direct grafting of molecular MoO2 precursors onto various carbon supports. These catalysts are highly active, selective, stable, and recyclable. Here, we summarize the experimental and computational investigations of the structures, reaction scope, and mechanistic pathways of this catalytic system.







Abstract
When early transition metal complexes are molecularly grafted onto catalyst supports, well&#8208;defined, surface&#8208;bound species are created, which are highly active and selective single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts (SSHCs) for diverse chemical transformations. In this minireview, we analyze and summarize a less conventional type of SSHC in which molybdenum dioxo species are grafted onto unusual carbon&#8208;unsaturated scaffolds, such as activated carbon, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon nanohorns. The choice of earth&#8208;abundant, low&#8208;toxicity, versatile metal constituents, and various carbon supports illustrates &#8220;catalyst by design&#8221; principles and yields insights into new catalytic systems of both academic and technological interest. Here, we summarize experimental and computational investigations of the bonding, electronic structure, reaction scope, and mechanistic pathways of these unusual catalysts.

         <title>Darobactin B Stabilises a Lateral&#8208;Closed Conformation of the BAM Complex in E. coli Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The darobactins are promising new antibiotics that inhibit the BAM complex, an essential membrane&#8208;protein foldase in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Here, we use EPR spectroscopy (PELDOR, or DEER) distance measurements to monitor the effect of darobactin B on BAM in E.&#8197;coli cells, showing it stabilises BAM in a lateral gate closed conformational state. Our results provide the first direct evidence for conformational selection by a darobactin in the cellular context.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM complex) is essential for outer membrane protein (OMP) folding in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, and represents a promising antimicrobial target. Several conformational states of BAM have been reported, but all have been obtained under conditions which lack the unique features and complexity of the outer membrane (OM). Here, we use Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR, or DEER) spectroscopy distance measurements to interrogate the conformational ensemble of the BAM complex in E.&#8197;coli cells. We show that BAM adopts a broad ensemble of conformations in the OM, while in the presence of the antibiotic darobactin B (DAR&#8208;B), BAM&#8242;s conformational equilibrium shifts to a restricted ensemble consistent with the lateral closed state. Our in&#8208;cell PELDOR findings are supported by new cryoEM structures of BAM in the presence and absence of DAR&#8208;B. This work demonstrates the utility of PELDOR to map conformational changes in BAM within its native cellular environment.

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different reaction types (homolytic, heterolytic, and electrocyclic cleavage) can be selectively activated in the gas phase through a modulation of noncovalent interactions for a multifunctional amino&#8208;azoalkane, as shown by mass spectrometry, transition&#8208;state modeling, and DFT calculations. Three different &#963; bonds are being broken, demonstrating a supramolecular control of chemoselectivity that is reminiscent of mode&#8208;selective chemistry.







Abstract
In the gas phase, thermal activation of supramolecular assemblies such as host&#8211;guest complexes leads commonly to noncovalent dissociation into the individual components. Chemical reactions, for example of encapsulated guest molecules, are only found in exceptional cases. As observed by mass spectrometry, when 1&#8208;amino&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;2&#8208;ene (DBOA) is complexed by the macrocycle &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, its protonated complex undergoes collision&#8208;induced dissociation into its components, the conventional reaction pathway. Inside the macrocyclic cavity of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), a competitive chemical reaction of monoprotonated DBOA takes place upon thermal activation, namely a stepwise homolytic covalent bond cleavage with the elimination of N2, while the doubly protonated CB7&#8901;DBOA complex undergoes an inner&#8208;phase elimination of ethylene, a concerted, electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction. These chemical reaction pathways stand in contrast to the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of uncomplexed monoprotonated DBOA, for which an elimination of NH3 predominates upon collision&#8208;induced activation, as a heterolytic bond cleavage reaction. The combined results, which can be rationalized in terms of organic&#8208;chemical reaction mechanisms and density&#8208;function theoretical calculations, demonstrate that chemical reactions in the gas phase can be steered chemoselectively through noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Revealing Excited&#8208;State Trajectories on Potential Energy Surfaces with Atomic Resolution in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited&#8208;state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8211;metal &#963;&#8208;bond formation and its stretching vibrations were detected in real time by femtosecond wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing were the Pt&#8722;Pt distance and the ligand orientation, along which the excited&#8208;state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated potential energy surfaces of the excited states.







Abstract
Photoexcited molecular trajectories on potential energy surfaces (PESs) prior to thermalization are intimately connected to the photochemical reaction outcome. The excited&#8208;state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8211;metal &#963;&#8208;bond formation and associated Pt&#8722;Pt stretching motions were detected in real time using femtosecond wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. The observed motions correspond well with coherent vibrational wavepacket motions detected by femtosecond optical transient absorption. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing have been identified, the Pt&#8722;Pt bond length and the orientation of the ligands coordinated with the platinum centers, along which the excited&#8208;state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated PESs of the excited states. This investigation has gleaned novel insight into electronic transitions occurring on the time scales of vibrational motions measured in real time, revealing ultrafast nonadiabatic or non&#8208;equilibrium processes along excited&#8208;state trajectories involving multiple excited&#8208;state PESs.

         <title>Doubly Strapped Zwitterionic NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Bioconjugation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and efficient synthetic method produces conjugatable sterically shielded heptamethine cyanine dyes for in vivo NIR&#8208;I or NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. The fluorochromes are enclosed by two flanking straps which enhance fluorescence brightness and chemical stability, prevent dye stacking on the surface of an antibody, and enable high performance fluorescence imaging of a mouse tumor.







Abstract
Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800&#8208;1 have been tested in humans. However, long&#8208;term imaging protocols using ZW800&#8208;1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800&#8208;1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor&#8208;targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile and efficient synthetic method produces conjugatable sterically shielded heptamethine cyanine dyes for in vivo NIR-I or NIR-II fluorescence imaging. The fluorochromes are enclosed by two flanking straps which enhance fluorescence brightness and chemical stability, prevent dye stacking on the surface of an antibody, and enable high performance fluorescence imaging of a mouse tumor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye &lt;b&gt;ZW800-1&lt;/b&gt; have been tested in humans. However, long-term imaging protocols using &lt;b&gt;ZW800-1&lt;/b&gt; conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8242;-O-aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of &lt;b&gt;ZW800-1&lt;/b&gt;, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR-I and NIR-II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor-targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Tetra&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Enamido Phosphorus Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation of congested tetra&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphorus derivatives was developed by employing commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos as the catalyst. This protocol offers a straightforward entry to a broad variety of previously difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphonates/phosphine oxides bearing two vicinal stereocenters embedded in various ring structures.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of enamido phosphorus derivatives is one of the most efficient methods for the construction of chiral amino phosphorus products, among which the congested tetra&#8208;substituted substrates remains an unaddressed challenge. In this study, we utilize a commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos system for the efficient and stereoselective hydrogenation of a wide set of tetra&#8208;substituted cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphonates/phosphine oxides, thus enabling access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphorus compounds featuring two vicinal stereocenters. This protocol was broadly applicable to different ring systems possessing various phosphonate/phosphine oxide groups and further applied in the preparation of amino&#8208;phosphine ligands. DFT mechanistic explorations indicate that the C=C migratory insertion into RhIII&#8722;H bond could be the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step. The origins of stereoselectivity are revealed through distortion/interaction analysis, which is primarily regulated by distinguished dispersion interactions and steric repulsions.

         <title>Nanostructure&#8208;Driven Indocyanine Green Dimerization Generates Ultra&#8208;Stable Phototheranostics Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Indocyanine Green (ICG) stabilized nanoemulsion enables 100&#8201;% ICG dimerization and J&#8208;aggregation spontaneously on its shell to afford a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) that demonstrates superior photothermal conversion efficiency, photostability, and structure stability over ICG, giving an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform for photoacoustic imaging and effective photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye approved for clinical use. Despite its versatility in photonic applications and potential for photothermal therapy, its photobleaching hinders its application. Here we discovered a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) generated by using ICG to stabilize nanoemulsions, after which ICG enabled complete dimerization on the nanoemulsion shell, followed by J&#8208;aggregation of ICG&#8208;dimer, resulting in a narrow, red&#8208;shifted (780&#8197;nm&#8594;894&#8197;nm) and intense (&#8776;2&#8208;fold) absorbance. Compared to ICG, Nano&#8208;dICG demonstrated superior photothermal conversion (2&#8208;fold higher), significantly reduced photodegradation (&#8722;9.6&#8201;% vs. &#8722;46.3&#8201;%), and undiminished photothermal effect (7 vs. 2&#8197;cycles) under repeated irradiations, in addition to excellent colloidal and structural stabilities. Following intravenous injection, Nano&#8208;dICG enabled real&#8208;time tracking of its delivery to mouse tumors within 24&#8197;h by photoacoustic imaging at NIR wavelength (890&#8197;nm) distinct from the endogenous signal to guide effective photothermal therapy. The unprecedented finding of nanostructure&#8208;driven ICG dimerization leads to an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform.

         <title>Discovery of the Azaserine Biosynthetic Pathway Uncovers a Biological Route for &#945;&#8208;Diazoester Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the &#945;&#8208;diazoester natural product azaserine is reported. Isotope feeding and biochemical experiments implicate generation of a hydrazonoacetic acid intermediate that is oxidized and transferred to l&#8208;serine. This pathway represents a distinct biosynthetic strategy for diazo formation.







Abstract
Azaserine is a bacterial metabolite containing a biologically unusual and synthetically enabling &#945;&#8208;diazoester functional group. Herein, we report the discovery of the azaserine (aza) biosynthetic gene cluster from Glycomyces harbinensis. Discovery of related gene clusters reveals previously unappreciated azaserine producers, and heterologous expression of the aza gene cluster confirms its role in azaserine assembly. Notably, this gene cluster encodes homologues of hydrazonoacetic acid (HYAA)&#8208;producing enzymes, implicating HYAA in &#945;&#8208;diazoester biosynthesis. Isotope feeding and biochemical experiments support this hypothesis. These discoveries indicate that a 2&#8208;electron oxidation of a hydrazonoacetyl intermediate is required for &#945;&#8208;diazoester formation, constituting a distinct logic for diazo biosynthesis. Uncovering this biological route for &#945;&#8208;diazoester synthesis now enables the production of a highly versatile carbene precursor in cells, facilitating approaches for engineering complete carbene&#8208;mediated biosynthetic transformations in vivo.

         <title>An ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Mediates Disulfide Migration in the Biosynthesis of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide in pretrichodermamide A involves the formation of an &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by the oxygenase TdaR containing the canonical CXXC motif, followed by disulfide migration by the oxygenase TdaE containing a specialized CXXQ motif, via an ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate. The enzymatic cascade reactions can be considered as a general catalytic mechanism for &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide formation in epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs).







Abstract
The transannular disulfide functions as a key structural element imparting diverse biological activities to epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs). Although mechanisms were proposed in previous studies, &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide formation in ETPs is not well&#8208;determined owing to the failure to identify the hypothetical intermediate. Herein, we characterize the key ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM) intermediate and prove its involvement in the carbon&#8208;sulfur migration from an &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208; to an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by elucidating pretrichodermamide A biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by a FAD&#8208;dependent thioredoxin oxygenase TdaE harboring a noncanonical CXXQ motif. Biochemical investigations of recombinant TdaE and mutants demonstrated that the construction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide was initiated by Gln140 triggering proton abstraction for generation of the essential o&#8208;QM intermediate, accompanied by &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy elimination. Subsequent attack on the &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by Cys137 led to disulfide migration and spirofuran formation. This study expands the biocatalytic toolbox for transannular disulfide formation and sets the stage for the targeted discovery of bioactive ETPs.

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of gem&#8208;Dihaloalkanes and Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopropane derivatives are essential in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Their synthesis commonly relies on asymmetric cyclopropanation of diazo compounds, potentially explosive and needing stabilizing substituents. Thus, asymmetric catalytic transformations of non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, non&#8208;linear effect, and UV/Vis spectroscopy, provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of amine&#8208;reactive superhydrophobic film that is facilely coated on various substrates is reported by Xinjian Xie and Wenqian Feng in their Research Article (e202302837). The remarkable spatial controllability of surface amine modification is shown, enabling the facile creation of vertical circuits. This discovery provides a distinct approach to establish interlayer electrical connectivity (IEC) within 3D electronic systems.

         <title>Catalytic Photoinduced Intramolecular Decarboxylative and Desulfonylative sp3 Allylation Enabled by Sulfinate Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced intramolecular decarboxylative and desulfonylative sp3 allylation of allyl esters or sulfones enabled by simple, yet available, sulfinate catalysts is described herein. This technique complements classical protocols based on noble Pd catalysts and also facilitates rapid and reliable access to molecular architectures of utmost relevance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a catalytic intramolecular decarboxylative/desulfonylative sp3 allylation triggered by sulfinate salts under light irradiation. The reaction is likely enabled by a non&#8208;classical, radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, allowing rapid and reliable access to valuable allyl architectures from readily accessible precursors. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and scalability, employing abundant, commercially available catalysts.

         <title>Digital Microfluidics and Magnetic Bead&#8208;Based Intact Proteoform Elution for Quantitative Top&#8208;down Nanoproteomics of Single C.&#8197;elegans Nematodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a sensitive microfluidics&#8208;based workflow for quantitative top&#8208;down proteomics of single nematodes of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (containing &lt;1000&#8197;cells). Here, nematodes are lysed on digital microfluidics chips, and proteins aggregated with magnetic beads are eluted off with formic acid. Using differential ion mobility mass spectrometry, we could quantify changes in the proteoform abundances of single nematodes.







Abstract
While most nanoproteomics approaches for the analysis of low&#8208;input samples are based on bottom&#8208;up proteomics workflows, top&#8208;down approaches enabling proteoform characterization are still underrepresented. Using mammalian cell proteomes, we established a facile one&#8208;pot sample preparation protocol based on protein aggregation on magnetic beads and intact proteoform elution using 40&#8201;% formic acid. Performed on a digital microfluidics device, the workflow enabled sensitive analyses of single Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, thereby increasing the number of proteoform identifications compared to in&#8208;tube sample preparation by 46&#8201;%. Label&#8208;free quantification of single nematodes grown under different conditions allowed to identify changes in the abundance of proteoforms not distinguishable by bottom&#8208;up proteomics. The presented workflow will facilitate proteoform&#8208;directed analysis on samples of limited availability.

         <title>Improvement of Antibody Activity by Controlling Its Dynamics Using the Glycan&#8211;Lectin Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody dynamics on membranes, such as endocytosis and clustering, are vital in determining antibody functions. Yoshiyuki Manabe, Kazuya Kabayama, Koichi Fukase et&#8197;al. proposed a new approach to modulate antibody dynamics and its function. In their Communication (e202304779), the antibody was conjugated with galactose&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycan, and its internalization was suppressed by the interaction with galectin&#8208;3, leading to the enhancement of complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity. The glycan&#8211;antibody conjugate might provide an alternative strategy for enhancing antibody activity.

         <title>Coupled Solar Battery with 6.9% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage in solar batteries is an important solar utilization technology comparable to solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity (solar cells) and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel (photocatalytic cells) conversion. Unlike the indirect approach of integrated solar flow batteries combining photoelectrodes with redox&#8208;electrodes, coupled solar batteries enable direct solar energy storage, but are hampered by low efficiency due to rapid charge recombination of materials and misaligned energy levels between electrodes. Herein, we propose a design for a coupled solar battery that intercouples two photo&#8208;coupled ion transfer (PCIT) reactions through electron&#8208;ion transfer upon co&#8208;photo&#8208;pumping of photoelectrochemical storage cathode and anode. We used a representative covalent organic framework (COF) to achieve efficient charge separation and directional charge transfer between two band&#8208;matched photoelectrochemical storage electrodes, with a photovoltage sufficient for COF dual&#8208;redox reactions. By pumping these electrodes, the coupled solar battery stores solar energy via two synergistic PCIT reactions of electron&#8208;proton&#8208;relayed COF oxidation and reduction, and the stored solar energy is released as electrochemical energy during COF regeneration in discharge while interlocking the loops. A breakthrough in efficiency (6.9%) was achieved, adaptive to a large&#8208;area (56 cm2) tandem device. The presented photo&#8208;intercoupled electron&#8208;ion transfer (PIEIT) mechanism provides expandable paths toward practical solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar-to-electrochemical energy storage in solar batteries is an important solar utilization technology comparable to solar-to-electricity (solar cells) and solar-to-fuel (photocatalytic cells) conversion.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Thiamyxins A&#8211;C and Thiamyxin E, a Potent Class of RNA&#8208;Virus&#8208;Inhibiting (Cyclo)depsipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the first total synthesis of the thiamyxins A&#8208;C and the now fully characterized thiamyxin E, an interesting class of thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich depsipeptides with diverse antiviral activity. The synthesis features a parallel closing of two methyl thiazoline units, with low epimerization of the very labile adjacent stereocenter. It also includes the three&#8208;step synthesis of an uncommon hydroxy acid and the oxidation&#8208;free elimination of a phenylselenide to form a dehydroalanine moiety. The exploitation of the acid labile stereocenter at the isoleucine moiety and the reopening of the macrolactones gave access to the four thiamyxins with good yields and diastereomeric purities from a single precursor. The modular total synthesis allows further testing of the biological activity and gives opportunities to explore the pharmacophore and antiviral target via derivatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids from NO and other NOx species over CoFe alloy&#8208;decorated Self&#8208;standing Carbon Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;value products is significantly meaningful for global environment and human health. And green synthesis of amino acids is vital for biomedical research and sustainable development of mankind. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative approach for converting nitric oxide (NO) to a series of &#945;&#8208;amino acids (over 13 kinds) through electrosynthesis with &#945;&#8208;keto acids over self&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane with CoFe alloy. The essential leucine exhibits a high yield of 115.4 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 corresponding a Faradaic efficiency of 32.4%, and gram yield of products can be obtained within 24 hours in lab as well as an ultra&#8208;long stability (&gt;240 h) of the membrane catalyst, which could convert NO into NH2OH rapidly attacking &#945;&#8208;keto acid and subsequent hydrogenation to form amino acid. In addition, this method is also suitable for other nitrogen sources including gaseous NO2 or liquidus NO3&#8211; and NO2&#8211;. Therefore, this work not only presents promising prospects for converting nitrogen oxides from exhaust gas and nitrate&#8208;laden waste water into high&#8208;value products, but also has significant implications for synthetizing amino acids in biomedical and catalytic science.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropene hydrofunctionalization has been a promising strategy for accessing multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes; however, cyclopropene hydroalkylation remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report a low&#8208;valent CoH&#8208;catalyzed facial&#8208;selective cyclopropene hydroalkylation to access multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope of alkyl halides and cyclopropenes and tolerates many functional groups. Moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good facial&#8208;selectivity is obtained without any directing groups. Mechanism studies provide evidence that alkyl radicals are generated from alkyl halides and irreversible CoH insertion is responsible for the facial&#8208;selectivity. Our preliminary exploration demonstrates that asymmetric cyclopropene hydroalkylation can be realized without conspicuous auxiliary groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Asymmetrical Dual Jahn&#8211;Teller Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) expresses great attraction to convert useless greenhouse gas into valuable chemical feedstock. However, the weak interactions between catalytic sites and PCR intermediates constrains the PCR activity and selectivity. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to match the intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and C1 intermediates by establishing dual Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) sites, in which, the strongly asymmetric J&#8211;T sites can break the nonpolar CO2 molecules and self&#8208;adapt the different structure of C1 intermediates. Taking cobalt carbonate hydroxide as an example, the weakly symmetric dual cobalt (Co2) J&#8211;T sites, weakly asymmetric Fe&amp;Co dual J&#8208;T sites and strongly asymmetric Cu&amp;Co dual J&#8208;T sites were assembled to investigate the modulation of PCR activity and selectivity. As a result, the Cu&amp;Co sites exhibited CO yield of 8137.9 &#956;mol g&#8208;1, about 2.3&#8208;fold and 4.2&#8208;fold higher than that of the Fe&amp;Co and Co2 sites within 5&#8208;hour photoreaction, respectively. In addition, the selectivity achieved as high as 92.62% than Fe&amp;Co (88.67%) and Co2 sites (55.33%). This work provides a novel design concept for the construction of dual J&#8211;T sites to regulate the catalytic activity and selectivity by stabilizing the reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling the Operation of Highly Compatible LiI&#8211;3&#8208;Hydroxypropionitrile Small&#8208;Molecule Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes in Lithium Metal Batteries via Stepped&#8208;Amorphization Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>Integrating the advantages of both inorganic ceramic and organic polymer solid&#8208;state electrolytes, small&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state electrolytes represented by LiI&#8211;3&#8208;hydroxypropionitrile (LiI&#8211;HPN) inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems possess good interfacial compatibility and high modulus. However, their lack of intrinsic Li+ conduction ability hinders potential application in lithium metal batteries until now, despite containing LiI phase component. Herein, inspired by evolution tendency of ionic conduction behaviors together with first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a stepped&#8208;amorphization strategy to break the Li+ conduction bottleneck of LiI&#8211;HPN. It involves three progressive steps of composition (LiI&#8208;content increasing), time (long&#8208;time standing), and temperature (high&#8208;temperature melting) regulations, to essentially construct small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with intensified amorphous degree, which realizes efficient conversion from an I&#8722; to Li+ conductor and improved conductivity. As a proof, the stepped&#8208;optimized LiI&#8211;HPN is successfully operated in lithium metal batteries cooperated with Li4Ti5O12 cathode to deliver considerable compatibility and stability over 250 cycles. This work not only clarifies the ionic conduction mechanisms of LiI&#8211;HPN inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems, but also provides a reasonable strategy to broadens the application scenarios of highly compatible small&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Clusteroluminescence of Non&#8208;conjugated Phenolic Resins Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusteroluminescence (CL) and through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) of non&#8208;conjugated molecules have drawn more attention due to their unique photophysical behaviors that are different from largely conjugated luminogens. However, achieving red and even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission from such systems is still challenging due to the intrinsic drawbacks of non&#8208;conjugated molecules and the lack of theories for structure&#8208;property relationships. In this work, six phenolic resins are designed and synthesized based on two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing groups. All phenolic resins are verified as luminogens with CL property (CLgens), and the first example of CLgens with NIR emission (maximum emission wavelength &#8805; 680 nm) and high absolute quantum yield (47%) is reported. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal that two TSIs types, through&#8208;space locally excited state and through&#8208;space charge transfer state, play essential roles in achieving CL from these non&#8208;conjugated polymers, which could be manipulated via changing structural conformation and electron density or altering electron transition behaviors. This work not only provides an approach to manipulate TSIs and CL of non&#8208;conjugated polymers but also endows commercially available phenolic resins with high practical value as luminescence materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clusteroluminescence (CL) and through-space interactions (TSIs) of non-conjugated molecules have drawn more attention due to their unique photophysical behaviors that are different from largely conjugated luminogens. However, achieving red and even near-infrared (NIR) emission from such systems is still challenging due to the intrinsic drawbacks of non-conjugated molecules and the lack of theories for structure-property relationships. In this work, six phenolic resins are designed and synthesized based on two molecule-engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing electron-donating/-withdrawing groups. All phenolic resins are verified as luminogens with CL property (CLgens), and the first example of CLgens with NIR emission (maximum emission wavelength &#8805; 680 nm) and high absolute quantum yield (47%) is reported. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal that two TSIs types, through-space locally excited state and through-space charge transfer state, play essential roles in achieving CL from these non-conjugated polymers, which could be manipulated via changing structural conformation and electron density or altering electron transition behaviors. This work not only provides an approach to manipulate TSIs and CL of non-conjugated polymers but also endows commercially available phenolic resins with high practical value as luminescence materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Atom Bi Decorated Copper Alloy Enables C&#8208;C Coupling for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 into C2+&#160;Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have been recently explored&#160;for promotion of various heterogeneous catalysis, but it remains unexplored for selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products involving C&#8208;C coupling. Herein we report a single&#8208;atomic Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) electrocatalyst that could effectively modulate selectivity of CO2 reduction into C2+ products instead of previous C1 ones. The BiCu&#8208;SAA catalyst exhibits remarkably superior selectivity of C2+ products with optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.4% compared to the pure copper nanoparticle or Bi nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Cu nanocomposites, and its structure and performance can be well maintained at current density of 400 mA cm&#8208;2 under the flow cell system. Based on our in&#8208;situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the BiCu&#8208;SAA is found to favor the activation of CO2 and subsequent C&#8208;C coupling during the electrocatalytic reaction, as should be responsible for its extraordinary C2+ selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Encapsulating Lithium Polysulfide Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are regarded as promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries is restricted by the parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating LiPS electrolyte (EPSE) can efficiently suppress the parasitic reactions but inevitably sacrifices the cathode sulfur redox kinetics. To address the above dilemma, a redox comediation strategy for EPSE is proposed to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries. Concretely, dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe) is employed as an efficient redox comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics in Li&#8211;S batteries with EPSE. DMDSe enhances the liquid&#8211;liquid and liquid&#8211;solid conversion kinetics of LiPS in EPSE while maintains the ability to alleviate the anode parasitic reactions from LiPSs. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S pouch cell with a high energy density of 359 Wh kg&#8722;1 at cell level and stable 37 cycles is realized. This work provides an effective redox comediation strategy for EPSE to simultaneously achieve high energy density and long cycling stability in Li&#8211;S batteries and inspires rational integration of multi&#8208;strategies for practical working batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Emergence of a Lanthanide Chalcogenide as an Ideal Scintillator for a Flexible X&#8208;ray Detector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors requires scintillators with fast decay time, high light yield, stability, and X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, which are difficult to achieve in a single material. Here, we present the first example of a lanthanide chalcogenide of LaCsSiS4:1%Ce3+ that simultaneously integrates multiple desirable properties for an ideal scintillator. LaCsSiS4:1%Ce3+ demonstrates a remarkably low detection limit of 43.13 nGyair/s and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.24%, resulting in a high light yield of 50480 &#177; 1441 photons/MeV. Notably, LaCsSiS4:1%Ce3+ exhibits a fast decay time of only 29.35 &#177; 0.16 ns, making it one of the fastest scintillators among all lanthanide&#8208;based inorganic scintillators. Furthermore, this material shows robust radiation and moisture resistance, endowing it with suitability for chemical processing under solution conditions. To demonstrate the X&#8208;ray imaging capacity of LaCsSiS4:1%Ce3+, we fabricated a flexible X&#8208;ray detector that achieved a high spatial resolution of 8.2 lp/mm. This work highlights the potential of lanthanide chalcogenide as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Pnictogen Interactions with Nitrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular rotors were designed to experimentally measure the transition state stabilizing abilities of nitrogen pnictogen interactions. The rotors formed intramolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions in the bond rotation transition states. Many common nitrogen functional groups were observed to form stabilizing interactions including amides, imines, and nitro groups.







Abstract
Stabilizing nitrogen pnictogen bond interactions were measured using molecular rotors. Intramolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions were formed in the bond rotation transition states which lowered the rotational barriers and increased the rates of rotation, as measured by EXSY NMR. The pnictogen interaction energies show a very strong correlation with the positive electrostatic potential on nitrogen, which was consistent with a strong electrostatic component. In contrast, the NBO perturbation and pyramidalization analyses show no correlation, suggesting that the orbital&#8208;orbital component is minor. The strongest C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N pnictogen interactions were comparable to C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions and were stronger than C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph interactions, when measured using the same N&#8208;phenylimide rotor system. The ability of the nitrogen pnictogen interactions to stabilize transition states and enhance kinetic processes demonstrates their potential in catalysis and reaction design.

         <dc:description>Pursuing high power density lithium metal battery with high safety is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices, but uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequence formed unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) make the task really challenging. Herein, an ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes, showing superior room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 and Li+ transfer number of 0.82. The cryo&#8208;TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li3N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li//LiFePO4 and Li//NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.</dc:description>

Despite the ubiquity of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases in microorganisms, their three&#8208;dimensional structures have never been experimentally determined. Herein, we focused on AdrI, the Pyr4&#8208;family enzyme for the andrastin A pathway, and its homologues, and performed a series of mutational experiments using their AlphaFold2&#8208;generated structures. Intriguingly, we found that AdrI and InsA7, which both accept the same substrate, use different amino acid residues for the initiation of the cyclization cascade. Furthermore, we obtained several AdrI variants with altered product selectivity, one of which dominantly yielded a new meroterpenoid species. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the catalytic functions of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases and will facilitate the engineering of these enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Arylation of Racemic Secondary Benzylic Alcohols to Access Enantioenriched  &#946;&#8208;Arylated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of alcohols into value&#8208;added products is of great importance, as simple alcohols are widespread and can be easily derived from both fossil fuels and biomass. The selective functionalization of a sp3 C&#8208;H bond on the alkyl side chain of an alcohol over its hydroxyl group would offer an expedient route to expand the chemical space of alcohols but it remains a challenging task. Harnessing the borrowing hydrogen strategy, the &#946;&#8208;arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been achieved in this study, which allows for the selective functionalization of a &#946;&#8208;Csp3&#8208;H bond in an alcohol substrate. Under the catalysis of a Pd complex, secondary alcohols reacted with aryl bromides to afford 1,2&#8208;diaryl alcohols with broad substrate scope in the presence of a ketone additive. Furthermore, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized, transforming racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral 1,2&#8208;diaryl alcohols under the cooperative Pd and Ru catalysis. Mechanism studies indicate that the reactions are enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal is a promising anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries but suffers from low stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency and dendritic growth particularly at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, a poorly&#8208;flammable, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte with a wide liquidus range extending well below 0 &#176;C is proposed for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries. Its all&#8208;anion Li+ solvation and phase&#8208;nano&#8208;segregation solution structure are sustained at low temperatures, which, together with a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic compounds, enable dendrite&#8208;free operation of lithium metal anodes at &#8208;20 &#176;C and 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.9%. As a result, lithium metal batteries coupling thin lithium metal anodes (4 mAh cm&#8208;2) and high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathodes (10 mg cm&#8208;2) retain 70% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles at &#8208;20 &#176;C. These results, as a proof of concept, demonstrate the applicability of locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Bilayer&#8208;Coating Strategy for Hydrophobic Nanoparticles Providing Colloidal Stability, Functionality, and Surface Protection in Biological Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface chemistry of nanoparticles is a key step on the pathway from particle design towards applications in biologically relevant environments. Here, a bilayer&#8208;based strategy for the surface modification of hydrophobic nanoparticles is introduced that leads to excellent colloidal stability in aqueous environments and good protection against disintegration, while permitting surface functionalization via simple carbodiimide chemistry. We have demonstrated the excellent potential of this strategy using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), initially coated with oleate and therefore dispersible only in organic solvents. The hydrophobic oleate capping is maintained and a bilayer is formed upon addition of excess oleate. The bilayer approach renders protection towards luminescence loss by water quenching, while the incorporation of additional molecules containing amino functions yields colloidal stability and facilitates the introduction of functionality. The biological relevance of the approach was confirmed with the use of two model dyes, a photosensitizer and a nitric oxide (NO) probe that, when attached to the surface of the UCNPs, retained their functionality to produce singlet oxygen and detect intracellular NO, respectively. We present a simple and fast strategy to protect and functionalize inorganic nanoparticles in biological media, which is important for controlled surface engineering of nanosized materials for theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of the Ethyl Radical in the Pyrolysis of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first direct detection of ethyl radical in the pyrolysis of ethane. Observation of this vital intermediate was made possible in this extremely reactive environment by the use of a microreactor coupled with synchrotron radiation and&#160; photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, despite its short lifetime and low concentration. Together with ab initio&#160;master equation calculated rates and fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations, our measurements show that even under the low pressures and short residence times in our experiment, ethyl formation can only be explained by bimolecular reactions; the most important is the catalytic attack of ethane by H atoms, which are then regenerated by decomposition of the nascent ethyl radicals.&#160; Our results complete the observation of all hypothesized intermediates in this industrially important process, and highlight the need for further studies under additional conditions using similar methods to improve existing models and optimize process chemistries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photosynthesis, solar energy is harvested by photosensitizers, and then, the excited electrons transfer via a Z&#8208;scheme mode to enzymatic catalytic centers to trigger redox reactions. Herein, we constructed a core&#8208;shell Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction of semiconductor@single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO core and single&#8208;atom Co&#8208;N4 sites supported on nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon shell (SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN) act as the photosensitizer and the enzyme&#8208;mimicking active centers, respectively. Driven by built&#8208;in electric field across the heterojunction, photoexcited electrons could rapidly (2 ps) transfer from the n&#8208;type ZnO core to the p&#8208;type SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN shell, finally boosting the catalytic performance of the surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;atom Co&#8208;N4 sites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under light irradiation. The synergies between photocatalysis and heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction lead to phenomenally enhanced production of various reactive oxygen species for rapid degradation of various microcontaminants in water. Experimental and theoretical results validate that the interfacial coupling of SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN with ZnO greatly facilitates PMS adsorption and activation by reducing the adsorption energy and enhancing the cascade electron transfer processes for the photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemical Proteomic Strategy Reveals Inhibitors of Lipoate Salvage in Bacteria and Parasites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel anti&#8208;infectives requires unprecedented strategies targeting pathways which are solely present in pathogens but absent in humans. Following this principle, we developed inhibitors of lipoic acid (LA) salvage, a crucial pathway for the survival of LA auxotrophic bacteria and parasites but non&#8208;essential in human cells. An LA&#8208;based probe was selectively transferred onto substrate proteins via lipoate protein ligase (LPL) in intact cells, and their binding sites were determined by mass spectrometry. Probe labeling served as a proxy of LPL activity, enabling in&#8208;situ screenings for cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors. Profiling a focused compound library revealed two substrate analogs (LAMe and C3) as inhibitors, which were further validated by binding studies and co&#8208;crystallography. Importantly, LAMe exhibited low toxicity in human cells and achieved killing of Plasmodium&#160;falciparum in erythrocytes with an EC50 value of 15&#160;&#181;M, making it the most effective LPL inhibitor reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Production of Multivariate, Hyperdimensional End Group and Main Chain Functionalized Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The (stereoselective) living coordinative copolymerization of 1&#8208;alkenes with 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,6&#8208;heptadienes, in both the absence and presence of multiple equivalents of a reversible chain transfer agent, is established as a highly versatile strategy for production of multivariate hyperdimensional functionalized semi&#8208;crystalline or amorphous polyolefins that optionally possess either mono&#8208; or difunctionalized (telechelic) end&#8208;groups in combination with a programmable level of incorporation of orthogonal functional groups within the main&#8208;chain. The non&#8208;conjugated diene comonomers are readily obtained from a diverse range of aryl carboxaldehyde precursors through a one&#8208;step bis&#8208;allylation process. These results serve to provide a new platform for exploring the science and technology of a vast new landscape of functionalized classes of polyolefins that are now accessible in practical and scalable quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In NMR spectroscopy, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have emerged as one of the most exquisite probes of biological structure and dynamics. The measurement of RDCs relies on the partial alignment of the molecule of interest, for example by using a liquid crystal as a solvent. Here, we establish bacterial type 1 pili as an alternative liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of RDCs. To achieve alignment at pilus concentrations that allow for efficient NMR sample preparation, we elongated wild&#8208;type pili by recombinant overproduction of the main structural pilus subunit. Building on the extraordinary stability of type 1 pili against spontaneous dissociation and unfolding, we show that the medium is compatible with challenging experimental conditions such as high temperature, the presence of detergents, organic solvents or very acidic pH, setting it apart from most established alignment media. Using human ubiquitin, HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and camphor as spectroscopic probes, we demonstrate the applicability of the medium for the determination of RDCs of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Our results show that type 1 pili represent a very useful alternative to existing alignment media and may readily assist the characterization of molecular structure and dynamics by NMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of [15N3]Metronidazole: a Clinical Approved Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) of [15N3]metronidazole ([15N3]MNZ) for the first time. Metronidazole is a clinically approved antibiotic, which can be potentially employed as a hypoxia&#8208;sensing molecular probe using&#160;15N hyperpolarized (HP) nucleus. DNP process is very efficient for [15N3]MNZ with an exponential build&#8208;up constant of 13.8 min using trityl radical. After dissolution and sample transfer to a nearby 4.7 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, HP [15N3]MNZ lasted remarkably long with&#160;T1&#160;values up to 343 s and&#160;15N polarizations up to 6.4%. A time series of HP [15N3]MNZ images was acquired&#160;in&#8208;vitro&#160;using a&#160;steady state free precession sequence&#160;on the&#160;15NO2peak. The signal lasted over 13 min with notably long&#160;T2&#160;of 20.5 s. HP [15N3]MNZ was injected in the tail vein of a healthy rat, and dynamic spectroscopy was performed over the rat brain. The&#160;in&#8208;vivo&#160;HP&#160;15N signals persisted over 70 s, demonstrating an unprecedented opportunity for&#160;in&#8208;vivo&#160;studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneously Blinking Rhodamine Dyes for Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has found extensive applications in various fields of biology and chemistry. As a vital component of SMLM, fluorophores play an essential role in obtaining super&#8208;resolution fluorescence images. Recent research on spontaneously blinking fluorophores has greatly simplified the experimental setups and extended the imaging duration of SMLM. To support this crucial development, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the development of spontaneously blinking rhodamines from 2014 to 2023, as well as the key mechanistic aspects of intramolecular spirocyclization reactions. We hope that by offering insightful design guidelines, this review will contribute to accelerating the advancement of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress on Electrode Design for Efficient Electrochemical Valorisation of CO2, O2, and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2&#160;reduction, two&#8208;electron&#160;O2&#160;reduction, and&#160;N2&#160;reduction are sustainable technologies to valorise common molecules. Their further development requires working electrode design to promote the multistep electrochemical processes from gas reactants to value&#8208;added products at the device level. This review proposes critical features of a desirable electrode based on the fundamental electrochemical processes and the development of scalable devices. A detailed discussion is made to approach such a desirable electrode, addressing the recent progress on critical electrode components, assembly strategies, and reaction interface engineering. Further, we highlight the electrode design tailored to reaction properties (e.g., its thermodynamics and kinetics) for performance optimisation. Finally, the opportunities and remaining challenges are presented, providing a framework for rational electrode design to push these gas reduction reactions towards an improved technology readiness level (TRL).</dc:description>
