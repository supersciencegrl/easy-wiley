         <title>Tracking the Impact of Koch&#8208;Carbonylated Organics During the Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyzed Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complementary research strategy (involving catalysis, operando UV/Vis, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) bridges the mechanistic gap between Koch&#8208;type carbonylation&#8208;led direct and dual cycle mechanisms during the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process.







Abstract
A methanol&#8208;based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, the practical application of this process in a CO2&#8208;neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch&#8208;carbonylation&#8208;led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady&#8208;state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV/Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic&#8208;based investigations on the MTH process, involving co&#8208;feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch&#8208;carbonylated species), including selective isotope&#8208;labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch&#8722;)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side&#8208;chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene&#8208;toluene&#8208;xylene) primarily.

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular assembly can be designed by fusing binding domains. A precise optimization of the level of compaction of the assembly using linker of different lengths or compositions can provide a simple strategy to program their assembly properties (e.g., midpoint, dynamic range, and inhibition). The thermodynamic and mechanistic principles demonstrated herein also shine light behind the evolution of biological molecular assembly.







Abstract
Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50&#8197;years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;mimetic Engineered Protein Fibers with High Toughness and Minimized Batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch Variations through &#946;&#8208;sheets Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin&#8208;mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C&#8208;terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;&#8208;sheets modules, and a non&#8208;spidroin random&#8208;coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200 MJ/m3, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability in the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high&#8208;performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation over bicomponent catalysts through hydrogen spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation under mild conditions is a more attractive approach for alkene production than industrial routes but suffers from either low production efficiency or high energy consumption. Here, we describe a tandem catalytic concept that overcomes these challenges. Component (i), which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with component (ii), which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on component (i) at low overpotentials and timely (i)&#8208;to&#8208;(ii) hydrogen spillover and facile desorptive hydrogenation on component (ii). We examine this concept over bicomponent palladium&#8208;copper catalysts for the production of representative 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) from 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyne&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) and achieve a record high MBE production rate of 1.44 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faraday efficiency of ~88.8 % at a low energy consumption of 1.26 kWh kgMBE&#8722;1. With these catalysts, we further achieve 60 h continuous production of MBE with record high profit space.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Iron Homeostasis: Iron Capturing Nanocomposites for Combating Bacterial Biofilm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the scarcity of novel antibiotics, the eradication of bacterial biofilm infections poses formidable challenges. Upon bacterial infection, the host restricts Fe ions, which are crucial for bacterial growth and maintenance. Having coevolved with the host, bacteria developed adaptive pathways like the hemin&#8208;uptake system to avoid iron deficiency. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy, termed iron nutritional immunity therapy (INIT), utilizing Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites constructed with gallium, copper&#8208;doped tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) metal&#8208;organic framework, and polyamine&#8208;amine polymer dots, to target bacterial iron intakes and starve them. Owing to the similarity between iron/hemin and gallium/TCPP, gallium&#8208;incorporated porphyrin potentially deceives bacteria into uptaking gallium ions and concurrently extracts iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu through the porphyrin ring. This strategy orchestrates a "give and take" approach for Ga3+/Fe3+ exchange. Simultaneously, polymer dots can impede bacterial iron metabolism and serve as real&#8208;time fluorescent iron&#8208;sensing probes to continuously monitor dynamic iron restriction status. INIT based on Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites induced long&#8208;term iron starvation, which affected iron&#8208;sulfur cluster biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism, ultimately facilitating biofilm eradication and tissue regeneration. Therefore, this study presents an innovative antibacterial strategy from a nutritional perspective that sheds light on refractory bacterial infection treatment and its future clinical application.</dc:description>

Therefore, this study presents an innovative antibacterial strategy from a nutritional perspective that sheds light on refractory bacterial infection treatment and its future clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Repaired g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets: Elevating the Efficacy of Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Through Enhanced Charge Carrier Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has garnered growing interest owing to its high tissue penetration depth and minimal side effects. However, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers remains the primary limiting factor for the clinical application of this treatment method. Here, defect&#8208;repaired graphene phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) nanosheets are prepared and utilized for enhanced SDT in anti&#8208;tumor treatment. After defect engineering optimization, the bulk defects of g&#8208;C3N4 are significantly reduced, resulting in higher crystallinity and exhibiting a polyheptazine imide (PHI) structure. Due to the more extended conjugated structure of PHI, facilitating faster charge transfer on the surface, it exhibits superior SDT performance for inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. This work focuses on introducing a novel carbon nitride nanomaterial as a sonosensitizer and a strategy for optimizing sonosensitizer performance by reducing bulk defects.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over  a Covalent Organic Framework in the Presence of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we propose an oxygen&#8208;containing species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2. A conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF), denoted as NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that is composed of the Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) unit &#160;and the salen(Co)2 moiety with binuclear Co&#8208;N2O2 sites, is developed and synthesized for enhancing the CO2RR under aerobic condition. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from ORR could decrease the energy barrier of the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center. Thus, NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF exhibits high oxygen&#8208;tolerant CO2RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.2% at &#8208;1.0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8211;1.1 V in the presence of 0.5% O2, which is superior to that in pure CO2 feed gas (FECO = 94.8%, jCO = 19.9 mA cm&#8211;2). Notably, the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 128.3 mA cm&#8211;2 in the flow&#8208;cell reactor with 0.5% O2 at &#8208;0.8 V, which is higher than that in pure CO2 atmosphere (jCO = 104.8 mA cm&#8211;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Rod&#8208;Coil Bottlebrush Copolymers into Degradable Nanodiscs with a UV&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Immolation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer nanodiscs, especially with stimuli&#8208;responsive features, represent an unexplored frontier in the nanomaterial landscape. Such 2D nanomaterials are however considered highly promising for advanced biomedicine applications. Herein, we designed a coil&#8208;rod copolymer architecture based on an amphiphilic, tadpole&#8208;like bottlebrush copolymer, which can directly self&#8208;assemble into core&#8208;shell nanodiscs in an aqueous environment. As the bottlebrush side chains are made of amorphous, UV&#8208;responsive poly (ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) chains, they can undergo rapid end&#8208;to&#8208;end self&#8208;immolation upon light irradiation. This triggered nanodisc disassembly can be used to boost small molecule release from the nanodisc core which is further aided by a morphological change from discs to spheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Mannosylated Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA Cancer Vaccine with High Antigen Presentation Efficiency and Immunomodulatory Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insufficient accumulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based mRNA vaccines in antigen presenting cells remains a key barrier to eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Herein, we develop dendritic cells (DCs) targeting LNPs by taking advantage of mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Efficient delivery of mRNA to DCs is achieved in vitro and in vivo utilizing the sweet LNPs (STLNPs&#8208;Man). Intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccine (STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA) results in a four&#8208;fold higher uptake by DCs in comparison with commercially used LNPs. Benefiting from its DCs targeting ability, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA significantly promotes the antitumor performances, showing a comparable therapeutic efficacy by using one&#8208;fifth of the injection dosage as the vaccine prepared from normal LNPs, thus remarkably avoiding the side effects brought by conventional mRNA vaccines. More intriguingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells due to the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis, showing brilliant potentials in promoting antitumor efficacy combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion through Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological phase transition, mediated by oxygen vacancies, is discovered in free&#8208;standing Ni&#8208;Co oxides supported on graphene aerogel. This phase transition introduces NiCoO2/NiCo2O4 heterojunction in the surface region, thus improving the catalytic activity thanks to a strong internal electric field and gradient oxygen vacancies. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 and desorption of *CO intermediates, resulting in an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Weak adsorption of gas reactants and strong binding of intermediates present a significant challenge for most transition metal oxides, particularly in the realm of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we demonstrate that the adsorption can be fine&#8208;tuned by phase engineering of oxide catalysts. An oxygen vacancy mediated topological phase transition in Ni&#8208;Co oxide nanowires, supported on a hierarchical graphene aerogel (GA), is observed from a spinel phase to a rock&#8208;salt phase. Such in situ phase transition empowers the Ni&#8208;Co oxide catalyst with a strong internal electric field and the attainment of abundant oxygen vacancies. Among a series of catalysts, the in situ transformed spinel/rock&#8208;salt heterojunction supported on GA stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, yielding an impressive CO production rate of 12.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 96.5&#8201;%. This remarkable performance is a result of the robust interfacial coupling between two topological phases that optimizes the electronic structures through directional charge transfer across interfaces. The phase transition process induces more Co2+ in octahedral site, which can effectively enhance the Co&#8208;O covalency. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 molecules and desorption of reaction intermediates, thereby lowering the energetic barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Chemically Transformed Ag2Te Nanowires on Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane For Flexible Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible thermoelectric generator is prepared from chemically transformed Ag2Te nanowires, which are prepared from tellurium nanowires, for low power wearable and flexible electronic devices.







Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices of nanomaterials have shown a great potential for applications in wearable to remotely located electronics with desired shapes and geometries. Continuous powering up the low power flexible electronics is a major challenge.

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core&#8208;Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;expanded [10]annulene analog was synthesized and oxidized to its cationic states. These compounds exhibit notable structural flexibility, allowing for topological twisting. The dication displays a simultaneous presence of singly twisted and planar isomers within the crystal structure, distinguished by M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively. The tetracation shows H&#252;ckel aromaticity and open shell diradical nature.







Abstract
The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both 1 and its tetracation (14+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4SbF6&#8722;) exhibit a nearly planar conformation with a rectangular shape, akin to the E,Z,E,Z,Z&#8208;[10]annulene. In contrast, the radical cation (1&#8901;+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SbCl6&#8722;) possesses a doubly twisted H&#252;ckel topology. Furthermore, the dication (12+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722;) displays conformational flexibility in solution and crystalizes with the simultaneous presence of M&#246;bius&#8208;twisted (1a2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722;) and H&#252;ckel&#8208;planar (1b2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722;) isomers in its unit cell. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: (1) 1 demonstrates localized aromaticity with an alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure; (2) 1a2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722; and 1b2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722; with 48&#960; electrons are weakly M&#246;bius aromatic and H&#252;ckel antiaromatic, respectively; (3) 14+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4SbF6&#8722; exhibits H&#252;ckel aromaticity (46&#960;) and open&#8208;shell diradical character.

         <title>Modifying the Oxidative Potentials of Imines in a Dye Loaded Capsule for Photocatalytic Cyclization with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the confinement effect of the host&#8208;dye photocatalytic system to shift the redox potentials of substrate, the isomerization and thermodynamic activation of substrate were achieved, which were followed by a multiphoton excitation enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Modifying redox potential of substrates and intermediates to balance pairs of redox steps are important stages for multistep photosynthesis but faced marked challenges. Through co&#8208;clathration of iridium photosensitizer and imine substrate within one packet of a metal&#8208;organic capsule to shift the redox potentials of substrate, herein, we reported a multiphoton enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings. The cage facilitated a pre&#8208;equilibrium substrate&#8208;involving clathrate that cathodic shifts the oxidation potential of the substrate&#8208;dye&#8208;host ternary complex and configuration inversion of substrate via spatial constraints in the confined space. The new two photon excitation strategy enabled the precise control of the multistep electron transfer between each pair (photosensitizer, substrate and the capsule), endowing the catalytic system proceeding smoothly with an enzymatic fashion. Three kinds of 2&#8208;subsituted (&#8722;OH, &#8722;NH2, and &#8722;SH) imines and N&#8208;aryl enamines all give the corresponding cyclization products efficiently under visible light irradiation, demonstrating the promising of the microenvironment driven thermodynamic activation in the host&#8208;dye&#8208;substrate ternary for synergistic combination of multistep photocatalytic transformations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two simple structure and highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks (CNPz and DCNPz) were synthesized and incorporated into polymer backbone. P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show unipolar electron mobilities of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in OTFTs, respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, these two polymers exhibit electrical conductivities and power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is essential to accelerate the application of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). To achieve this objective, it is critical to design strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthesis, which are essential for the development of n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Herein, we synthesized two cyano&#8208;functionalized highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 3,6&#8208;dibromopyrazine&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitrile (CNPz) and 3,6&#8208;Dibromopyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile (DCNPz), which feature simple structures and facile synthesis. CNPz and DCNPz can be obtained via only one&#8208;step reaction and three&#8208;step reactions from cheap raw materials, respectively. Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) polymers, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is obtained for P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz), respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show high n&#8208;type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, respectively. Hence, the cyano&#8208;functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low&#8208;cost and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient building block for constructing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) polymers, P(DPP-CNPz) and P(DPP-DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep-positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n-type organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained for P(DPP-CNPz) and P(DPP-DCNPz), respectively. When doped with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-DMBI, P(DPP-CNPz) and P(DPP-DCNPz) show high n-type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/41.4&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/30.4&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Hence, the cyano-functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low-cost and readily accessible electron-deficient building block for constructing n-type polymer semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Anion Zinc Salt Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel zinc salt (Zn(DFTFSI)2) with an asymmetric structure anion group DFTFSI&#8722;, to enable a high ionic conductivity and engender in situ formation of a robust layer&#8208;structured SEI layer via easy decomposition of the asymmetric DFTFSI&#8722;. This robust SEI layer can quickly transfer Zn2+ ions, restrain dendrite growth, and suppress over 90&#8201;% hydrogen production, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.







Abstract
Organic additives with high&#8208;reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low&#8208;concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&#8208;)&#8208;based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&#8722; in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer&#8208;structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn
Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &gt;2500&#8197;h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn
Br2 battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200&#8197;cycles at ~99.8&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn
Br2 battery (~5.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8208;2), cycling over 320&#8197;cycles with 95.3&#8201;% initial capacity retained.

&lt;p&gt;Organic additives with high-reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low-concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)-based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite-free Zn anode.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Chemiluminophore for High&#8208;Contrast Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mMB, as a novel self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecule enabling photon sensitization, chemical defect formation, and afterglow generation, possessed a NIR afterglow chemiluminescence with a higher brightness and a NIR fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic signal. By introducing a responsive unit on the phenothiazine ring, it was tailored for ultrasensitive imaging of biomarkers with a superior activation ratio, enabling in vivo versatile imaging with high SBRs.







Abstract
Afterglow imaging holds great promise for ultrasensitive bioimaging due to its elimination of autofluorescence. Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs), which enable all&#8208;in&#8208;one photon sensitization, chemical defect formation and afterglow generation, possess a simplified, reproducible, and efficient superiority over commonly used multi&#8208;component systems. However, there is a lack of SAMs, particularly those with much brighter near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and structural flexibility for building high&#8208;contrast activatable imaging probes. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports a methylene blue derivative&#8208;based self&#8208;sustaining afterglow agent (SAN&#8208;M) with brighter NIR afterglow chemiluminescence peaking at 710&#8197;nm. By leveraging the structural flexibility and tunability, an activatable nanoprobe (SAN&#8208;MO) is customized for simultaneously activatable fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic and afterglow imaging of peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;), notably with a superior activation ratio of 4523 in the afterglow mode, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than other reported activatable afterglow systems. By virtue of the elimination of autofluorescence and ultrahigh activation contrast, SAN&#8208;MO enables early monitoring of the LPS&#8208;induced acute inflammatory response within 30&#8197;min upon LPS stimulation and precise image&#8208;guided resection of tiny metastatic tumors, which is unattainable for fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Identification of Direct Anchoring Sites for Monoatomic Dispersion of Precious Metals (Pt, Pd, Ag) on CeO2 Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface of the reducible support (CeO2), rather than the defects on the surface, are the direct anchoring sites of active metals. Therefore, active metals (Ag, Pt and Pd, etc.) can be single&#8208;atom dispersed on the terminal hydroxyl&#8208;rich CeO2&#8722;NC support (CeO2 (100) surfaces).







Abstract
Monoatomic dispersion of precious metals on the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals is a highly practical approach for dramatically reducing the usage of precious metals while exploiting the unique properties of single&#8208;atom catalysts. However, the specific atomic sites for anchoring precious metal atoms on the CeO2 support and underlying chemical mechanism remain partially unknown. Herein, we show that the terminal hydroxyls on the (100) surface are the most stable sites for anchoring Ag atoms on CeO2, indicating that CeO2 nanocubes are the most efficient substrates to achieve monoatomic dispersion of Ag. Importantly, the newly identified chemical mechanism for single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom dispersion on CeO2 nanocubes appears to be generic and can thus be extended to other precious metals (Pt and Pd). In fact, our experiments also show that atomically dispersed Pt/Pd species exhibit morphology&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent CO selectivity in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nonbenzenoid Heteroacene Crystals Synthesized via In&#8208;Situ Embedding of Ladder Bipyrazinylenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals are synthesized via the in&#8208;situ embedding of ladder bipyrazinylenes (LBPys) on Au(111). Through the intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and give rise to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Precisely introducing topological defects is an important strategy in nanographene crystal engineering because defects can tune &#960;&#8208;electronic structures and control molecular assemblies. The synergistic control of the synthesis and assembly of nanographenes by embedding the topological defects to afford two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals on surfaces is still a great challenge. By in&#8208;situ embedding ladder bipyrazinylene (LBPy) into acene, the narrowest nanographene with zigzag edges, we have achieved the precise preparation of 2D nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals on Au(111). Through intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and lead to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds. Using bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we determined the atomic structures of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene product and diverse organometallic intermediates. The tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed the electronic structure of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed distinct organometallic intermediates during progression annealing combined with DFT calculations demonstrated that LBPy formation proceeds via electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides, trapping of heteroarynes by Au adatoms, and stepwise elimination of Au adatoms.

         <title>Back Cover: Intramolecular Triplet Diffusion Facilitates Triplet Dissociation in a Pentacene Hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in most covalent systems. In their Research Article (e202315064), Rik&#8197;R. Tykwinski, Dirk&#8197;M. Guldi et&#8197;al. present a hexameric pentacene system with strong inter&#8208;pentacene couplings, capable of undergoing rapid intramolecular singlet fission while, simultaneously, achieving considerably increased yields of free triplets. These typically contradictory observations have been attributed to intramolecular cluster formation, which orchestrates a diffusive spatial separation of triplet excitons from a coupling hotspot between a pair of particularly strongly&#8208;coupled pentacenes.

         <title>Anionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Showing Tautomerism and Colorful Luminescence for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tautomers coexisting in an equilibrium system have significant potential in regulating luminescent properties due to their structural differences. However, separating and stabilizing tautomers at room temperature is a considerable challenge. In this work, it is found that hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of Br&#8208; anionic can effectively separate and stabilize two proton&#8208;transfer tautomers of triarylformamidinium bromide: nitrogen cation (BA&#8208;N) and carbon cation (BA&#8208;C). BA&#8208;N crystal with dense anionic HOF and parallelly aligning organic cations exhibits green thermal activation delayed fluorescence and red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). BA&#8208;C crystal contains acetone molecules that induce antiparallel arrangement of organic cations to form loose HOF, producing blue prompt fluorescence and green RTP. Interestingly, the HOFs switching between BA&#8208;N and BA&#8208;C can be achieved through the inhalation and exhalation of acetone, thereby dynamically adjusting multiple luminescent behaviors. Consequently, the HOF crystals can be used in highly sensitive and specific acetone sensing with a detection limit of 66.74 ppm. This work not only stabilizes tautomeric luminescent materials at room temperature, but also provides a new method for constructing smart HOFs with sensitive stimulus response.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Construction and Structural Transformation of Homogeneous Linear Metalla[4]catenane and Metalla[2]catenane Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules has been extensively researched, selectively constructing homogeneous linear [4]catenanes remains a formidable challenge. Here, we selectively constructed a homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear half&#8208;sandwich rhodium precursor. The formation of metalla[4]catenanes was facilitated by cooperative interactions between strong sandwich&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds between the components. Moreover, by modulating the aromatic substituents on the binuclear precursor, two homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes were obtained. The molecular structures of these metallacatenanes were unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, reversible structural transformation between metal&#8208;catenanes and the corresponding metallarectangles could be achieved by altering their concentration, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering Photoelectronic and Photothermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis that rests on the ability of coupling localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and electrochemical activation, emerges as an intriguing and booming area. However, its development seriously suffers from the entanglement between the photoelectronic and photothermal effects induced by the decay of plasmons, especially under the influence of applied potential. Herein, using LSPR&#8208;mediated CO2 reduction on Ag electrocatalyst as a model system, we quantitatively uncover the dominant photoelectronic effect on CO2 reduction reaction over a wide potential window, in contrast to the leading photothermal effect on H2 evolution reaction at relatively negative potentials. The excitation of LSPR selectively enhances the CO faradaic efficiency (17&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6 VRHE) and partial current density (100&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6 VRHE), suppressing the undesired H2 faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) reveals a plasmon&#8208;promoted formation of the bridge&#8208;bonded CO on Ag surface via a carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate.&#160;The present work demonstrates a deep mechanistic understanding of selective regulation of interfacial reactions by coupling plasmons and electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Tethered Trimeric Small&#8208;molecular Acceptors through Aromatic&#8208;core engineering for Highly Efficient and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. In an effect to dynamically control morphology and tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein SMA subunits are connected to the aromatic&#8208;core via flexible chains, are proposed to afford an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to individual SMAs. However, achieving both higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and elevated Tg values presents a significant challenge for the design of tethered SMAs. In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core on the dimers and expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY&#8208;&#946;. This systematic aromatic&#8208;core engineering results in a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24%. More significantly, the trimer&#8208;based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability. Our findings underscore the promise and feasibility of trimeric structures in achieving highly ordered aggregation behavior and increased Tg value for high&#160;efficiency and thermal stable device.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Supported 2&#8208;Sila and 2&#8208;Germavinylidenes: Synthesis, Dynamics, First Reactivity and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (C=EH2; E = Si, Ge) are according to quantum chemical studies the least stable isomers on the [E,C,2H] potential energy hypersurface isomerizing easily via the trans&#8208;bent tetrelaacetylenes HE&#8801;CH to the thermodynamically most stable 1&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (E=CH2). Consequently, experimental studies on 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (C=ER2) are lacking. Herein we report experimental and theoretical studies of the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) supported 2&#8208;silavinylidene (NHC)C=SiBr(Tbb) (1&#8208;Si: NHC = C[N(Dipp)CH]2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Tbb = 2,6&#8208;bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) and the isovalent 2&#8208;germavinylidenes (NHC)C=GeBr(R) (1&#8208;Ge, 1&#8208;GeMind: R = Tbb, Mind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7&#8208;octamethyl&#8208;s&#8208;hydrindacene&#8208;4&#8208;yl)). The NHC&#8208;supported 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes were obtained from the 1,2&#8208;dibromoditetrelenes (E)&#8208;(R)BrE=EBr(R) using the diazoolefin (NHC)CN2 as vinylidene transfer reagent. 1&#8208;E (E = Si, Ge) have a planar vinylidene core, a bent&#8208;dicoordinated vinylidene carbon atom (CVNL), a very short E=CVNL bond and an almost orthogonal orientation of the NHC five&#8208;membered ring to the vinylidene core. Quantum chemical analysis of the electronic structures of 1&#8208;E suggest a significant bent 1&#8208;tetrelaallene and tetrelyne character. NMR studies shed light into the dynamics of 1&#8208;E involving NHC&#8208;rotation around the CVNL&#8722;CNHC bond with a low activation barrier. Furthermore, the synthetic potential of 1&#8208;E is demonstrated by the synthesis and full characterization of the unprecedented NHC&#8208;supported bromogermynes BrGe=C(EBr2Tbb)(NHC) (2&#8208;SiGe: E = Si; 2&#8208;GeGe: E = Ge).</dc:description>

Consequently, experimental studies on 2-tetrelavinylidenes (C=ER2) are lacking. Herein we report experimental and theoretical studies of the first N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) supported 2-silavinylidene (NHC)C=SiBr(Tbb) (1-Si: NHC = C[N(Dipp)CH]2, Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, Tbb = 2,6-bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-4-tert-butylphenyl) and the isovalent 2-germavinylidenes (NHC)C=GeBr(R) (1-Ge, 1-GeMind: R = Tbb, Mind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octamethyl-s-hydrindacene-4-yl)). The NHC-supported 2-tetrelavinylidenes were obtained from the 1,2-dibromoditetrelenes (E)-(R)BrE=EBr(R) using the diazoolefin (NHC)CN2 as vinylidene transfer reagent. 1-E (E = Si, Ge) have a planar vinylidene core, a bent-dicoordinated vinylidene carbon atom (CVNL), a very short E=CVNL bond and an almost orthogonal orientation of the NHC five-membered ring to the vinylidene core. Quantum chemical analysis of the electronic structures of 1-E suggest a significant bent 1-tetrelaallene and tetrelyne character. NMR studies shed light into the dynamics of 1-E involving NHC-rotation around the CVNL&#8722;CNHC bond with a low activation barrier. Furthermore, the synthetic potential of 1-E is demonstrated by the synthesis and full characterization of the unprecedented NHC-supported bromogermynes BrGe=C(EBr2Tbb)(NHC) (2-SiGe: E = Si; 2-GeGe: E = Ge).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt in Molecular Catalysts via Coordination Environment Regulation for Highly Efficient Heterogeneous Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia (NH3) is pivotal in modern industry and represents a promising next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy carrier. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) presents viable solutions for NH3 production and removal of ambient nitrate pollutants. However, the development of eNO3RR is hindered by lacking the efficient electrocatalysts. To address this challenge, we synthesized a series of macrocyclic molecular catalysts for the heterogeneous eNO3RR. These materials possess different coordination environments around metal centers by surrounding subunits. Consequently, electronic structures of the active centers can be altered, enabling tunable activity towards eNO3RR. Our investigation reveals that metal center with an N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration demonstrates superior activity over the others and achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90% within the tested range, where the highest FE of approximately 94% is obtained. Furthermore, it achieves a production rate of&#160;11.28 mg mgcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, and a turnover frequency of up to 3.28 s&#8208;1. Further tests disclose that these molecular catalysts with diverse coordination environments showed different magnetic moments. Theoretical calculation results indicate that variated coordination environments can result in a d&#8208;band center variation which eventually affects rate&#8208;determining step energy and calculated magnetic moments, thus establishing a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Controlled Synthesis of Oriented Quasi&#8208;Spherical CsPbBr3 Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled synthesis of lead&#8208;halide perovskite crystals is challenging yet attractive because of the pivotal role played by the crystal structure and growth conditions in regulating their properties. This study introduces data&#8208;driven strategies for the controlled synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, alongside an investigation into the synthesis mechanism. High&#8208;throughput rapid characterization of absorption spectra and color under ultraviolet illumination was conducted using 23 possible ligands for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 crystals. The links between the absorption spectra slope (difference in the absorbance at 400 nm and 450 nm divided by a wavelength interval of 50 nm) and crystal size were determined through statistical analysis of more than 100 related publications. Big data analysis and machine learning were employed to investigate a total of 688 absorption spectra and 652 color values, revealing correlations between synthesis parameters and properties. Ex&#8208;situ characterization confirmed successful synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 perovskites using polyvinylpyrrolidone and Acacia. Density functional theory calculations highlighted strong adsorption of Acacia on the (110) facet of CsPbBr3. Optical properties of the oriented quasi&#8208;spherical perovskites prepared with these data&#8208;driven strategies were significantly improved. This study demonstrates that data&#8208;driven controlled synthesis facilitates morphology&#8208;controlled perovskites with excellent optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;differential Imaging of Demethylated Metabolites of Methionine for Identifying&#160;Ferroptosis Regional Preferences with Path&#8208;independent Equifinal Fluorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regional preference of ferroptosis is key to the precise treatment of cancer. While in practice, the heterogenous metabolism of methionine (Met) and the random reactions with probe aggravates the challenges of both differential detection and precise regulation of ferroptosis. Herein, we synthesize the path&#8208;independent equifinal fluorescence probes for microenvironment&#8208;differential imaging of the demethylated metabolites of Met, and whereby develop a protocol to regulate regional ferroptosis towards the microenvironment preference. The probe features a smart redox&#8208;selective intermediate for discriminating microenvironments factors and an amount&#8208;selective moiety for the demethylated metabolites of Met. The resultant working logic matches well the differentiated demethylated metabolism of Met among diverse microenvironments. Even the ferroptosis causes oxidation of both microenvironment and Met, the synergistically enhanced contrast is achieved. With the probe, we realize the dynamic microenvironment&#8208;differential imaging in perivascular tissue. Notably, the ferroptosis condition caused the oxidation of Met and the decreased cysteine (Cys), which in return increased the ferroptosis. Accordingly, we develop a protocol of fluorescence imaging&#8208;differentiation analysis&#8208;chemical intervention to enable the regional regulation of ferroptosis. This work provides the first microenvironment&#8208;differential imaging of demethylated metabolites of Met and the regulation of regional preference, which will be constructive to the precise treatment of cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>An Intelligent DNA Nanoreactor for Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Read In Vivo Tumor Imaging and Precise Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) following an &#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm was constructed. iDNR exhibits superior stability, improved binding affinity, and superior targeting/retention capability. It addresses previous limitations such as always &#8220;ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, off&#8208;target effects, and high cost. Therefore, it enables the development of similar iDNRs for various biomedical applications.







Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;based in vivo tumor imaging and therapy have attracted extensive attention; however, they suffer from the unintelligent &#8220;always ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, substantial off&#8208;target effects, and high cost. Therefore, achieving in vivo easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging and precise therapy in a multi&#8208;parameter responsive and intelligent manner remains challenging. Herein, an intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) was constructed following the &#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm to address these issues. iDNR&#8208;mediated in situ deposition of photothermal substance polydopamine (PDA) can only be satisfied in tumor tissues with abundant membrane protein biomarkers &#8220;AND&#8221; hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, intelligent temperature&#8208;based in vivo easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging is realized without expensive instrumentation, and its diagnostic performance matches with that of flow cytometry, and photoacoustic imaging. Moreover, precise photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors could be achieved via intelligent heating of tumor tissues. The precise PTT of primary tumors in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy suppresses the growth of distant tumors and inhibits tumor recurrence. Therefore, highly programmable iDNR is a powerful tool for intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>A Catalytic Method to Activate Nitromethane by the Cooperation of Homo&#8208; and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic activation of bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2) enables the facile synthesis of amides and nitriles from ketone, aldehyde, and alkyne substrates. This method eliminates the need for stoichiometric reductants or activators, opening up new possibilities for MeNO2 as a nitrogen source in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The achievement of directly activating and utilizing bulk small molecules has remained a longstanding objective in the field of chemical synthesis. The present work reports a catalytic activation method for bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2). This method combines homogeneous Lewis acid with recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, featuring practicality, sustainability, and low cost, thus solving the inherent drawbacks of previous Nef processes where stoichiometric reductants or activators were required. By combining the advantages of both homo&#8208; and heterogeneous catalysts, this chemistry may not only offer new opportunities for the further development of MeNO2 as a nitrogen source for organic synthesis, but also promote the catalysis design in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Identification of Crucial Photosensitizing Factors to Promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of Ir(III)&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) were prepared as a molecular platform to identify the crucial factors to maximize the photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The dinuclear PS Ir&#8208;6 was over 54&#8197;times better than typical PS Ir&#8208;1 with a turnover number of up to 28160 under optimal conditions. Detailed investigations revealed that the incremental strong&#8208;visible&#8208;light absorption capacity by molecular structure&#8208;tuning is a crucial factor to boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The sensitizing ability of a catalytic system is closely related to the visible&#8208;light absorption ability, excited&#8208;state lifetime, redox potential, and electron&#8208;transfer rate of photosensitizers (PSs), however it remains a great challenge to concurrently mediate these factors to boost CO2 photoreduction. Herein, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based PSs (Ir&#8208;1&#8211;Ir&#8208;6) were prepared as molecular platforms to understand the interplay of these factors and identify the primary factors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Among them, less efficient visible&#8208;light absorption capacity results in lower CO yields of Ir&#8208;1, Ir&#8208;2 or Ir&#8208;4. Ir&#8208;3 shows the most efficient photocatalytic activity among these mononuclear PSs due to some comprehensive parameters. Although the Kobs of Ir&#8208;3 is &#8776;10&#8197;times higher than that of Ir&#8208;5, the CO yield of Ir&#8208;3 is slightly higher than that of Ir&#8208;5 due to the compensation of Ir&#8208;5&#8217;s strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing ability. Ir&#8208;6 exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance due to the strong visible&#8208;light absorption ability, comparable thermodynamic driving force, and electron transfer rate among these PSs. Remarkably, the CO2 photoreduction to CO with Ir&#8208;6 can achieve 91.5&#8197;&#956;mol, over 54&#8197;times higher than Ir&#8208;1, and the optimized TONC&#8208;1 can reach up to 28160. Various photophysical properties of the PSs were concurrently adjusted by fine ligand modification to promote CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Artificial Protein Crosstalk with a Molecule that Exchanges Binding Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule possessing binders for glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) acts as a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) capable of swapping binding partners. This sRU converts the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 into an activable enzyme that responds to the presence of an unnatural protein effector (LDHA). Consequently, the activity of GSK&#8208;3 becomes artificially dependent on the cellular hypoxic response.







Abstract
Drawing inspiration from allosteric signaling enzymes, whose catalytic and regulatory units are non&#8208;covalently linked, we have devised a method to establish unnatural, effector&#8208;mediated enzyme activation within native cells. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by introducing a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) onto glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) through non&#8208;covalent means. Our study reveals that this synthetic regulator mediates an unnatural crosstalk between GSK&#8208;3 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), whose expression is regulated by cellular oxygen levels. Specifically, with this approach, the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 is transformed into an activable enzyme, whereas LDHA is repurposed as an unnatural effector protein that controls the activity of the kinase, making it unnaturally dependent on the cell&#8216;s hypoxic response. These findings demonstrate a step toward imitating the function of effector&#8208;regulated cell&#8208;signaling enzymes, which play a key biological role in mediating the response of cells to changes in their environment. In addition, at the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle level, our results indicate the potential to develop a new class of protein inhibitors whose inhibitory effect in cells is dictated by the cell&#8216;s environment and consequent protein expression profile.

         <title>Anchoring Fe Species on the Highly Curved Surface of S and N Co&#8208;Doped Carbonaceous Nanosprings for Oxygen Electrocatalysis and a Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring Fe species on the highly curved surface of S and N co&#8208;doped carbonaceous nanosprings has been achieved (denoted as FeNS/Fe3C@CNS). FeNS/Fe3C@CNS exhibits high activities and stabilities in both alkaline and acidic medium. The excellent performance is attributed to the high curved surface and the incorporation of S that enhances the inherent catalytic activity of Fe single&#8208;atom active sites.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of critical significance in the advancement of fuel cells and zinc&#8208;air batteries. The iron&#8208;nitrogen (Fe&#8722;Nx) sites exhibited exceptional reactivity towards ORR. However, the task of designing and controlling the local structure of Fe species for high ORR activity and stability remains a challenge. Herein, we have achieved successful immobilization of Fe species onto the highly curved surface of S, N co&#8208;doped carbonaceous nanosprings (denoted as FeNS/Fe3C@CNS). The induction of this twisted configuration within FeNS/Fe3C@CNS arose from the assembly of chiral templates. For electrocatalytic ORR tests, FeNS/Fe3C@CNS exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#8197;V in alkaline medium and a E1/2 of 0.78&#8197;V in acidic medium. The Fe single atoms and Fe3C nanoparticles are coexistent and play as active centers within FeNS/Fe3C@CNS. The highly curved surface, coupled with S substitution in the coordination layer, served to reduce the energy barrier for ORR, thereby enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Fe single&#8208;atom sites. We also assembled a wearable flexible Zn&#8208;air battery using FeNS/Fe3C@CNS as electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the construction of highly curved surfaces within carbon materials, offering high electrocatalytic efficacy and remarkable performance for flexible energy conversion devices.

         <title>DNA Quadruplex Structure with a Unique Cation Dependency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrastranded DNA structure, KNa&#8208;quadruplex (KNaQ), is described. KNaQ forms from repetitive DNA sequences that are abundant in (parasitic) worms but extremely rare in humans or livestock. This opens a possibility of exploiting the fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique properties distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes and can be used to design novel recognition DNA elements/sensors.







Abstract
DNA quadruplex structures provide an additional layer of regulatory control in genome maintenance and gene expression and are widely used in nanotechnology. We report the discovery of an unprecedented tetrastranded structure formed from a native G&#8208;rich DNA sequence originating from the telomeric region of Caenorhabditis elegans. The structure is defined by multiple properties that distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes. Most notably, the formation of a stable so&#8208;called KNa&#8208;quadruplex (KNaQ) requires concurrent coordination of K+ and Na+ ions at two distinct binding sites. This structure provides novel insight into G&#8208;rich DNA folding under ionic conditions relevant to eukaryotic cell physiology and the structural evolution of telomeric DNA. It highlights the differences between the structural organization of human and nematode telomeric DNA, which should be considered when using C. elegans as a model in telomere biology, particularly in drug screening applications. Additionally, the absence/presence of KNaQ motifs in the host/parasite introduces an intriguing possibility of exploiting the KNaQ fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique shape and ion dependency and the possibility of controlling its folding by using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight ligands can be used for the design or discovery of novel recognition DNA elements and sensors.

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Human ALKBH3 Mediated RNA N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct RNA m1A substrate recognition and demethylation catalytic mechanisms of ALKBH3 were reported. It utilized a non&#8208;conserved &#946;&#8208;hairpin as well as two bubble regions inside the active pocket generated by two key residues Asp194 and Thr133 to achieve single stranded substrates preferential recognition and demethylation catalysis.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent post&#8208;transcriptional RNA modification, and the distribution and dynamics of the modification play key epitranscriptomic roles in cell development. At present, the human AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family member ALKBH3 is the only known mRNA m1A demethylase, but its catalytic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the structures of ALKBH3&#8208;oligo crosslinked complexes obtained with the assistance of a synthetic antibody crystallization chaperone. Structural and biochemical results showed that ALKBH3 utilized two &#946;&#8208;hairpins (&#946;4&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;5 and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;&#8242;&#8242;) and the &#945;2 helix to facilitate single&#8208;stranded substrate binding. Moreover, a bubble&#8208;like region around Asp194 and a key residue inside the active pocket (Thr133) enabled specific recognition and demethylation of m1A&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C)&#8208;modified substrates. Mutation of Thr133 to the corresponding residue in the AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family members FTO or ALKBH5 converted ALKBH3 substrate selectivity from m1A to N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A), as did Asp194 deletion. Our findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms of substrate recognition and m1A demethylation by ALKBH3. This study is expected to aid structure&#8208;guided design of chemical probes for further functional studies and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) consisting of a carbazole donor and a small amount of ionic acceptor have been realized. The polymer exhibits LPL without dopants and has higher phase stability than small molecule mixtures. The LPL can be observed even in air and at high temperatures&#160;below the glass transition temperature.







Abstract
Organic materials exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission in the near infrared are expected to have applications in bio&#8208;imaging and other areas. Although room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence display long&#8208;lived emission of approximately one minute, organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems with a similar emission mechanism to inorganic persistent emitters can emit for several hours at room temperature. In particular OLPL with a hole&#8208;diffusion mechanism can function even in the presence of oxygen. However, ionic materials lack long&#8208;term stability in neutral organic host owing to aggregation and phase separation. In this study, we synthesized polymers with stable near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence at room temperature via the copolymerization of electron donors and acceptors. The copolymers exhibit long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) at temperatures below the glass transition temperature and can be excited by approximately the entire range of visible light. LPL properties and spectra can be controlled by the dopant.

         <title>Rare Earth Evoked Subsurface Oxygen Species in Platinum Alloy Catalysts Enable Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, we have addressed the Pt degradation issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms. The Gd&#8722;O&#8722;Pt3Ni catalyst has achieved high mass activity and high durability simultaneously under low platinum group metal (PGM) loading in PEMFCs.







Abstract
Alleviating the degradation issue of Pt based alloy catalysts, thereby simultaneously achieving high mass activity and high durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), is highly challenging. Herein, we provide a new paradigm to address this issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms, thereby inhibiting Pt dissolution, through introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms. We have succeeded in introducing Gd&#8722;O dipoles into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, with direct spectral evidence attained from both soft and hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The higher rated power of 0.93&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and superior current density of 562.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;V than DOE target for heavy&#8208;duty vehicles in H2&#8208;air mode suggest the great potential of Gd&#8722;O&#8722;Pt3Ni towards practical application in heavy&#8208;duty transportation. Moreover, the mass activity retention (1.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) after 40&#8197;k cycles accelerated durability tests is even 2.4&#8197;times of the initial mass activity goal for DOE 2025 (0.44&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1), due to the weakened Pt&#8722;Oads bond interaction and the delayed place exchange process, via repulsive forces between surface O atoms and those in the sublayer. This work addresses the critical roadblocks to the widespread adoption of PEMFCs.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Hydrogen Production by Electrochemical&#8208;assisted Methanol Steam Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanol steam reforming (MSR) to hydrogen (H2) is seriously obstructed by the high reaction temperatures and complicated purification processes. We proposed an electrochemical&#8208;assisted methanol steam reforming (EMSR) method to achieve a high hydrogen production rate by coupling the electrochemical reaction within MSR in a polymer electrolyte membrane reactor at low temperatures.







Abstract
Methanol steam reforming (MSR) provides an alternative way for efficient production and safe transportation of hydrogen but requires harsh conditions and complicated purification processes. In this work, an efficient electrochemical&#8208;assisted MSR reaction for pure H2 production at lower temperature (~140&#8201;&#176;C) is developed by coupling the electrocatalysis reaction into the MSR in a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis reactor. By electrochemically assisted, the two critical steps including the methanol dehydrogenation and water&#8208;gas shift reaction are accelerated, which is attributed to decreasing the methanol dehydrogenation energy and promoting the dissociation of H2O to OH* by the applied potential. Furthermore, the reduced H2 partial pressure by the hydrogen oxidation and reduction process further promotes MSR. The combination of these advantages not only efficiently decreases the MSR temperature but also achieves the high rate of hydrogen production of 505&#8197;mmol&#8201;H2&#8201;g&#8201;Pt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with exceptionally high H2 selectivity (99&#8201;%) at 180&#8201;&#176;C and a low voltage (0.4&#8197;V), and the productivity is about 30&#8208;fold than that of traditional MSR. This study opens up a new avenue to design novel electrolysis cells for hydrogen production.

An atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical and redox&#8208;neutral cascade reaction enabled by dual&#8208;metal relay catalysis by merging borrowing&#8208;hydrogen and Michael addition reactions provided access to all stereoisomers of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid derivatives with 1,4&#8208;non&#8208;adjacent stereocenters. Concise stereodivergent synthesis of key intermediates for the synthesis of biologically important chiral molecules further showcases the synthetic utility of the approach.







Abstract
An atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical and redox&#8208;neutral cascade reaction enabled by asymmetric bimetallic relay catalysis by merging a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition has been realized. A variety of highly functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid esters or peptides bearing 1,4&#8208;non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers have been prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Judicious selection and rational modification of the Ru catalysts with careful tuning of the reaction conditions played a pivotal role in stereoselectivity control as well as attenuating undesired &#945;&#8208;epimerization, thus enabling a full complement of all four stereoisomers that were otherwise inaccessible in previous work. Concise asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis of the key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules further showcases the synthetic utility of this methodology.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian White (PW), yielding a promising cathode material (Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12 [Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H2O) for Na&#8208;ion battery applications. Comparison of the structural and chemical properties of high&#8208;, medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy Mn&#8208;based PWs reveals the performance benefits arising from increased configurational entropy, namely suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution during cycling.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na&#8208;ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn&#8208;based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N&#8208;coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H2O was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low&#8208;entropy and conventional single&#8208;metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high&#8208;symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high&#8208;entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Stable Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enables High&#8208;temperature, High&#8208;voltage Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin and uniform CEI with LiBxOy/LiF&#8208;rich outer layer and LiF&#8208;rich inner layer derived by TTFPB additive exhibits high thermostability and mechanical stability, which substantially mitigated the cracking and reconstruction of CEI and irreversible phase transition of the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage and high&#8208;operating temperature.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li||LiCoO2 batteries is severely limited by the instability of cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage and high temperature. Here we propose a mechanically and thermally stable CEI by electrolyte designing for achieving the exceptional performance of Li||LiCoO2 batteries at 4.6&#8197;V and 70&#8201;&#176;C. 2,4,6&#8208;tris(3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)boroxin (TTFPB) as the additive could preferentially enter into the first shell structure of PF6&#8722; solvation and be decomposed on LiCoO2 surface at low oxidation potential to generate a LiBxOy&#8208;rich/LiF&#8208;rich CEI. The LiBxOy surface layer effectively maintained the integrity of CEI and provided excellent mechanical and thermal stability while abundant LiF in CEI further improved the thermal stability and homogeneity of CEI. Such CEI drastically alleviated the crack and regeneration of CEI and irreversible phase transformation of the cathode. As expected, the Li||LiCoO2 batteries with the tailored CEI achieved 91.9&#8201;% and 74.0&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 and 150&#8197;cycles at 4.6 and 4.7&#8197;V, respectively. Moreover, such batteries also delivered an unprecedented high&#8208;temperature performance with 73.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 4.6&#8197;V.

         <title>Grain Boundary Tailors the Local Chemical Environment on Iridium Surface for Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain Boundary induced the formation of a local acid&#8208;like environment with H3O+ intermediates on the iridium surface, which lowered the energy barrier for water dissociation and promoted the generation of hydrogen spillover to synergistically enhance the hydrogen evolution activity.







Abstract
Even though grain boundaries (GBs) have been previously employed to increase the number of active catalytic sites or tune the binding energies of reaction intermediates for promoting electrocatalytic reactions, the effect of GBs on the tailoring of the local chemical environment on the catalyst surface has not been clarified thus far. In this study, a GBs&#8208;enriched iridium (GB&#8722;Ir) was synthesized and examined for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Operando Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a local acid&#8208;like environment with H3O+ intermediates was created in the GBs region owing to the electron&#8208;enriched surface Ir atoms at the GBs. The H3O+ intermediates lowered the energy barrier for water dissociation and provided enough hydrogen proton to promote the generation of hydrogen spillover from the sites at the GBs to the sites away from the GBs, thus synergistically enhancing the hydrogen evolution activity. Notably, the GB&#8722;Ir catalyst exhibited a high alkaline HER activity (10&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). We believe that our findings will promote further research on GBs and the surface science of electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Lithium Chloride Oxidation by Covalent Organic Frameworks for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries</title>

An amine&#8208;functionalized COF with catalytic activity significantly decreases oxidation barrier and accelerates oxidation kinetics of LiCl in rechargeable Li&#8722;Cl2 battery. The resulting Li&#8722;Cl2 cell using COF&#8722;NH2 exhibits low overpotential and ultrahigh discharge capacity up to 3500&#8197;mAh/g, which can be stably cycled at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Rechargeable Li&#8722;Cl2 battery is a promising high energy density battery system. However, reasonable cycle life could only be achieved under low specific capacities due to the sluggish oxidation of LiCl to Cl2. Herein, we propose an amine&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) with catalytic activity, namely COF&#8722;NH2, that significantly decreases the oxidation barrier of LiCl and accelerates the oxidation kinetics of LiCl in Li&#8722;Cl2 cell. The resulting Li&#8722;Cl2 cell using COF&#8722;NH2 (Li&#8722;Cl2@COF&#8722;NH2) simultaneously exhibits low overpotential, ultrahigh discharge capacity up to 3500&#8197;mAh/g and a promoted utilization ratio of deposited LiCl at the first cycle (UR&#8722;LiCl) of 81.4&#8201;%, which is one of the highest reported values to date. Furthermore, the Li&#8722;Cl2@COF&#8722;NH2 cell could be stably cycled for over 200&#8197;cycles when operating at a capacity of 2000&#8197;mAh/g at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of &#8776;100&#8201;% and a discharge plateau of 3.5&#8197;V. Our superior Li&#8722;Cl2 batteries enabled by organocatalyst enlighten an arena towards high&#8208;energy storage applications.

         <title>Dithiophosphoric Acids for Polymer Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reporton a new polymer functionalization method for challenging poly&#8208;enes substates through a regioselective electrophilic Markovnikov addition with dithiophosphoric acids, which are derived from elemental sulfur and phosphorus feedstocks. DTPA functionalization to these poly&#8208;enes confer enhanced thermomechanical, optical and flame retardant properties using inexpensive reagents.







Abstract
Dithiophosphoric acids (DTPAs) are an intriguing class of compounds that are sourced from elemental sulfur and white phosphorus and are prepared from the reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with alcohols. The electrophilic addition of DTPAs to alkenes and unsaturated olefinic substrates is a known reaction, but has not been applied to polymer synthesis and polymer functionalization. We report on the synthesis and application of DTPAs for the functionalization of challenging poly&#8208;enes, namely polyisoprene (PI) and polynorbornene (pNB) prepared by ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The high heteroatom content within DTPA moieties impart intriguing bulk properties to poly&#8208;ene materials after direct electrophilic addition reactions to the polymer backbone introducing DTPAs as side chain groups. The resulting materials possess both enhanced optical and flame retardant properties vs the poly&#8208;ene starting materials. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to prepare crosslinked polydiene films with di&#8208;functional DTPAs, where the crosslinking density and thermomechanical properties can be directly tuned by DTPA feed ratios.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Nitroalkanes with (Hetero)aryl Bromides/Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of nitroalkanes with (hetero)aryl/alkenyl halides (Br, I) is described here. The method relies on using some newly developed oxalamide ligands, and gives coupling products in great diversity. Since the coupling products can be conveniently transformed into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl amines, ketones, carboxylic acids and aldehydes, our method provides a highly competitive approach for preparing these compounds from readily available (hetero)aryl halides.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aryl substituted nitroalkanes are valuable synthetic building blocks that can be easily converted into &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, as well as amines. Herein, an efficient Cu/oxalamide&#8208;catalyzed coupling between nitroalkanes and (hetero)aryl halides (Br, I) was developed to direct access highly diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted nitroalkanes. Compared with the current state of art, this protocol is more environmentally friendly and practical for synthetic chemists. This approach is characterized by a broad substrate scope on both nitroalkane part (primary nitroalkanes and nitromethane) and sp2 halide part ((hetero)aryl bromides/iodides and alkenyl bromides/iodides). The excellent functional group tolerance was observed, which would enable real world synthetic applications. More importantly, TON of current transformation reached to 3640, when some aryl iodides were used as coupling partners. This represents currently the highest catalyst turnover for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation of nitroalkanes. Furthermore, the successful application in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and synthesis of a known retinoid X receptor (RXR) antagonist exemplified its synthetic potential.

         <title>Uniformly Distributed Mixed Matrix Membranes via a Solution Processable Strategy for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocomposite named as ZIF&#8208;67@Ag4tz4 was introduced into 6FDA&#8208;TMPDA to give advanced mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for propylene/propane separation. The dual&#8208;facilitated mechanism (facilitate transport and molecular sieving) of the nanocomposite results in a significantly improved propylene/propane selectivity, which was clarified with the help of computational studies.







Abstract
Aggregation of filler particles during the formation of mixed matrix membranes is difficult to avoid when filler loadings exceed a 10&#8211;15&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Such agglomeration usually leads to poor membrane performance. In this work, using a ZIF&#8208;67 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as filler along with surface modification of Ag4tz4 to improve processability and selective olefin adsorption, we demonstrate that highly loaded with a very low agglomeration degree membranes can be synthesized displaying unmatched separation selectivity (39) for C3H6/C3H8 mixtures and high permeability rates (99&#8197;Barrer), far surpassing previous reports in the literature. Through molecular dynamics simulation, the enhanced compatibility between ZIF&#8208;67 and polymer matrix with adding Ag4tz4 was proven and the tendency in gas permeability and C3H6 selectivity in the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were well explained. More importantly, the membrane showed a wide range of pressure and temperature resistance, together with remarkable long&#8208;term stability (&gt;900&#8197;h). The modification method might help solve interface issues in MMMs and can be extended to the fabrication of other fillers to achieve high performance MMMs for gas separation.

         <title>Electrohydrogenation of Nitriles with Amines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a mild and efficient electrocatalytic method for earth&#8208;abundant cobalt hydride generation through a sequence of cathodic reduction and protonation. The application of this molecular cobalt catalyst allows for electroreductive amination of nitriles to produce various secondary and tertiary amines, as well as deuterium isotope labeling applications from readily available deuterium source.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles represents an efficient and sustainable one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable bulk and fine chemicals. We report herein a molecular cobalt electrocatalyst for selective hydrogenative coupling of nitriles with amines using protons as the hydrogen source. The key to success for this reductive reaction is the use of an electrocatalytic approach for efficient cobalt&#8208;hydride generation through a sequence of cathodic reduction and protonation. As only electrons (e&#8722;) and protons (H+) as the redox equivalent and hydrogen source, this general electrohydrogenation protocol is showcased by highly selective and straightforward synthesis of various functionalized and structurally diverse amines, as well as deuterium isotope labeling applications. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electrogenerated cobalt&#8208;hydride transfer to nitrile process is the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Highly Selective Lithium Transport through Crown Ether Pillared Angstrom Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired device that can sieve Li+ out of concentrated Na+ with high selectivity is constructed. The device is composed of angstrom channels that can enrich small cations and pillaring macrocycles that have specific interaction with alkaline ions. In solutions with the concentrations of Li+ and Na+ equal to those in seawater, the effective Li+ selectivity reaches 1422.







Abstract
Biological ion channels use the synergistic effects of various strategies to realize highly selective ion sieving. For example, potassium channels use functional groups and angstrom&#8208;sized pores to discriminate rival ions and enrich target ions. Inspired by this, we constructed a layered crystal pillared by crown ether that incorporates these strategies to realize high Li+ selectivity. The pillared channels and crown ether have an angstrom&#8208;scale size. The crown ether specifically allows the low&#8208;barrier transport of Li+. The channels attract and enrich Li+ ions by up to orders of magnitude. As a result, our material sieves Li+ out of various common ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Al3+. Moreover, by spontaneously enriching Li+ ions, it realizes an effective Li+/Na+ selectivity of 1422 in artificial seawater where the Li+ concentration is merely 25&#8197;&#956;M. We expect this work to spark technologies for the extraction of lithium and other dilute metal ions.

         <title>Structural Control of Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Carbene Zinc(II) Dithiolates
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc &#8208; the new iridium. Structural control of the dihedral angle between the ligands in trigonal&#8208;planar carbene&#8208;ZnII&#8208;dithiolates leads to highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with unprecedented radiative rate constants kTADF=1.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 297&#8197;K, which surpass the efficiency of commercial IrIII&#8208; and PtII&#8208;based triplet emitters.







Abstract
Luminescent metal complexes based on earth abundant elements are a valuable target to substitute 4d/5d transition metal complexes as triplet emitters in advanced photonic applications. Whereas CuI complexes have been thoroughly investigated in the last two decades for this purpose, no structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships for efficient luminescence involving triplet excited states from ZnII complexes are established. Herein, we report on the design of monomeric carbene zinc(II) dithiolates (CZT) featuring a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;motif that leads to highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with for ZnII compounds unprecedented radiative rate constants kTADF=1.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 297&#8197;K. Our high&#8208;level DFT/MRCI calculations revealed that the relative orientation of the ligands involved in the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1/3LLCT) states is paramount to control the TADF process. Specifically, a dihedral angle of 36&#8211;40&#176; leads to very efficient reverse intersystem&#8208;crossing (rISC) on the order of 109&#8197;s&#8722;1 due to spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) mediated by the sulfur atoms in combination with a small &#916;ES1&#8208;T1 of ca. 56&#8197;meV.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Cleavable Aromatic Polymers for the Fabrication of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Plastics with High Mechanical Strength and Excellent Chemical Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversibly cross&#8208;linked plastics with high strength and excellent chemical resistance are fabricated by copolymerizing aromatic amines and aldehydes with dynamic imine bonds. After depolymerization in acidic solutions, the corresponding monomers can be efficiently separated through their solubility difference in selective solvents or monomer conversion strategy to realize closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Although closed&#8208;loop recycling of dynamic covalent bond&#8208;based plastics does not require catalysts, their mechanical strength and chemical stability remain a major concern. In this study, closed&#8208;loop recyclable poly(aryl imine) (PAI) plastics with high mechanical strength and excellent chemical resistance are fabricated by copolymerizing aromatic amines and aromatic aldehydes through dynamic imine bonds. The resulting PAI plastic with a tensile strength of 58.2&#8197;MPa exhibits excellent chemical resistance and mechanical stability in acidic and basic aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. The PAI plastics can be depolymerized in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/HCl aqueous solution through the dissociation of imine bonds, and the monomers can be facilely recovered with high purity and isolated yields due to the solubility difference between the aromatic amines and aromatic aldehydes in selective solvents. The efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling of the PAI plastic can also be realized through monomer conversion because the hydrolysis of the aromatic aldehydes generates aromatic amines. The recovered monomers can be used to re&#8208;fabricate original PAI plastics. This PAI plastic can be selectively recovered from complicated mixed polymer waste streams due to the mild depolymerization conditions of the PAI plastic and its high stability in most organic solvents.

         <title>Topological Single&#8208;stranded DNA Encoding and Programmable Assembly of Molecular Nanostructures for NIR&#8208;II Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial base&#8208;directed topological DNA&#8208;encoding strategy is reported as a versatile platform for engineering NIR&#8208;II nanomedicine with programmable assembly and precise control over composition and surface valence. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies were performed to engineer Ag2S&#8208;DNA QDs and CuS&#8208;DNA nanodots, demonstrating strong emission or absorption in the NIR&#8208;II window favorable for applications in bioimaging and deep&#8208;penetration tumor therapy.







Abstract
Molecular nanotechnology promises to offer privileged access to developing NIR&#8208;II materials with precise structural and functional manipulation for transformable theranostic applications. However, the lack of an affordable, yet general, method makes this goal currently inaccessible. By virtue of the intriguing nucleic acid chemistry, here we present an artificial base&#8208;directed topological single&#8208;strand DNA encoding design that enables one&#8208;step synthesis of valence&#8208;controlled NIR&#8208;II molecular nanostructures and spatial assembly of these nanostructures to modulate their behaviors in living systems. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, we construct ultrasmall Ag2S quantum dots and pH&#8208;responsive, size&#8208;tunable CuS assemblies for in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and deep tumor photothermal therapy. This work paves a new way for creating functionally diversified architectures and broadens the scope of DNA&#8208;encoded material engineering.

By virtue of the intriguing nucleic acid chemistry, here we present an artificial base-directed topological single-strand DNA encoding design that enables one-step synthesis of valence-controlled NIR-II molecular nanostructures and spatial assembly of these nanostructures to modulate their behaviors in living systems. As proof-of-concept studies, we construct ultrasmall Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S quantum dots and pH-responsive, size-tunable CuS assemblies for in vivo NIR-II fluorescence imaging and deep tumor photothermal therapy. This work paves a new way for creating functionally diversified architectures and broadens the scope of DNA-encoded material engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting &#960; and Chalcogen Interactions for the &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Indoles through Glycal Conformational Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing productive chalcogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, a phosphonoselenide catalyst was used for stereoselective C,N&#8208;glycosylation. This unique activation manifold distorts the glycal conformation and enables both the C3 and N1 positions of indole to be appended directly to the anomeric position of glycals, thus providing access to an array of biologically important &#946;&#8208;indolyl glycosides.







Abstract
Harnessing unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) is emerging as a formidable synthetic approach in difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access glycosidic chemical space. C&#8208;Glycosylation, in particular, has gained a flurry of recent attention. However, most reported methods are restricted to the relatively facile access to &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides. Herein, we disclose a &#946;&#8208;stereoselective glycosylation of indoles by employing a phosphonoselenide catalyst. The robustness of this protocol is exemplified by its amenability for reaction at both the indolyl C&#8208; and N&#8208; reactivity sites. In contrast to previous reports, in which the chalcogens were solely involved in Lewis acidic activation, our mechanistic investigation unraveled that the often neglected flanking aromatic substituents of phosphonoselenides can substantially contribute to catalysis by engaging in &#960;&#8208;interactions. Computations and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the chalcogenic and aromatic components of the catalyst can be collectively exploited to foster conformational distortion of the glycal away from the usual half&#8208;chair to the boat conformation, which liberates the convex &#946;&#8208;face for nucleophilic attack.

         <title>Correlating Structural Disorder in Metal (Oxy)hydroxides and Catalytic Activity in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the structural disorder&#8208;activity correlation during the structural evolution process in oxygen electrocatalysis is crucial. This study highlights that the reaction&#8208;derived Fe&#8722;Ni bimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, featuring a more disordered structure by harnessing the bond mismatch between sulphide/selenide pre&#8208;catalysts and in situ&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxides, demonstrates enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Understanding the correlation between the structural evolution of electrocatalysts and their catalytic activity is both essential and challenging. In this study, we investigate this correlation in the context of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by examining the influence of structural disorder during and after dynamic structural evolution on the OER activity of Fe&#8722;Ni (oxy)hydroxide catalysts using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, alongside other experiments and theoretical calculations. The Debye&#8211;Waller factors obtained from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reflect the degree of structural disorder and exhibit a robust correlation with the intrinsic OER activities of the electrocatalysts. The enhanced OER activity of in situ&#8208;generated metal (oxy)hydroxides derived from different pre&#8208;catalysts is linked to increased structural disorder, offering a promising approach for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts. This strategy may inspire similar investigations in related electrocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Terminal Alkenyl Aza&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective hydrophosphination of alkenes is a promising route to chiral phosphorus compounds, but the use of alkenyl&#8208;heteroarenes is challenged by their low reactivity and control of stereoselectivity. Here we present a general Mn(I)&#8208;catalysed enantioselective hydrophosphination of alkenyl aza&#8208;heteroarenes. The method was applied to a wide range of alkenyl heterocycles and provided access to a non&#8208;symmetric P,N,P ligand structure.







Abstract
This paper presents a Mn(I)&#8208;catalysed methodology for the enantioselective hydrophosphination of terminal alkenyl aza&#8208;heteroarenes. The catalyst operates through H&#8722;P bond activation, enabling successful hydrophosphination of a diverse range of alkenyl&#8208;heteroarenes with high enantioselectivity. The presented protocol addresses the inherently low reactivity and the commonly encountered suboptimal enantioselectivities of these challenging substrates. As an important application we show that this method facilitates the synthesis of a non&#8208;symmetric tridentate P,N,P&#8208;containing ligand like structure in just two synthetic steps using a single catalytic system.

         <title>Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel Hybrid Aromatic Metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes Constructed by a Formal [10+1] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity, were constructed by a one pot [10+1] strategy. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their special aromaticity was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. This work provides a method to construct large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes, which is significant for metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry.







Abstract
Aromatic metalla&#8208;annulenes are important aromatic compounds, research into which has been mainly concentrated on metal&#8208;benzenes and their lower homologues. Reports on their superior homologs are rare, and this has greatly limited the systematic study of their properties. In this work, a series of osma&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with good air and thermal stability were prepared in high yields through a simple [10+1] strategy, by incorporating a metal fragment into conjugated ten&#8208;carbon chains in a one&#8208;pot reaction. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity is supported by various physical and computational parameters. Besides, these complexes show versatile reactivities, not only giving further evidence for their aromaticity, but also demonstrating their physical and chemical properties can easily be regulated. This work enriches the metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry, and provides a new avenue for the synthesis of large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes.

         <title>Volatile Perovskite Precursor Ink Enables Window Printing of Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules in Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a stable volatile precursor ink has been developed, enabling the wide speed window (0.3&#8197;m/min to 18.0&#8197;m/min) printing of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite film in an ambient atmosphere. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#8197;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32&#8201;% and 21.90&#8201;%, along with superior operational stability with T90&gt;1350&#8197;h.







Abstract
Despite the great success of perovskite photovoltaics in terms of device efficiency and stability using laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating methods, the demand for high&#8208;throughput and cost&#8208;effective solutions remains unresolved and rarely reported because of the complicated nature of perovskite crystallization. In this work, we propose a stable precursor ink design strategy to control the solvent volatilization and perovskite crystallization to enable the wide speed window printing (0.3 to 18.0&#8197;m/min) of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) in ambient atmosphere. The FAPbI3 perovskite precursor ink uses volatile acetonitrile (ACN) as the main solvent with DMF and DMSO as coordination additives is beneficial to improve the ink stability, inhibit the coffee rings, and the complicated intermediate FAPbI3 phases, delivering high&#8208;quality pin&#8208;hole free and phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite films with large&#8208;scale uniformity. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#8197;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32&#8201;% and 21.90&#8201;%, respectively, whereas the PCE of the devices can be maintained at 23.76&#8201;% when the printing speed increases to 18.0&#8197;m/min. Specifically, the unencapsulated device exhibits superior operational stability with T90&gt;1350&#8197;h. This work represents a step towards the scalable, cost&#8208;effective manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaics with both high performance and high throughput.

         <title>Cross&#8208;domain Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility of mid&#8208;block and chiral block is critical to the cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer in ABC*&#8208;type chiral triblock terpolymers. When the mid&#8208;block is compatible with the chiral block, chirality could transfer through the mid&#8208;domains with limited thickness. In contrast, as the mid&#8208;block is incompatible with the chiral block, chiral interactions will be restricted, independent with the length of mid&#8208;block.







Abstract
Chirality transfer is essential to acquire helical hierarchical superstructures from the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular materials. By taking advantage of chirality transfers at different length scales through intra&#8208;chain and inter&#8208;chain chiral interactions, helical phase (H*) can be formed from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral block copolymers (BCPs*). In this study, chiral triblock terpolymers, polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA), and polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;P4VP&#8208;PLLA) are synthesized for self&#8208;assembly. For PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA with an achiral PEO mid&#8208;block that is compatible with PLLA (chiral end&#8208;block), H* can be formed while the block length is below a critical value. By contrast, for the one with achiral P4VP mid&#8208;block that is incompatible with PLLA, the formation of H* phase would be suppressed regardless of the length of the mid&#8208;block, giving cylinder phase. Those results elucidate a new type of chirality transfer across the phase domain that is referred as cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer, providing complementary understanding of the chirality transfer at the interface of phase&#8208;separated domains.

         <title>Active Diluent&#8208;Anion Synergy Strategy Regulating Nonflammable Electrolytes for High&#8208;Efficiency Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonflammable dimethylacetamide (DMAC)&#8208;based localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE&#8208;DFB) was regulated by functional diluent 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (DFB) via active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy. DFB can cooperate with FSI&#8722; anion to construct robust LiF&#8208;rich SEI and CEI owing to its good fluorine&#8208;donating activity and low LUMO, effectively enhancing the interfacial stability of the Li metal anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy Li metal batteries (LMBs) consisting of Li metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes are promising candidates of the next generation energy&#8208;storage systems owing to their ultrahigh energy density. However, it is still challenging to develop high&#8208;voltage nonflammable electrolytes with superior anode and cathode compatibility for LMBs. Here, we propose an active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy to achieve outstanding compatibility with Li metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes by using 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (DFB) with high activity for yielding LiF as an active diluent to regulate nonflammable dimethylacetamide (DMAC)&#8208;based localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE&#8208;DFB). DFB and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anion cooperate to construct robust LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which effectively stabilize DMAC from intrinsic reactions with Li metal anode and enhance the interfacial stability of the Li metal anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes. LHCE&#8208;DFB enables ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (98.7&#8201;%), dendrite&#8208;free, extremely stable and long&#8208;term cycling of Li metal anodes in Li&#8201;||&#8201;Cu cells and Li&#8201;||&#8201;Li cells. The fabricated NCM811&#8201;||&#8201;Li cells with LHCE&#8208;DFB display remarkably enhanced long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy for designing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for high&#8208;energy batteries.

The local acidic microenvironment of a single&#8208;atom Ru catalyst is modulated by switching the crystallinity of the support, thus breaking the pH&#8208;dependent alkaline HER activity.







Abstract
Modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is critical to optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we innovatively propose a strategy to improve the local reaction environment of Ru single atoms by precisely switching the crystallinity of the support from high crystalline and low crystalline, which significantly improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst anchored on low&#8208;crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru&#8722;LC&#8722;Ni(OH)2) reconstructs the distribution balance of the interfacial ions due to the activation effect of metal dangling bonds on the support. Single&#8208;site Ru with a low oxidation state induces the aggregation of hydronium ions (H3O+), leading to the formation of a local acidic microenvironment in alkaline media, breaking the pH&#8208;dependent HER activity. As a comparison, the Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst anchored on high&#8208;crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru&#8722;HC&#8722;Ni(OH)2) exhibits a sluggish Volmer step and a conventional local reaction environment. As expected, Ru&#8722;LC&#8722;Ni(OH)2 requires low overpotentials of 9 and 136&#8197;mV at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline conditions and operates stably at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;h in an alkaline seawater anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer. This study provides a new perspective for constructing highly active single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Complete Biochemical Characterization of Pantaphos Biosynthesis Highlights an Unusual Role for a SAM&#8208;Dependent Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesis of the phosphonate natural product pantaphos involves a SAM&#8208;dependent methylation reaction, despite the fact that no SAM&#8208;derived carbon atoms are present in the final product. This irreversible reaction provides the driving force needed to overcome the unfavorable thermodynamics of the preceding dehydration, while reducing the toxicity of the biosynthetic intermediates.







Abstract
Pantaphos is small molecule virulence factor made by the plant pathogen Pantoea ananatis. An 11 gene operon, designated hvr for high virulence, is required for production of this phosphonic acid natural product, but the metabolic steps used in its production have yet to be established. Herein, we determine the complete biosynthetic pathway using a combination of bioinformatics, in vitro biochemistry and in vivo heterologous expression. Only 6 of the 11&#8197;hvr genes are needed to produce pantaphos, while a seventh is likely to be required for export. Surprisingly, the pathway involves a series of O&#8208;methylated intermediates, which are then hydrolyzed to produce the final product. The methylated intermediates are produced by an irreversible S&#8208;adenosylmethione (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferase that is required to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable dehydration in the preceding step, a function not previously attributed to members of this enzyme class. Methylation of pantaphos by the same enzyme is also likely to limit its toxicity in the producing organism. The pathway also involves a novel flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that differs from homologous proteins due to its endogenous flavin&#8208;reductase activity. Heterologous production of pantaphos by Escherichia coli strains expressing the minimal gene set strongly supports the in vitro biochemical data.

         <title>Carboxylated Hexagonal Boron Nitride/Graphene Configuration for Electrosynthesis of High&#8208;Concentration Neutral Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique carboxylated hexagonal boron nitride/graphene (h&#8208;BN/G) heterojunction was fabricated on the commercial activated carbon by combining B/N doping and surface modification. The catalyst reached the electrosynthesis of highly concentrated neutral H2O2 (2.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) under industrial current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) by promoting the O2 adsorption/activation and intermediate stabilization to reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen (O2) reduction reaction (ORR) has great potential to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, but the design of low&#8208;cost and highly active and selective catalysts is greatly challenging for the long&#8208;term H2O2 production under industrial relevant current density, especially under neutral electrolytes. To address this issue, this work constructed a carboxylated hexagonal boron nitride/graphene (h&#8208;BN/G) heterojunction on the commercial activated carbon through the coupling of B, N co&#8208;doping with surface oxygen groups functionalization. The champion catalyst exhibited a high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%), production rate (up to 13.4&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), and Faradaic efficiency (FE, &gt;95&#8201;%). The long&#8208;term H2O2 production under the high current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 caused the cumulative concentration as high as 2.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The combination of in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculation indicated that the carboxylated h&#8208;BN/G configuration promotes the adsorption of O2 and the stabilization of the key intermediates, allowing a low energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of HOOH* release from the active site and thus improving the 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The fast dye degradation by using this electrochemical synthesized H2O2 further illustrated the promising practical application.

         <title>Single Idiosyncratic Ionic Generator Working in Iso&#8208;Osmotic Solutions Via Ligand Confined Assembled in Gaps Between Nanosheets</title>

An artificial potassium ionic channel for mimicking biological iso&#8208;osmotic energy conversion system is achieved by the confined assembly of potassium ligand in the gaps between GO nanosheets.







Abstract
Numerous reported bioinspired osmotic energy conversion systems employing cation&#8208;/anion&#8208;selective membranes and solutions with different salinity are actually far from the biological counterpart. The iso&#8208;osmotic power generator with the specific ionic permselective channels (e.g., K+ or Na+ channels) which just allow specific ions to get across and iso&#8208;osmotic solutions still remain challenges. Inspired by nature, we report a bioinspired K+&#8208;channel by employing a K+ selective ligand, 1,1,1&#8208;tris{[(2&#8242;&#8208;benzylaminoformyl)phenoxy]methyl}ethane (BMP) and graphene oxide membrane. Specifically, the K+ and Na+ selectivity of the prepared system could reach up to &#8776;17.8, and the molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the excellent permselectivity of K+ mainly stemmed from the formed suitable channel size. Thus, we assembled the K+&#8208;selective iso&#8208;osmotic power generator (KSIPG) with the power density up to &#8776;15.1&#8197;mW/m2 between equal concentration solutions, which is higher than traditional charge&#8208;selective osmotic power generator (CSOPG). The proposed strategy has well shown the realizable approach to construct single&#8208;ion selective channels&#8208;based highly efficient iso&#8208;osmotic energy conversion systems and would surely inspire new applications in other fields, including self&#8208;powered systems and medical materials, etc.

         <title>Delving into the Variability of Supramolecular Affinity: Self&#8208;Ion Pairing as a Central Player in Aqueous Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
A 1&#8208;million&#8208;fold variability in the affinity of a multicharged host toward a guest ion highlights the pivotal role of self&#8208;ion pairing in host&#8211;guest chemistry in aqueous solution. These findings call for a critical reassessment of the existing data pertaining to multicharged receptors, emphasizing the need to specify concentration as a key element when reporting the complexation ability of these supramolecular hosts.







Abstract
The determination of binding constants is a key matter in evaluating the strength of host&#8211;guest interactions. However, the profound impact of self&#8208;ion pairing on this parameter is often underrated in aqueous solution, leading in some cases to a misinterpretation of the true potential of supramolecular assemblies. In the present study, we aim to shed further light on this critical factor by exploring the concentration&#8208;dependent behavior of a multicharged pillararene in water. Our observations reveal an extraordinary 1&#8208;million&#8208;fold variability in the affinity of this macrocycle toward a given anion, showcasing the highly dynamic character of electrostatic interactions. We argue that these findings bring to the forefront the inherent determinism that underlies the estimation of affinity constants, a factor profoundly shaped by both the sensitivity of the instrumental technique in use and the intricacies of the experimental design itself. In terms of applications, these results may provide the opportunity to optimize the operational concentrations of multicharged hosts in different scenarios, aiming to achieve their maximum efficiency based on the intended application. Unlocking the potential of this hidden variability may pave the way for the creation of novel molecular materials with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Polyurethane with &#946;&#8208;Selenocarbonyl Structure Enabling the Combination of Plastic Degradation and Waste Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>

The selenium&#8208;containing polyurethane materials are degraded into selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich plant cultivation and further improvement of selenium&#8208;deficiency within humans via selenoxide elimination reaction, achieving both the degradation and upcycling of plastic waste, offering a more sustainable plastic economy.







Abstract
Degradable polymers offer a promising solution to mitigate global plastic pollution, but the degraded products often suffer from diminished value. Upcycling is a more sustainable approach to upgrade polymer waste into value&#8208;added products. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208;selenocarbonyl&#8208;containing polyurethane (SePU), which can be directly degraded under mild conditions into valuable selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich vegetable cultivation globally, enabling both plastic degradation and waste upcycling. Under oxidation condition, this polymer can be easily and selectively degraded via selenoxide elimination reaction from mixed plastic waste. The degraded product can serve as effective selenium fertilizers to increase selenium content in radish and pak choi. The SePU exhibits excellent mechanical properties. Additionally, we observed the formation of spherulites&#8208;like selenium particles within the materials during degradation for the first time. Our research offers a successful application of selenoxide elimination reaction in the field of plastic degradation for the first time, endowing plastics with both degradability and high reusable value. This strategy provides a promising solution to reduce pollution and improve economy and sustainability of plastics.

         <title>DNAzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Specific N&#8208;Acylation of DNA Oligonucleotide Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery by in vitro selection of DNAzymes that catalyze cytidine, guanosine, and adenosine nucleobase N&#8208;acylation of DNA oligonucleotide substrates. The best new DNAzymes are rapid (complete reaction in hours), high&#8208;yielding (&gt;95&#8201;%), and site&#8208;specific for an individual nucleotide (&gt;95&#8201;% selective). Some of the new DNAzymes can also modify RNA substrates, which is promising for applications of DNAzymes to site&#8208;specific RNA labeling.







Abstract
We used in vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate the exocyclic nucleobase amines of cytidine, guanosine, and adenosine in DNA oligonucleotides. The acyl donor was the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl ester (TFPE) of a 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl oligonucleotide. Yields are as high as &gt;95&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h. Several of the N&#8208;acylation DNAzymes are catalytically active with RNA rather than DNA oligonucleotide substrates, and eight of nine DNAzymes for modifying C are site&#8208;specific (&gt;95&#8201;%) for one particular substrate nucleotide. These findings expand the catalytic ability of DNA to include site&#8208;specific N&#8208;acylation of oligonucleotide nucleobases. Future efforts will investigate the DNA and RNA substrate sequence generality of DNAzymes for oligonucleotide nucleobase N&#8208;acylation, toward a universal approach for site&#8208;specific oligonucleotide modification.

         <title>Dynamic in situ Formation of Cu2O Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters through Photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling's Reaction for Selective and Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic Cu2O nanoclusters are operando constructed by a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling&#8208;reaction, which work as the true active sites for sustainable nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is evidenced to be effective for constructing advanced catalysts. In particular, Cu2O is identified to be active for general catalytic reactions. However, conflicting results regarding the true structure&#8208;activity correlations between Cu2O&#8208;based active sites and efficiencies are usually reported. The structure of Cu2O undergoes dynamic evolution rather than remaining stable under working conditions, in which the actual reaction cannot proceed over the prefabricated Cu2O sites. Therefore, the dynamic construction of Cu2O active sites can be developed to promote catalytic efficiency and reveal the true structure&#8208;activity correlations. Herein, by introducing the redox pairs of Cu2+ and reducing sugar into a photocatalysis system, it is clarified that the Cu2O sub&#8208;nanoclusters (NCs), working as novel active sites, are on&#8208;site constructed on the substrate via a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling's route. The realistic interfacial charge separation and transformation capacities are remarkably promoted by the dynamic Cu2O NCs under the actual catalysis condition, which achieves a milestone efficiency for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis, including the targets of production rate (1.98&#177;0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;gCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), conversion ratio (94.2&#177;0.91&#8201;%), and selectivity (98.6&#8201;%&#177;0.55&#8201;%). The current work develops an effective strategy for integrating the active site construction into realistic reactions, providing new opportunities for Cu&#8208;based chemistry and catalysis sciences research.

         <title>Isonitriles as Alkyl Radical Precursors in Visible Light Mediated Hydro&#8208; and Deuterodeamination Reactions

         <dc:description>
We report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in visible&#8208;light mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. Most examples only require visible&#8208;light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor, although a significant acceleration was observed in the presence of an organic photocatalyst. The method is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and is general for C&#945;&#8208;primary, C&#945;&#8208;secondary and C&#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl isonitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in light&#8208;mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. The reaction is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and potential to be used in late&#8208;stage functionalization. Importantly, the method is general for C&#945;&#8208;primary, C&#945;&#8208;secondary and C&#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl isonitriles. For most examples, high yields were obtained through direct visible&#8208;light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor. Interestingly, in the presence of an organic photocatalyst (4CzIPN) a dramatic acceleration was observed. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies using UV/Vis absorption, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopy suggest that the excited state of 4CzIPN can engage in a single&#8208;electron transfer with the isonitrile.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethoxylation of Silyl Enol Ethers and Allyl Silanes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free trifluoromethoxylation methods of alkenyl substrates under mild conditions have been developed using bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and relatively atom&#8208;economical reagent. Silyl enol ether substrates react to form either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketones or OCF3&#8208;containing silyl enol ethers depending on the solvent used while allyl silanes afford unprecedented allyl(trifluoromethyl)ethers.







Abstract
Radical trifluoromethoxylation is an attractive approach to prepare compounds featuring the important OCF3 group, however most existing methods have focused on aromatic substrates. Here, we report novel methodologies with alkenyl substrates employing bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and comparatively atom economical trifluoromethoxylating reagent. With silyl enol ether substrates, switching reaction solvent allows for the synthesis of either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketone products or unprecedented alkenyl&#8208;OCF3 species. Furthermore, allyl silanes have been employed as substrates for the first time, affording allyl(trifluoromethyl)ether products in good yields. In each case, the methods operate at room temperature without large excesses of the alkene substrate while, in contrast to previous radical trifluoromethoxylation reactions, no catalyst, light or other activators are required.

&lt;p&gt;Catalyst-free trifluoromethoxylation methods of alkenyl substrates under mild conditions have been developed using bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and relatively atom-economical reagent. Silyl enol ether substrates react to form either &#945;-(trifluoromethoxy)ketones or OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing silyl enol ethers depending on the solvent used while allyl silanes afford unprecedented allyl(trifluoromethyl)ethers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical trifluoromethoxylation is an attractive approach to prepare compounds featuring the important OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, however most existing methods have focused on aromatic substrates. Here, we report novel methodologies with alkenyl substrates employing bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and comparatively atom economical trifluoromethoxylating reagent. With silyl enol ether substrates, switching reaction solvent allows for the synthesis of either &#945;-(trifluoromethoxy)ketone products or unprecedented alkenyl-OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; species. Furthermore, allyl silanes have been employed as substrates for the first time, affording allyl(trifluoromethyl)ether products in good yields. In each case, the methods operate at room temperature without large excesses of the alkene substrate while, in contrast to previous radical trifluoromethoxylation reactions, no catalyst, light or other activators are required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Photosensitizer with High Enrichment in Tumor Cells Based on a Multi&#8208;Effect Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>

We report a multi&#8208;effect &#8220;1&#8208;to&#8208;3&#8221; strategy&#8212;one enzymatic stimulus leads to three effects&#8212;with the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable, tumor cell&#8208;targeting fluorogenic probe and photosensitizer (PS). This PS is selectively activated by alkaline phosphatase, which is overexpressed in tumor cells and causes enrichment of the PS in these cells upon a change in hydrophobicity, resulting in turn&#8208;on near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photosensitizing ability.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes and photosensitizers (PSs) have emerged as promising tools for molecular imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, in living organisms selective retention or even enrichment of these reagents after enzymatic activation at or near sites of interest remains a challenging task. Herein, we integrate non&#8208;covalent and covalent retention approaches to introduce a novel &#8220;1&#8208;to&#8208;3&#8221; multi&#8208;effect strategy&#8212;one enzymatic stimulus leads to three types of effects&#8212;for the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable NIR probe or PS. Using this strategy, we have constructed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;activatable NIR fluorogenic probe and a NIR PS, which proved to be selectively activated by ALP to switch on NIR fluorescence or photosensitizing ability, respectively. Additionally, these reagents showed significant enrichment (over 2000&#8208;fold) in ALP&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells compared to the culture medium, accompanied by massive depletion of intracellular thiols, the major antioxidants in cells. The investigation of this ALP&#8208;activatable NIR PS in an in vivo PDT model resulted in complete suppression of HeLa tumors and full recovery of all tested mice. Encouragingly, even a single administration of this NIR PS was sufficient to completely suppress tumors in mice, demonstrating the high potential of this strategy in biomedical applications.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Hydroarylation(Alkenylation) of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access (&#8722;CF2H) Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically bulky NHC&#8208;nickel catalyst promoted site&#8208;selective hydroarylation(alkenylation) of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes by coupling with organotriflates(bromides) and sodium 1&#8208;phenylethoxide as hydride source to furnish products containing CF2H&#8208;substituted carbon centers. Experimental and computational studies shed light on the non&#8208;radical mechanism and the metal alkoxide's role in facilitating the reaction.







Abstract
An emerging class of C&#8722;C coupling transformations that furnish drug&#8208;like building blocks involves catalytic hydrocarbonation of alkenes. However, despite notable advances in the field, hydrocarbon addition to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes without additional electronic activation remains largely unsuccessful. This owes partly to poor reactivity and the propensity of difluoroalkenes to undergo defluorinative side reactions. Here, we report a nickel catalytic system that promotes efficient 1,2&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation, suppressing defluorination and providing straightforward access to a diverse assortment of prized organofluorides bearing difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted carbon centers. In contrast to radical&#8208;based pathways and reactions triggered by hydrometallation via a nickel&#8208;hydride complex, our experimental and computational studies support a mechanism in which a catalytically active nickel&#8208;bromide species promotes selective carbonickelation with difluoroalkenes followed by alkoxide exchange and hydride transfer, effectively overcoming the difluoroalkene's intrinsic electronic bias.

         <title>Accelerated Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Water Oxidation under Spatial Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial synergy has been identified as a novel approach to enhance photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation on defect complexes for the first time. This strategy synchronizes the breakage of O&#8722;H bonds in water oxidation and the formation of *COOH in CO2 reduction, effectively promoting both processes.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into fuels and oxygen is a highly promising solution for carbon&#8208;neutral recycling. Traditionally, researchers have studied CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation separately, overlooking potential synergistic interplay between these processes. This study introduces an innovative approach, spatial synergy, which encourages synergistic progress by bringing the two half&#8208;reactions into atomic proximity. To facilitate this, we developed a defective ZnIn2S4&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst (Cu&#8722;SA/D&#8722;ZIS), which demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance with CO2 reduction rates of 112.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and water oxidation rates of 52.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, exhibiting a six&#8208;fold enhancement over D&#8722;ZIS. The structural characterization results indicated that the trapping effect of vacancy associates on single&#8208;atom copper led to the formation of an unsaturated coordination structure, Cu&#8208;S3, consequently giving rise to the CuZn&#8242;VS&#8901;&#8901;VZn&#8220; defect complexes. FT&#8208;IR studies coupled with theoretical calculations reveal the spatially synergistic CO2 reduction and water oxidation on CuZn&#8242;VS&#8901;&#8901;VZn&#8221;, where the breakage of O&#8722;H in water oxidation is synchronized with the formation of *COOH, significantly lowering the energy barrier. Notably, this study introduces and, for the first time, substantiates the spatial synergy effect in CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation through a combination of experimental and theoretical analyses, providing a fresh insight in optimizing photocatalytic system.

         <title>Low&#8208;Electronegativity Mn&#8208;Contraction of PtMn Nanodendrites Boosts Oxygen Reduction Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low&#8208;electronegativity Mn&#8208;contraction is reported herein for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy, which is the main reason for achieving superior stability of oxygen reduction and membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Platinum metal (PtM, M=Ni, Fe, Co) alloys catalysts show high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity due to their well&#8208;known strain and ligand effects. However, these PtM alloys usually suffer from a deficient ORR durability in acidic environment as the alloyed metal is prone to be dissolved due to its high electronegativity. Herein, we report a new class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low&#8208;electronegativity Mn&#8208;contraction for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. The moderate strain in PtMn, induced by Mn contraction, yields optimal oxygen reduction activity at 0.53&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Most importantly, we show that relative to well&#8208;known high&#8208;electronegativity Ni&#8208;based Pt alloy counterpart, the PtMn nanodendrite catalyst experiences less transition metals&#8217; dissolution in acidic solution and achieves an outstanding mass activity retention of 96&#8201;% after 10,000 degradation cycles. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy. The PtMn nanodendrite&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly delivers an outstanding peak power density of 1.36&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low Pt loading and high&#8208;performance retention over 50&#8197;h operations at 0.6&#8197;V in H2&#8208;O2 hydrogen fuel cells.

&lt;p&gt;A class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low-electronegativity Mn-contraction is reported herein for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy, which is the main reason for achieving superior stability of oxygen reduction and membrane electrode assembly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum metal (PtM, M=Ni, Fe, Co) alloys catalysts show high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity due to their well-known strain and ligand effects. However, these PtM alloys usually suffer from a deficient ORR durability in acidic environment as the alloyed metal is prone to be dissolved due to its high electronegativity. Herein, we report a new class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low-electronegativity Mn-contraction for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. The moderate strain in PtMn, induced by Mn contraction, yields optimal oxygen reduction activity at 0.53&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Most importantly, we show that relative to well-known high-electronegativity Ni-based Pt alloy counterpart, the PtMn nanodendrite catalyst experiences less transition metals&#8217; dissolution in acidic solution and achieves an outstanding mass activity retention of 96&#8201;% after 10,000 degradation cycles. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy. The PtMn nanodendrite-based membrane electrode assembly delivers an outstanding peak power density of 1.36&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low Pt loading and high-performance retention over 50&#8197;h operations at 0.6&#8197;V in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogen fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Element of Vitamin U&#8208;Mimicking Antibacterial Polypeptide with Ultrahigh Selectivity for Effectively Treating MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylated sulfonium polypeptides mimicking vitamin U motifs were prepared by NCA ring&#8208;open reaction. Obtained Gx&#8208;PM&#8208;n polypeptides with regulated alkylations and polymerization degrees exhibited an ultrahigh selectivity index of 16000 among the reported AMPs or peptoids and potent anti&#8208;MRSA performances both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit mighty antibacterial properties without inducing drug resistance. Achieving much higher selectivity of AMPs towards bacteria and normal cells has always been a continuous goal to be pursued. Herein, a series of sulfonium&#8208;based polypeptides with different degrees of branching and polymerization were synthesized by mimicking the structure of vitamin U. The polypeptide, G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+, shows both potent antibacterial activity and the highest selectivity index of 16000 among the reported AMPs or peptoids (e.g., the known index of 9600 for recorded peptoid in &#8220;Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 59, 6412.&#8221;), which can be attributed to the high positive charge density of sulfonium and the regulation of hydrophobic chains in the structure. The antibacterial mechanisms of G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ are primarily ascribed to the interaction with the membrane, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disfunction of ribosomes. Meanwhile, altering the degree of alkylation leads to selective antibacteria against either gram&#8208;positive or gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a mixed&#8208;bacteria model. Additionally, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ exhibited superior efficacy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to vancomycin. Together, these results show that G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ possesses high biocompatibility and is a potential pharmaceutical candidate in combating bacteria significantly threatening human health.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active Coinage&#8208;metal Sulfide Clusters for High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>

High X&#8208;ray absorption and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties jointly support hexanuclear cluster scintillators for high&#8208;resolution imaging.







Abstract
The study of facile&#8208;synthesis and low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray scintillators with high light yield, low detection limit and high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution plays a vital role in medical and industrial imaging fields. However, the optimal balance between X&#8208;ray absorption, decay lifetime and excitonic utilization efficiency of scintillators to achieve high&#8208;resolution imaging is extremely difficult due to the inherent contradiction. Here two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;actived coinage&#8208;metal clusters M6S6L6 (M=Ag or Cu) were synthesized by simple solvothermal reaction, where the cooperation of heavy atom&#8208;rich character and TADF mechanism supports strong X&#8208;ray absorption and rapid luminescent collection of excitons. Excitingly, Ag6S6L6 (SC&#8208;Ag) displays a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91.6&#8201;% and scintillating light yield of 17420&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1, as well as a low detection limit of 208.65&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 that is 26&#8197;times lower than the medical standard (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1). More importantly, a high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 16&#8197;lp/mm based on SC&#8208;Ag screen is demonstrated. Besides, rigid core skeleton reinforced by metallophilicity endows clusters M6S6L6 strong resistance to humidity and radiation. This work provides a new view for the design of efficient scintillators and opens the research door for silver clusters in scintillation application.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;dimensional Layered Composite Carbosilicates from in situ Unzipped Carbon Nanotubes and Exfoliated Bulk Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via unzipping and zipping processes, an ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional layered carbosilicate is obtained by hydrothermal treatment. In a one&#8208;pot reaction, CNT and bulk silica are unzipped by the reaction of iron and water, followed by iron zipping the unzipped species to form the carbosilicate. The unprecedent phenomenon brings us new insight on synergistic chemistry, stimulating the discovery of new structures and materials.







Abstract
A key task in today's inorganic synthetic chemistry is to develop effective reactions, routes, and associated techniques aiming to create new functional materials with specifically desired multilevel structures and properties. Herein, we report an ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional layered composite of graphene ribbon and silicate via a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot reaction, which leads to the creation of a novel carbon&#8208;metal&#8208;silicate hybrid family: carbosilicate. The graphene ribbon is in situ formed by unzipping carbon nanotubes, while the ultrathin silicate is in situ obtained from bulk silica or commercial glass; transition metals (Fe or Ni) oxidized by water act as bridging agent, covalently bonding the two structures. The unprecedented structure combines the superior properties of the silicate and the nanocarbon, which triggers some specific novel properties. All processes during synthesis are complementary to each other. The associated synergistic chemistry could stimulate the discovery of a large class of more interesting, functionalized structures and materials.

         <title>Electronically Manipulated Molecular Strategy Enabling Highly Efficient Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce trimethoxy (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)&#8208;silane (F3&#8208;TMOS) with molecular dipole moment pointing towards the hole transport layer as the buried interface modification material, which not only optimizes energy level alignment and carrier dynamics but also relieves interface strain and reduces lattice distortion, resulting in a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.67&#8201;%.







Abstract
Buried interface modification can effectively improve the compatibility between interfaces. Given the distinct interface selections in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the applicability of a singular modification material remains limited. Consequently, in response to this challenge, we devised a tailored molecular strategy based on the electronic effects of specific functional groups. Therefore, we prepared three distinct silane coupling agents, and due to the varying inductive effects of these functional groups, the electronic distribution and molecular dipole moments of the coupling agents are correspondingly altered. Among them, trimethoxy (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)&#8208;silane (F3&#8208;TMOS), which possesses electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, generates a molecular dipole moment directed toward the hole transport layer (HTL). This approach changes the work function of the HTL, optimizes the energy level alignment, reduces the open&#8208;circuit voltage loss, and facilitates carrier transport. Furthermore, through the buffering effect of the coupling agent, the interface strain and lattice distortion caused by annealing the perovskite are reduced, enhancing the stability of the tin&#8208;based perovskite. Encouragingly, tin PSCs treated with F3&#8208;TMOS achieved a champion efficiency of 14.67&#8201;%. This strategy provides an expedient avenue for the design of buried interface modification materials, enabling precise molecular adjustments in accordance with distinct interfacial contexts to ameliorate mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we introduce trimethoxy (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-silane (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TMOS) with molecular dipole moment pointing towards the hole transport layer as the buried interface modification material, which not only optimizes energy level alignment and carrier dynamics but also relieves interface strain and reduces lattice distortion, resulting in a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.67&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buried interface modification can effectively improve the compatibility between interfaces. Given the distinct interface selections in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the applicability of a singular modification material remains limited. Consequently, in response to this challenge, we devised a tailored molecular strategy based on the electronic effects of specific functional groups. Therefore, we prepared three distinct silane coupling agents, and due to the varying inductive effects of these functional groups, the electronic distribution and molecular dipole moments of the coupling agents are correspondingly altered. Among them, trimethoxy (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-silane (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TMOS), which possesses electron-withdrawing groups, generates a molecular dipole moment directed toward the hole transport layer (HTL). This approach changes the work function of the HTL, optimizes the energy level alignment, reduces the open-circuit voltage loss, and facilitates carrier transport. Furthermore, through the buffering effect of the coupling agent, the interface strain and lattice distortion caused by annealing the perovskite are reduced, enhancing the stability of the tin-based perovskite. Encouragingly, tin PSCs treated with F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TMOS achieved a champion efficiency of 14.67&#8201;%. This strategy provides an expedient avenue for the design of buried interface modification materials, enabling precise molecular adjustments in accordance with distinct interfacial contexts to ameliorate mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Engineering Mediated by Cation Conjugation in Luminescent Uranyl&#8208;Organic Hybrid Materials</title>

Herein, we have employed a simple series of crystalline materials of the form [HAr]2[UO2X4] (Ar=aromatic N&#8208;heterocycle, X=Cl or Br) as a platform to study the influence of the outer&#8208;sphere cation HAr+ on the photophysics of uranyl emission. Through a combination of experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide explanations for the distinct energy transfer pathways in each compound.







Abstract
A series of compounds of the form [HAr]2[UO2X4] is reported here, wherein Ar is systematically varied between pyridine (1&#8208;X), quinoline (2&#8208;X), acridine (3&#8208;X), 2,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazine (4&#8208;X), quinoxaline (5&#8208;X), and phenazine (6&#8208;X), and X=Cl or Br. With greater conjugation in the organic cation, a larger quenching in uranyl luminescence is observed in the solid state. Supporting our luminescence experiments with computation, we map out the potential energy diagrams for the singlet and triplet states of both the [HAr]+ cations and [UO2Cl4]2&#8722; anion in the crystalline state, and of the assembly. The distinct energy transfer pathways in each compound are discussed.

         <title>Modulating the Dipole Moment of Secondary Ammonium Spacers for Efficient 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>

Two dipole spacers based on azetidine (Az), namely 3&#8208;OHAz and 3,3&#8208;DFAz, were developed for 2D PSCs. The 3,3&#8208;DFAz&#8208;Pb (n=4) with highly polarized dipole and fluorinated spacers exhibits improved film quality, better&#8208;matched energy level alignment, and a lower exciton binding energy compared to 3&#8208;OHAz&#8208;Pb film. When using mixed A&#8208;site cations, the 3,3&#8208;DFAz&#8208;based device achieved a champion PCE of 19.85&#8201;%.







Abstract
Layered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are emerging as promising optoelectronic materials owing to their excellent environmental stability. Regulating the dipole moment of organic spacers has the potential to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) of 2D perovskites and improve their photovoltaic performance. Here, we developed two azetidine&#8208;based secondary ammonium spacers with different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, namely 3&#8208;hydroxyazatidine (3&#8208;OHAz) and 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine (3,3&#8208;DFAz) spacers, for 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. It was found that the large dipole moment of the fluorinated dipole spacer could effectively enhance the interaction between organic spacers and inorganic layers, leading to improved charge dissociation in 2D RP perovskite. In contrast to 3&#8208;OHAz spacer, the 2D perovskite using 3,3&#8208;DFAz as spacer also shows improved film quality, optimized energy level alignment, and reduced exciton binding energy. As a result, the 2D perovskite (n=4) device based on 3,3&#8208;DFAz yields an outstanding efficiency of 19.28&#8201;%, surpassing that of the 3&#8208;OHAz&#8208;Pb device (PCE=11.35&#8201;%). The efficiency was further improved to 19.85&#8201;% when using mixed A&#8208;site cation of MA0.95FA0.05. This work provides an effective strategy for modulating the energy level alignment and reducing the Eb by regulating the dipole moment of organic spacers, ultimately enabling the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Multiple&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters towards High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular design strategy has been developed to achieve both near&#8208;infrared emission and narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters. Record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of nearly 30&#8201;%, and exceptional operational stability (LT97&gt;39084&#8197;h) are realized simultaneously in the corresponding NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are highly coveted for their high efficiency and narrowband emission in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) MR&#8208;TADF emitters remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we design two new NIR MR&#8208;TADF emitters, PXZ&#8722;R&#8722;BN and BCz&#8722;R&#8722;BN, by embedding 10H&#8208;phenoxazine (PXZ) and 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (BCz) fragments to increase the electron&#8208;donating ability or extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation on the framework of para&#8208;boron fusing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Both compounds emit in the NIR region, with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 49&#8197;nm (0.13&#8197;eV) for PXZ&#8722;R&#8722;BN and 43&#8197;nm (0.11&#8197;eV) for BCz&#8722;R&#8722;BN in toluene. To sensitize the two NIR MR&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs, a new platinum complex, Pt&#8208;1, is designed as a sensitizer. The PXZ&#8722;R&#8722;BN&#8208;based sensitized OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of nearly 30&#8201;% with an emission band at 693&#8197;nm, and exceptional long operational stability with an LT97 (time to 97&#8201;% of the initial luminance) value of 39084&#8197;h at an initial radiance of 1000&#8197;mW&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. The BCz&#8722;R&#8722;BN&#8208;based OLEDs reach EQEmax values of 24.2&#8201;% with an emission band at 713&#8197;nm, which sets a record value for NIR OLEDs with emission bands beyond 700&#8197;nm.

An enzymatic decarboxylative aldol reaction was developed for the synthesis of noncanonical &#945;&#8208;amino acids containing &#947;&#8208;tertiary alcohol groups. The modularity of the electrophile enabled access to four classes of ncAAs with high efficiency as well as excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) containing tertiary alcohols are valuable as precursors of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the assembly of such ncAA scaffolds from simple material by C&#8722;C bond formation remains a challenging task due to the presence of multiple stereocenters and large steric hindrance. In this study, we present a novel solution to this problem through highly selective enzymatic decarboxylative aldol addition. This method allows for the streamlined assembly of multifunctionalized ncAAs with &#947;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available materials, such as L&#8208;aspartatic acid and isatins, vicinal diones and keto esters. The modularity of electrophiles furnished four classes of ncAAs with decent efficiency as well as excellent site and stereocontrol. Computational modeling was employed to gain detailed insight into the catalytic mechanism and to provide a rationale for the observed selectivities. The method offers a single&#8208;step approach to producing multifunctionalized ncAAs, which can be directly utilized in peptide synthesis and bioactivity assessment.

         <title>Coupling Electrochemical Sulfion Oxidation with CO2 Reduction over Highly Dispersed p&#8208;Bi Nanosheets and CO2&#8208;Assisted Sulfur Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfion electro&#8208;oxidation coupled CO2 reduction system for the co&#8208;productions of formate and sulfur was constructed to lower electricity consumption. Meantime, a novel, low cost and environmentally friendly CO2&#8208;assisted sulfur separation technique was developed, and the by&#8208;product NaHCO3 can be used as electrolyte for cathodic CO2RR or in other chemical industry technologies.







Abstract
We report herein an electrocatalytic CO2 reduction&#8208;coupled sulfion oxidation system for the co&#8208;productions of valuable formate and sulfur at much enhanced atom utilization. Specifically, an organic ligand&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step reconstruction approach has been developed to fabricate the highly dispersed p&#8208;Bi nanosheets (p&#8208;Bi NSs) for cathodic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and meanwhile porous Co&#8722;S nanosheets (Co&#8722;S NSs) was applied for anodic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR). Significantly high Faradaic Efficiencies of about 90&#8201;% for formate production by CO2RR in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and excellent SOR performances including an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of about 0.2&#8197;V and recycle capacity of S2&#8722; in the 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M S2&#8722; solutions, have been simultaneously achieved. In the meantime, both the structure transformation of the catalysts and the reaction pathways are explored and discussed in detail. A two&#8208;electrode CO2RR||SOR electrolyzer equipped with above electrocatalysts has been established, which features as low as about 1.5&#8197;V to run the electrolyzer at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, manifesting extremely lowered electricity consumption in comparison to conventional CO2RR system. Moreover, a sulfur separation approach has been proposed by using CO2, which is efficient, environmentally friendly and cost effective with value&#8208;added NaHCO3 be obtained as the byproduct.

         <title>Creating Remarkably Moisture&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Macromolecular Lewis Acid by Integrating Borane within the Polymer Chain: A Highly Active Catalyst for Homo(co)polymerization of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borane&#8208;based Lewis acids play an indispensable role in organocatalyst&#8208;mediated polymerization, but most of them are moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive. This work presents a remarkably moisture and air&#8208;stable macromolecular borane Lewis acid, employing an integration strategy to unify multiple borane within a polymer chain. It functions as a highly active catalyst for homo(co)polymerization of epoxides (TOF=27900&#8197;h&#8722;1) and shows large tolerance to chain transfer agent (1800&#8197;equiv. H2O).







Abstract
Borane&#8208;based Lewis acids (LA) play an indispensable role in the Lewis pair (LP) mediated polymerization. However, most borane&#8208;based LPs are moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive. Therefore, development of moisture and air&#8208;stable borane&#8208;based LP is highly desirable. To achieve this goal, the concept of &#8220;aggregation induced enlargement effects&#8221; by chemically linking multiple borane within a nanoscopic confinement was conceived to create macromolecular LA. Accordingly, an extremely moisture and air stable macromolecular borane, namely, PVP&#8208;1B featuring poly(4&#8208;vinylphenol) backbone, was constructed. The concentration of borane active site is greatly higher than average concentration due to local confinement. Therefore, an enhanced activity was observed. Moreover, the local LA aggregation effects allow its tolerance to air and large amount of chain transfer agent. Consequently, PVP&#8208;1B showed remarkable efficiency for propylene oxide (PO) polymerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C (TOF=27900&#8197;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, it enables generation of well&#8208;defined telechelic poly (CHO&#8208;alt&#8208;CO2) diol (0.6&#8211;15.3&#8197;kg/mol) with narrow &#272;s via copolymerizing cyclohexene oxide and CO2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This work indicates unifying multiple borane within a polymer in a macromolecular level shows superior catalytic performance than constructing binary, bi(multi)functional systems in a molecular level. This paves a new way to make functional polyethers.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Multiple Resonance Distribution Regions of a B,N&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon to Customize Its BT2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrapure green emitter was successfully prepared by precisely regulating multiple resonance (MR) distribution regions. The optimized top&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode simultaneously achieved a record&#8208;high current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8208;1, an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum of 16&#8197;nm, a nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79), and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Recently, boron (B)/nitrogen (N)&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by multiple resonances (MR), have attracted significant attention owing to their remarkable features of efficient narrowband emissions with small full width at half maxima (FWHMs). However, developing ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;green emitters that comply with the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT2020) standard remains challenging. Precise regulation of the MR distribution regions allows simultaneously achieving the emission maximum, FWHM value, and spectral shape that satisfy the BT2020 standard. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule TPABO&#8208;DICz exhibited ultrapure green emission with a dominant peak at 515&#8197;nm, an extremely small FWHM of 17&#8197;nm, and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.76). The corresponding bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a remarkably high CIEy value (0.74) and maximum external quantum efficiency (25.8&#8201;%). Notably, the top&#8208;emitting OLED achieved nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79) and exhibited a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art maximum current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8722;1, thus fully confirming the effectiveness of the above strategy.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Promoted Depolymerization of Oxidized Lignin via Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation/Reduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first semi&#8208;hydrogenation/reduction strategy for photocatalytic depolymerization of oxidized native lignin was realized by the synergistic effect between CsPbBr3 quantum dots and Hantzsch ester. Mechanism analysis reveals this approach generates a C&#945; radical intermediate with 4&#8197;times lower bond dissociation energy of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;Ar bond from the substrate's carbonyl group, resulting in the excellent reactivity in a wide substrate scope.







Abstract
Due to the demanding depolymerization conditions and limited catalytic efficiency, enhancing lignin valorization remains challenging. Therefore, lowering the bond dissociation energy (BDE) has emerged as a viable strategy for achieving mild yet highly effective cleavage of bonds. In this study, a photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation/reduction strategy utilizing CsPbBr3 quantum dots (CPB&#8208;QDs) and Hantzsch ester (HEH2) as a synergistic catalytic system was introduced to reduce the BDE of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;Ar, achieving effective cleavage of the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;Ar bond. This strategy offers a wide substrate scope encompassing various &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model lignin dimers, preoxidized &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymers, and native oxidized lignin, resulting in the production of corresponding ketones and phenols. Notably, this approach attained a turnover frequency (TOF) that is 17&#8197;times higher than that of the reported Ir&#8208;catalytic system in the photocatalytic depolymerization of the lignin model dimers. It has been observed via meticulous experimentation that HEH2 can be activated by CPB&#8208;QDs via single electron transfer (SET), generating HEH2&#8901;+ as a hydrogen donor while also serving as a hole quencher. Moreover, HEH2&#8901;+ readily forms an active transition state with the substrates via hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) from HEH2&#8901;+ to the carbonyl group of the substrate generates a C&#945;&#8901; intermediate.

         <title>Self&#8208;reporting and Biodegradable Thermosetting Solid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the significant effort to improve the performance of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes as well as the sustainability in SPEs is still lacking. Here, we report a self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting SPE via well&#8208;designed structure to analyze the performance mechanism behind SPEs and promote their environmental friendliness.







Abstract
To date, significant efforts have been dedicated to improve their ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes in SPEs is still lacking. Moreover, existing thermosetting SPEs are hardly degradable. Herein, by overcoming the limitation predicted by Flory theory, self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)&#8208;based SPEs (HPAE&#8208;SPEs) are reported. HPAE is successfully synthesized through a well&#8208;controlled &#8220;A2+B4&#8221; Michael addition strategy and then crosslinked it in situ to produce HPAE&#8208;SPEs. The multiple tertiary aliphatic amines at the branching sites confer multicolour luminescence to HPAE&#8208;SPEs, enabling direct observation of its physical and chemical damage. After use, HPAE&#8208;SPEs can be rapidly hydrolysed into non&#8208;hazardous &#946;&#8208;amino acids and polyols via self&#8208;catalysis. Optimized HPAE&#8208;SPE exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C, a Na+ transference number (
) of 0.67, a highly stable sodium plating&#8208;stripping behaviour and a low overpotential of &#8776;190&#8197;mV. This study establishes a new paradigm for developing SPEs by engineering multifunctional polymers. The self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable properties would greatly expand the scope of applications for SPEs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Molecular Oxygen by 9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Selective Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the molecule of 9&#8208;fluorenone, by using a cross&#8208;linking agent, a series of porous organic polymers (POPs) were designed and synthesized through Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation. As heterogeneous catalysts, these polymers have good stability, can realize the activation of oxygen under mild and green conditions, and have better performance than 9&#8208;fluorenone in the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
Oxygen activation is a critical step in heterogeneous oxidative processes, particularly in catalytic, electrolytic, and pharmaceutical applications. Among the various catalysts available for photocatalytic O2 activation, homogeneous aryl ketones are at the forefront. To avoid the degradation and deactivation of aryl ketones, 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;based porous organic polymers were designed and regulated by doping them with co&#8208;monomers. The obtained heterogeneous photocatalyst showed good performance in O2 activation, and its performance was better than that of homogeneous 9&#8208;fluorenone. The obtained heterogeneous photocatalyst showed good reusability. We believe that the presented method and findings represent an important step toward designing catalysts tailored for specific tasks.

         <title>Regulating Perovskite Crystallization through Interfacial Engineering Using a Zwitterionic Additive Potassium Sulfamate for Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>

A multifunctional interface engineering is proposed for perovskite crystallization modulation and defect passivation by incorporating a zwitterionic additive potassium sulfamate onto the grain&#8208;growth substrate, leading to pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a champion external quantum efficiency of 17.32&#8201;% at 478&#8197;nm and spectrally stable CIE chromaticity coordinate of (0.106, 0.129).







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites are emerging as efficient emitters in blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), while the imbalanced crystallization of the halide&#8208;mixed system limits further improvements in device performance. The rapid crystallization caused by Cl doping produces massive defects at the interface, leading to aggravated non&#8208;radiative recombination. Meanwhile, unmanageable perovskite crystallization is prone to facilitate the formation of nonuniform low&#8208;dimensional phases, which results in energy loss during the exciton transfer process. Here, we propose a multifunctional interface engineering for nucleation and phase regulation by incorporating the zwitterionic additive potassium sulfamate into the hole transport layer. By using potassium ions (K+) as heterogeneous nucleation seeds, finely controlled growth of interfacial K+&#8208;guided grains is achieved. The sulfamate ions can simultaneously regulate the phase distribution and passivate defects through coordination interactions with undercoordinated lead atoms. Consequently, such synergistic effect constructs quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskite films with smooth energy landscape and reduced trap states, leading to pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.32&#8201;%, spectrally stable emission at 478&#8197;nm and the prolonged operational lifetime. This work provides a unique guide to comprehensively regulate the halide&#8208;mixed blue perovskite crystallization by manipulating the characteristics of grain&#8208;growth substrate.

         <dc:description>
A nanocomposite filler was homogeneously embedded in polymers to fabricate mixed matrix membranes for propylene/propane separation. The combination of facilitated transport and molecular sieving mechanism makes the separation process efficient, as explained by Meixia Shan, Jorge Gascon, Yatao Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316093).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Organocatalytic Lithium Chloride Oxidation by Covalent Organic Frameworks for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 7/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework with catalytic activity is demonstrated to significantly decrease the oxidation barrier and accelerate the oxidation kinetics of LiCl in a rechargeable Li&#8208;Cl2 battery. The developed battery exhibits low overpotential and ultrahigh discharge capacity with good stability in a wide temperature range, as reported by Wei Chen, Shenxiang Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202315931).

         <title>Inside Cover: Artificial Protein Crosstalk with a Molecule that Exchanges Binding Partners (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 7/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional, partner exchanging molecule capable of mediating unnatural protein crosstalk in native (non&#8208;engineered) cells is reported by David Margulies et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e2023112461). This molecule acts as a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) that converts the constitutively active glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) into an activable enzyme triggered by an unnatural protein effector (lactate dehydrogenase A, LDHA). The oxygen&#8208;dependent expression of LDHA renders GSK&#8208;3 activity unnaturally dependent on the cellular hypoxic response.

         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian white material, introducing an innovative concept for developing robust cathodes for use in Na&#8208;ion batteries. In their Research Article (e202315371), Torsten Brezesinski, Ben Breitung, Yanjiao Ma and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that enhanced performance is linked to increased configurational entropy, and a proposed mechanism underscores the synergistic effects of suppressing phase transitions and mitigating gas evolution.

         <title>Reagent Engineering for Group Transfer Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>

Biocatalytic group transfer reactions can efficiently generate highly complex molecules under mild and environmentally friendly conditions. This Minireview highlights inspiring examples of the development of non&#8208;natural donor reagents to power such enzymatic transformations, while discussing the design aspects behind the choice of reagent.







Abstract
Biocatalysis has become a major driver in the innovation of preparative chemistry. Enzyme discovery, engineering and computational design have matured to reliable strategies in the development of biocatalytic processes. By comparison, substrate engineering has received much less attention. In this Minireview, we highlight the idea that the design of synthetic reagents may be an equally fruitful and complementary approach to develop novel enzyme&#8208;catalysed group transfer chemistry. This Minireview discusses key examples from the literature that illustrate how synthetic substrates can be devised to improve the efficiency, scalability and sustainability, as well as the scope of such reactions. We also provide an opinion as to how this concept might be further developed in the future, aspiring to replicate the evolutionary success story of natural group transfer reagents, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM).

         <title>Single Chain Nanoparticles in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>

Single chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are a fascinating macromolecular materials class inspired by natural macromolecules such as enzymes. The current minireview explores their use and potential as versatile catalysts.







Abstract
Over the last six decades folded polymer chains&#8212;so&#8208;called Single Chain Nanoparticles (SCNPs)&#8212;have evolved from the mere concept of intramolecularly crosslinked polymer chains to tailored nanoreactors, underpinned by a plethora of techniques and chemistries to tailor and analyze their morphology and function. These monomolecular polymer entities hold critical promise in a wide range of applications. Herein, we highlight the exciting progress that has been made in the field of catalytically active SCNPs in recent years.

         <title>Small Organic Molecular Electrocatalysts for Fuels Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview, recent efforts to develop electrocatalytic systems consisting of small organic molecules employed for energy relevant reactions such as water oxidation, hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are highlighted.







Abstract
In recent years, heterocyclic organic compounds have been explored as molecular electrocatalysts in relevant reactions for energy conversion and storage. Merging mimetics of biological systems that perform hydride transfer with rational synthetic chemical design has opened many opportunities for organic molecules to be tuned at the atomic level conferring them interesting reactivities. These molecular electrocatalysts represent an alternative to traditional metallic materials and metal complexes employed for water oxidation, hydrogen production, and carbon dioxide reduction. This minireview describes recent reports concerning design, catalytic activity and the mechanism of synthetic molecular electrocatalysts towards solar fuels production.

         <title>Hot or Not? Reassessing Mechanisms of Photocurrent Generation in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8216;hot&#8217; field of much recent interest, plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis offers possibilities for improving selectivity and rates in small molecule activation via non&#8208;thermal &#8216;hot carriers&#8217;. However, critical identification of thermal contributions is often insufficient. Here, we summarise the origins of observed photocurrents and present guidelines to experimentalists for differentiating between enhancement mechanisms.







Abstract
It is now widely accepted that certain effects arising from localised surface plasmon resonance, such as enhanced electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, and thermal effects, can facilitate electrocatalytic processes. This newly emerging field of research is commonly referred to as plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC) and is attracting increasing interest from the research community, particularly regarding harnessing the high energy of hot carriers. However, this has led to a lack of critical analysis in the literature, where the participation of hot carriers is routinely claimed due to their perceived desirability, while the contribution of other effects is often not sufficiently investigated. As a result, correctly differentiating between the possible mechanisms at play has become a key point of contention. In this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms behind photocurrents observed in PEEC and critically evaluate the possibility of alternative sources of current enhancement in the reported PEEC systems. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the best experimental practices and methods to distinguish between the various enhancement mechanisms in PEEC.

         <title>Accessing Pyridines via a Nitrene Internalization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing pyridines by directly and selectively replacing a C&#8208;atom from aromatic ring systems with a nitrogen remains underexplored, while also being crucial for nitrogen scans in drug discovery processes. In this direction, a recent contribution by Levin's group involving the one&#8208;pot nitrene internalization reaction for ipso&#8208;selective C&#8208;to&#8208;N transmutation provides a direct access to pyridyl isomers.







Abstract
Pyridines are valuable pharmacophores, and their access via direct and selective transmutation of carbon atom with desired nitrogen could become crucial in drug discovery processes. However, only scarce examples can be found when it comes C&#8208;to&#8208;N&#8208;transmutation reactions of aromatics that could lead to the facile synthesis of pyridines or other azaarenes. In this context, Levin and co&#8208;workers recently disclosed a process leading to pyridines from the corresponding aryl azides via the regioselective nitrene internalization process. Notably, the transformation did not lead to any further modification of the rest of the aromatic skeleton. This innovative work enabled selectively accessing various pyridine derivatives through direct nitrogen scan operations on benzene derivatives, which were otherwise not feasible.

Pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries. This article reviews the progress on the development of pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries from the full cell aspect and provides our perspectives for future advancements. It introduces the key performance criteria and major challenges of pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries and covers the advances of both anode and cathode (insertion and conversion&#8208;type) in pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries with liquid or solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; in the energy storage field due to their high energy density (theoretically &gt;500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to promote the research &amp; development (R&amp;D) of pouch&#8208;type LMBs toward practical application. This article aims to provide a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth review of recent progress on pouch&#8208;type LMBs from full cell aspect, and to offer insights to guide its future development. It will review pouch&#8208;type LMBs using both liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and cover topics related to both Li and cathode (including LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2, S and O2) as both electrodes impact the battery performance. The key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs and their relationship in between are introduced first, then the major challenges facing the development of pouch&#8208;type LMBs are discussed in detail, especially those severely aggravated in pouch cells compared with coin cells. Subsequently, the recent progress on mechanistic understandings of the degradation of pouch&#8208;type LMBs is summarized, followed with the practical strategies that have been utilized to address these issues and to improve the key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs. In the end, it provides perspectives on advancing the R&amp;Ds of pouch&#8208;type LMBs towards their application in practice.

         <title>Enabling Polymer Single Crystals to Be High&#8208;Performance Dielectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking polyethylene as example, hundred&#8208;microns&#8208;size polymer lamellar single crystals (PLSC) are obtained. And the PLSC is applied as dielectric in MIM capacitor with a non&#8208;destructive strategy. The PLSC based nanometer capacitor exhibits exceptional dielectric properties with a high breakdown strength and a low dielectric constant.







Abstract
Semicrystalline polymer dielectrics (SPDs) are highly sought&#8208;after state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dielectric materials. As the disorder in SPDs degrades their electrical properties, homogeneously ordered SPDs are desired. However, complex crystallization behaviors of polymers make such homogeneity elusive. Polymer lamellar single crystals (PLSCs), the most regularly&#8208;ordered form of SPDs possible under mild crystallizing conditions, are ideal platforms for understanding and developing high&#8208;performance dielectric materials. Here, a typical and widely used SPD, polyethylene (PE) is selected as the model material. We successfully obtained, large, uniform, and high&#8208;quality PE PLSCs and devised a non&#8208;destructive strategy to construct PE PLSC&#8208;based vertical capacitors. These nanometer&#8208;thick capacitors exhibit exceptional dielectric properties, with a high breakdown strength of 6.95 MV/cm and a low dielectric constant of 2.14&#177;0.07, that outperform the properties of any existing neat PE. This work provides novel insights into exploring the performance possibility of ordered SPDs and reveals the PLSCs as potential high&#8208;performance dielectric materials.

         <title>Realizing Low&#8208;Temperature Graphite&#8208;based Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational electrolyte design, highly reversible low&#8208;temperature potassium storage in graphite anode has been achieved for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared graphite&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion full battery can reversibly charge/discharge in a wide temperature range between &#8722;30 and 45&#8201;&#176;C with a considerable energy density of 197&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode &#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr) has been considered as the most promising anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) commercialization due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, Gr&#8208;based PIBs remain unfeasible at low temperature (LT), suffering from either poor kinetics based on conventional carbonate electrolytes or K+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation issue based on typical ether electrolytes. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Gr&#8208;based LT rechargeable PIB is realized for the first time by electrolyte chemistry. Applying unidentate&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecule as the solvent dramatically weakens the K+&#8208;solvent interactions and lowers corresponding K+ de&#8208;solvation kinetic barrier. Meanwhile, introduction of steric hindrance suppresses co&#8208;intercalation of K+&#8208;solvent into Gr, greatly elevating operating voltage and cyclability of the full battery. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Gr||prepotassiated 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylicacid&#8208;dianhydride (KPTCDA) full PIB can reversibly charge/discharge between &#8722;30 and 45&#8201;&#176;C with a considerable energy density up to 197&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, hopefully facilitating the development of LT PIBs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;SF5&#8208;Indenols and Further Derivatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is described a fully regioselective synthesis of SF5&#8208;indenols using commercially available boronic acid derivatives. This reaction is characterized by high functional group compatibility, and a broad substrate scope. A selection of downstream functionalizations has been performed to highlight the versatility of 2&#8208;SF5 indenol and its use as platforms for the design of more complex SF5&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of 2&#8208;SF5&#8208;indenols has been developed by reacting commercially available boronic acid derivatives and readily accessible SF5&#8208;alkynes. The present methodology is fully regioselective thanks to the intrinsic polarization of SF5&#8208;alkynes. A selection of downstream functionalizations has been performed to highlight the versatility of 2&#8208;SF5&#8208;indenols and indenones as platforms for the design of more complex SF5&#8208;containing molecules.

The cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;NHK (Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi) reaction of ketimine has been realized to access diverse &#945;&#8208;tertiary vinylic amino esters with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Notably, both configuration of alkenyl halide provides the same stereochemical outcome of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkenyl quaternary amino ester, indicating that isomerization of alkenyl fragment might be involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Chromium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction represents one of the most powerful approaches for the formation of chiral carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond. However, the construction of sterically encumbered tetrasubstituted stereocenter through NHK reaction still posts a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;NHK reaction of ketimine with alkenyl halide to provide a convenient synthetic approach for the manufacture of enantioenriched tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;vinylic amino acid. This protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance with excellent 99&#8201;% ee in most cases. Additionally, this asymmetric reductive method is also applicable to the aldimine to access the trisubstituted stereogenic centers.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Iridium(III) and Iridium(IV) Oxo Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation by two isostructural, terminal iridium(III) and iridium(IV) oxo complexes is compared. While the driving forces for hydrogen abstraction are almost identical due to compensating contributions from H+ and e&#8722; transfer, significant differences in hydrogen tunneling were observed. Increased tunneling for the iridium(III) oxo complex is attributed to its higher basicity, which leads to a narrower potential energy barrier. Our results provide guidelines to steer C&#8722;H activation under tunneling control.







Abstract
Oxidation of an iridium(III) oxo precursor enabled the structural, spectroscopic, and quantum&#8208;chemical characterization of the first well&#8208;defined iridium(IV) oxo complex. Side&#8208;by&#8208;side examination of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer thermochemistry revealed similar driving forces for the isostructural oxo complexes in two redox states due to compensating contributions from H+ and e&#8722; transfer. However, C&#8722;H activation of dihydroanthracene revealed significant hydrogen tunneling for the distinctly more basic iridium(III) oxo complex. Our findings complement the growing body of data that relate tunneling to ground state properties as predictors for the selectivity of C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Multicomponent Cyclizative 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement Enabled Enantioselective Construction of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Pyrrolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangement is established, which provides a straightforward access to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolinones in excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. This reaction also represents the first example of asymmetric catalytic construction of chiral pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;rearrangement reaction is one of the most important approaches to construct carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in organic synthesis. However, the development of catalytic asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is still far from mature and often suffers from problems such as complex substrates, single product structure, and lack of synthetic application. Multicomponent reaction has been recognized as a robust tool for the synthesis of diverse and tunable products from readily available starting material. Conceptionally and practically, the development of multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is highly desirable. In this regard, we report herein a three&#8208;component benzilic acid&#8208;type rearrangement of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, aromatic amines and aldehydes for the asymmetric construction of synthetically challenging pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. To the best of our knowledge, this reaction represents the first example of organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements.

         <title>Atomically Precise Silver Clusters Stabilized by Lacunary Polyoxometalates with Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two atomically precise Ag clusters stabilized by lacunary polyoxometalates have been successfully synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach, the resulting POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.







Abstract
The syntheses of atomically precise silver (Ag) clusters stabilized by multidentate lacunary polyoxometalate (POM) ligands have been emerging as a promising but challenging research direction, the combination of redox&#8208;active POM ligands and silver clusters will render them unexpected geometric structures and catalytic properties. Herein, we report the successful construction of two structurally&#8208;new lacunary POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters, TBA6H14Ag14(DPPB)4(CH3CN)9[Ag24(Si2W18O66)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10CH3CN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O ({Ag24(Si2W18O66)3}, TBA=tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium, DPPB=1,4&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane) and TBA14H6Ag9Na2(H2O)9[Ag27(Si2W18O66)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8CH3CN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O ({Ag27(Si2W18O66)3}), using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Under otherwise identical synthetic conditions, the molecular structures of two POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters could be readily tuned by the addition of different organic ligands. In both compounds, the central trefoil&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped {Ag24}14+ and {Ag27}17+ clusters bearing 10 delocalized valence electrons are stabilized by three C&#8208;shaped {Si2W18O66} units. The femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the rapid charge transfer between {Ag24}14+ core and {Si2W18O66} ligands. Both compounds have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzoxasiloles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasiloles has been realized via the intramolecular Si&#8722;O coupling of [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes using Cu(I)/difluorphos as the efficient catalytic system. Kinetic resolution of racemic substituted [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes using Cu(I)/PyrOx as the catalytic system was also achieved to afford carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasilole species.

A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasiloles has been realized via intramolecular Si&#8722;O coupling of [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes. Cu(I)/difluorphos is found to be an efficient catalytic system for enantioselective Si&#8722;C bond cleavage and Si&#8722;O bond formation. In addition, kinetic resolution of racemic substituted [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes using Cu(I)/ PyrOx (pyridine&#8208;oxazoline ligands) as the catalytic system is developed to afford carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzoxasiloles. Ring&#8208;opening reactions of chiral benzoxasiloles with organolithiums and Grignard reagents yield various enantioenriched functionalized tetraorganosilanes.

         <title>Simple Molecules under High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Conditions: Synthesis and Characterization of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2 with Fully sp3&#8208;Hybridized Carbon</title>

Malononitrile, dicyandiamide, and melamine were subjected to high pressures and temperatures in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, mimicking conditions that prevail inside Uranus and Neptune. This yielded &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2, both with fully sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. The former adopts a distorted &#946;&#8208;cristobalite structure, while the latter is built from imide&#8208;bridged hexaazaadamantane units, which form two interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like networks.







Abstract
The elements hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen are among the most abundant in the solar system. Still, little is known about the ternary compounds these elements can form under the high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions found in the outer planets&#8217; interiors. These materials are also of significant research interest since they are predicted to feature many desirable properties such as high thermal conductivity and hardness due to strong covalent bonding networks. In this study, the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction behavior of malononitrile H2C(CN)2, dicyandiamide (H2N)2C=NCN, and melamine (C3N3)(NH2)3 was investigated in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. Two previously unknown compounds, namely &#945;&#8208;C(NH)2 and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2, have been synthesized and found to have fully sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. &#945;&#8208;C(NH)2 crystallizes in a distorted &#946;&#8208;cristobalite structure, while &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2 is built from previously unknown imide&#8208;bridged 2,4,6,8,9,10&#8208;hexaazaadamantane units, which form two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like networks. Their stability domains and compressibility were studied, for which supporting density functional theory calculations were performed.

Luban locks with mortise and tenon structure have structural diversity and architectural stability, and it is extremely challenging to synthesize Luban lock&#8208;like structures at the molecular level. In this work, we report the cocrystallization of two structurally homologous atom&#8208;precise fcc silver nanoclusters Ag110(SPhF)48(PPh3)12 (Ag110) and Ag14(&#956;6&#8208;S)(SPhF)12(PPh3)8 (Ag14). The Ag110 cluster is the first compound to simulate the complex Luban lock structure at the molecular level.







Abstract
Luban locks with mortise and tenon structure have structural diversity and architectural stability, and it is extremely challenging to synthesize Luban lock&#8208;like structures at the molecular level. In this work, we report the cocrystallization of two structurally related atom&#8208;precise fcc silver nanoclusters Ag110(SPhF)48(PPh3)12 (Ag110) and Ag14(&#956;6&#8208;S)(SPhF)12(PPh3)8 (Ag14). It is worth noting that the Ag110 cluster is the first compound to simulate the complex Luban lock structure at the molecular level. Meanwhile, Ag110 is the largest known fcc&#8208;based silver nanocluster, so far, there is no precedent for fcc silver nanocluster with more than 100 silver atoms. DFT calculations show that Ag110 is a 58&#8208;electron superatom with an electronically closed shell1S21P61D102S21F142P61G18. Ag110&#8901;Ag14 can rapidly catalyze the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol within 4&#8197;minutes. In addition, Ag110 presents clear structural evidence to reveal the critical size and mechanism of the transformation of metal core from fcc stacking to quasi&#8208;spherical superatom. This research work provides an important structural model for studying the nucleation mechanism and structural assembly of silver nanoclusters.

         <title>Realizing Persistent Zero Area Compressibility over a Wide Pressure Range in Cu2GeO4 by Microscopic Orthogonal&#8208;Braiding Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By a microscopic orthogonal&#8208;braiding strategy, the rare occurring zero area compressibility (ZAC) is rationally identified in Cu2GeO4, and its mechanism is attributed to an in&#8208;to&#8208;out plane charge transfer within the planar [CuO4] group under pressure.







Abstract
Zero area compressibility (ZAC) is an extremely rare mechanical response that exhibits an invariant two&#8208;dimensional size under hydrostatic pressure. All known ZAC materials are constructed from units in two dimensions as a whole. Here, we propose another strategy to obtain the ZAC by microscopically orthogonal&#8208;braiding one&#8208;dimensional zero compressibility strips. Accordingly, ZAC is identified in a copper&#8208;based compound with a planar [CuO4] unit, Cu2GeO4, that possesses an area compressibility as low as 1.58(26) TPa&#8722;1 over a wide pressure range from &#8776;0&#8197;GPa to 21.22&#8197;GPa. Based on our structural analysis, the subtle counterbalance between the shrinkage of [CuO4] and the expansion effect from the increase in the [CuO4]&#8208;[CuO4] dihedral angle attributes to the ZAC response. High&#8208;pressure Raman spectroscopy, in combination with first&#8208;principles calculations, shows that the electron transfer from in&#8208;plane bonding dx2&#8208;y2 to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nonbonding dz2 orbitals within copper atoms causes the counterintuitive extension of the [CuO4]&#8208;[CuO4] dihedral angle under pressure. Our study provides an understanding on the pressure&#8208;induced structural evolution of copper&#8208;based oxides at an electronic level and facilitates a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;dimensional anomalous mechanical materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Azahomocorannulenyl Cations and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tropyl ions and radicals are representative non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons that offer interesting properties, but their synthesis has been rather limited. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended azahomocorannulene molecules possessing a tropyl cation or radical unit have now been synthesized and their electronic and optical properties were investigated.







Abstract
Cycloheptatrienyl (tropyl) molecules are representative non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons that offer interesting chemistry because of their unique structures and properties. However, there have been a limited number of polycyclic aromatic tropyl cations and radicals reported in the literature. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of azahomocorannulene derivatives, where the key reactions are a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylides with dibenzotropone and a subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the obtained azahomocorannulenyl cation and radical adopt planar structures and exhibit unique packing structures. Their electronic and optical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically to reveal their aromatic character.

         <title>2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets based on Pd&#8208;TCPP as Photocatalysts for Highly Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 7, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MOFs with coordinated Pd and Pt single atom sites show a striking difference in photocatalytic performance&#8212;Pd&#8208;MOF outperforms Pt&#8208;MOF over all light wavelengths, even though they have identical coordination and similar light absorption characteristics. The remarkable efficiency of Pd MOFs is ascribed to enhanced charge transfer and extended carrier lifetime.







Abstract
In this report, a 2D MOF nanosheet derived Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst, denoted as Pd&#8208;MOF, was fabricated and examined for visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This Pd&#8208;MOF can provide a remarkable photocatalytic activity (a H2 production rate of 21.3&#8197;mmol/gh in the visible range), which outperforms recently reported Pt&#8208;MOFs (with a H2 production rate of 6.6&#8197;mmol/gh) with a similar noble metal loading. Notably, this high efficiency of Pd&#8208;MOF is not due to different chemical environment of the metal center, nor by changes in the spectral light absorption. The higher performance of the Pd&#8208;MOF in comparison to the analogue Pt&#8208;MOF is attributed to the longer lifetime of the photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and higher charge transfer efficiency.

         <title>Supramolecular Genome Editing: Targeted Delivery and Endogenous Activation of CRISPR/Cas9 by Dynamic Host&#8208;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesize supramolecular poly(disulfide) (CPS) containing covalently attached cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), which is exploited not only as a carrier to deliver plasmid DNA encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9), but also as a host to include trimethoprim (TMP) by CB[7] moieties through the supramolecular complexation to form TMP@CPS/dsCas9. Once the plasmid is transfected into tumor cells by CPS, the presence of polyamines can competitively trigger the decomplexation of TMP@CPS, thereby displacing and releasing TMP from CB[7] to stabilize dsCas9 that can target and edit the genomic locus of PLK1 to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Following the systemic administration of TMP@CPS/dsCas9 decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA), tumor&#8208;specific editing of PLK1 was detected due to the elevated polyamines in tumor microenvironment, greatly minimizing off&#8208;target editing in healthy tissues and non&#8208;targeted organs. As the metabolism of polyamines is dysregulated in a wide range of disorders, this study offers a supramolecular approach to precisely control CRISPR/Cas9 functions under particular pathological contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore Zeolite for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites hold significant promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. However, the low stability and insufficient exposure of&#160;active sites&#160;impair their catalytic efficiency. Herein, we utilized an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for boosting hydrogen iodide splitting. The as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 featured sufficiently exposed active sites, superior stability, along with&#160;extra&#8208;large pores of ZEO&#8208;1 that were favorable for adsorption and diffusion. Most importantly, the unique nanoconfinement effect of ZEO&#8208;1 led to the narrowing of the band gap of CsPbBr3, allowing for more efficient light utilization. As a result, the photocatalytic HER rate of the as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 photocatalyst was increased to 1734 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1, and the long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, Pt was incorporated with well&#8208;dispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into ZEO&#8208;1, resulting in a significant enhancement in activity. Further investigation revealed that the&#160;boosted photocatalytic performance of Pt/CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 could be attributed to the promotion of charge separation and transfer, as well as to the substantially lowered energy barrier for HER. This work highlights the advantage of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites as the nanoscale platform to accommodate multiple photoactive components, opening up promising prospects in the design and exploitation of novel zeolite&#8208;confined photocatalysts for energy harvesting and storage.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites hold significant promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. However, the low stability and insufficient exposure of&#160;active sites&#160;impair their catalytic efficiency. Herein, we utilized an extra-large-pore zeolite ZEO-1 as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for boosting hydrogen iodide splitting. The as-prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO-1 featured sufficiently exposed active sites, superior stability, along with&#160;extra-large pores of ZEO-1 that were favorable for adsorption and diffusion. Most importantly, the unique nanoconfinement effect of ZEO-1 led to the narrowing of the band gap of CsPbBr3, allowing for more efficient light utilization. As a result, the photocatalytic HER rate of the as-prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO-1 photocatalyst was increased to 1734 &#956;mol&#183;h-1&#183;g-1, and the long-term stability. Furthermore, Pt was incorporated with well-dispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into ZEO-1, resulting in a significant enhancement in activity. Further investigation revealed that the&#160;boosted photocatalytic performance of Pt/CsPbBr3@ZEO-1 could be attributed to the promotion of charge separation and transfer, as well as to the substantially lowered energy barrier for HER. This work highlights the advantage of extra-large-pore zeolites as the nanoscale platform to accommodate multiple photoactive components, opening up promising prospects in the design and exploitation of novel zeolite-confined photocatalysts for energy harvesting and storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Highly Robust Full&#8208;Color Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Stable White Organic Afterglow from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials have been developed by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into a melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer by solution polymerization. Their afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively. Moreover, the resulting polymer films showed a color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow and outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances.







Abstract
In this work, full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively, under ambient conditions. For the coronene&#8208;doped sample, its afterglow color could be linearly tuned between yellow and blue by adjusting the temperature, and it could still emit an intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68&#8197;s at 440&#8197;K. Moreover, the films showed a bright and stable white afterglow at 370&#8197;K with a lifetime of 2.80&#8197;s and maintained an excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150&#8197;days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting was also demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Formation of Pd&#8208;DNA Hybrids Using Tailored Palladium&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Towards Heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective creation of Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structures using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208; hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) highlights its enhanced affinity for cytosine compared to the previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] (Cheld=chelidamic acid). The resulting assembly mimics a natural DNA double helix, with the [Pd(Aqa)(Cytosine)] units acting as metal&#8208;mediated base pairs and offers the potential for heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids.@CanalUGR/@Galindo_Lab







Abstract
The formation of highly organized metal&#8208;DNA structures has significant implications in bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology and material science due to their unique properties and potential applications. In this study, we report on the conversion of single&#8208;stranded polydeoxycytidine (dC15) into a Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structure using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) through a self&#8208;assembly process. The resulting Pd&#8208;DNA assembly closely resembles a natural double helix, with continuous [Pd(Aqa)(C)] (C=cytosine) units serving as palladium&#8208;mediated base pairs, forming interbase hydrogen bonds and intrastrand stacking interactions. Notably, the design of the [Pd(Aqa)] complex favours the interaction with cytosine, distinguishing it from our previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] complex (Cheld=chelidamic acid). This finding opens possibilities for creating heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids where different complexes specifically bind to nucleobases. We confirmed the Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structural assembly and selective binding of the complexes using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Transient metallo&#8208;lipidoid assemblies amplify covalent catalysis of aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dissipative supramolecular assemblies are hallmarks of living systems, contributing to their complex, dynamic structures and emerging functions. Living cells can spatiotemporally control diverse biochemical reactions in membrane compartments and condensates, regulating metabolite levels, signal transduction or remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Herein, we constructed membranous compartments using self&#8208;assembly of lipid&#8208;like amphiphiles (lipidoid) in aqueous medium. The new double&#8208;tailed lipidoid features Cu(II)&#160;coordinated with a tetravalent chelator that dictates the binding of two amphiphilic ligands in&#160;cis&#8208;orientation. Hydrophobic interactions between the lipidoids coupled with intermolecular hydrogen bonding led to a well&#8208;defined bilayer vesicle structure. Oil&#8208;soluble SNAr reaction is efficiently upregulated in the hydrophobic cavity, acting as a catalytic crucible. The modular system allows easy incorporation of exposed primary amine groups, which augments the catalysis of retro aldol and C&#8211;N bond formation reactions. Moreover, a higher&#8208;affinity chelator enables consumption of the Cu(II)&#160;template leveraging the differential thermodynamic stability, which allows a controllable lifetime of the vesicular assemblies. Concomitant temporal upregulation of the catalytic reactions could be tuned by the metal ion concentration. This work offers new possibilities for metal ion&#8208;mediated dynamic supramolecular systems, opening up a massive repertoire of functionally active dynamic &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Dependent Labeling of Organelles with a Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Phosphorus&#8208;Bridged Rhodamine Dye in Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores that have both excellent chemical stability and photostability, as well as efficient cell permeability, is highly demanded. In this study, we present phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes which display significantly improved performance for protein labeling. This is achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the xanthene scaffold. The resulting&#160;cis&#160;and&#160;trans&#160;isomers were successfully isolated and structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction. The HaloTag ligand conjugates of the two isomers exhibited different staining abilities in live cells. While the&#160;cis&#160;isomer showed non&#8208;specific accumulation on the organelle membranes, the&#160;trans&#160;isomer selectively labeled the HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins, enabling the long&#8208;term imaging of cell division and the 5&#8208;color imaging of cell organelles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the HaloTag ligand conjugates within the lipid membrane suggested that the&#160;cis&#160;isomer is more prone to forming oligomers in the membrane. In contrast, the oligomerization of the&#160;trans&#160;isomer is effectively suppressed by its interaction with the lipid molecules. By taking advantage of the superior labeling performance of the&#160;trans&#160;isomer and its NIR&#8208;emissive properties, multi&#8208;color time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution 3D imaging, namely super&#8208;resolution 5D&#8208;imaging, of the interconnected network between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was achieved in living cells.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores that have both excellent chemical stability and photostability, as well as efficient cell permeability, is highly demanded. In this study, we present phospha-rhodamine (POR) dyes which display significantly improved performance for protein labeling. This is achieved by incorporating a 2-carboxy-3-benzothiophenyl group at the 9-position of the xanthene scaffold. The resulting&#160;cis&#160;and&#160;trans&#160;isomers were successfully isolated and structurally characterized using X-ray diffraction. The HaloTag ligand conjugates of the two isomers exhibited different staining abilities in live cells. While the&#160;cis&#160;isomer showed non-specific accumulation on the organelle membranes, the&#160;trans&#160;isomer selectively labeled the HaloTag-fused proteins, enabling the long-term imaging of cell division and the 5-color imaging of cell organelles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the HaloTag ligand conjugates within the lipid membrane suggested that the&#160;cis&#160;isomer is more prone to forming oligomers in the membrane. In contrast, the oligomerization of the&#160;trans&#160;isomer is effectively suppressed by its interaction with the lipid molecules. By taking advantage of the superior labeling performance of the&#160;trans&#160;isomer and its NIR-emissive properties, multi-color time-lapse super-resolution 3D imaging, namely super-resolution 5D-imaging, of the interconnected network between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was achieved in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Visualization of Lithium Plating/Stripping Tuned by On&#8208;site Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) plating/stripping behavior is directly related to the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLBs). However, the complex processes at solid&#8208;solid interfaces are embedded under the solid electrolyte making it challenging to in situ analyze the real&#8208;time and dynamic processes. Here, using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, we directly visualized the Li plating/stripping/replating behavior and measured the morphological/mechanical properties of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at nanoscale. Li spheres plating/stripping/replating at the argyrodite solid electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl)/Li electrode interface is coupled with the formation/wrinkling/inflating of the SEI on its surface. Combined with in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, stepwise formation details and physicochemical properties of SEI on the Li spheres are obtained. It&#8217;s shown that large operating rates reduce the Li+&#8208;conducting networks in the SEI and worsen Li plating/stripping reversibility, while low operating rates reduce Li plating sites. Accordingly, the number of Li nucleation sites and reversibility of plating/stripping process could be effectively improved by regulation of applied current rate to reduce the overpotential and extend the cycling life. In situ analysis of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at solid&#8208;solid interfaces provided the correlation between the interfacial evolution and the electrochemical performance in ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Meltable Aluminum Molecular Rings with Fluorescence and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of meltable aluminum molecular rings with precise lattice doping of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) shows that the abundant, complex and strong hydrogen bonds between the clusters and the DESs components is responsible for the melting behavior. The hot&#8208;press method is used to prepare transparent bubble&#8208;free cluster&#8208;based glass films under autogenous pressure and study their fluorescence and nonlinear optical properties.







Abstract
Crystal&#8211;liquid&#8211;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk&#8208;shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble&#8208;free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot&#8208;press method. These cluster&#8208;based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics. It not only breaks the limitations of crystalline glass on metal and ligand types but also acts as a general guide for extending the range of meltable crystalline materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;lifespan Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitors Enabled by Anodes Integrated with Interconnected Mesoporous Chitosan Membranes through Electrophoresis&#8208;driven Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes are fabricated through electrophoresis. Reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation, endowing zinc ion capacitors with ultra&#8208;high stability.







Abstract
The advancement of highly secure and inexpensive aqueous zinc ion energy storage devices is impeded by issues, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and corrosion of zinc anodes. It is essential to modify the interface of zinc anodes that homogenizes ion flux and facilitates highly reversible zinc planarized deposition and stripping. Herein, by coupling zinc ion coordination with acid&#8208;base neutralization under the driving of electrophoresis, manageable mesoscopic phase separation for constructing chitosan frameworks was achieved, thereby fabricating interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes. The framework is constructed by twisted chitosan nanofiber bundles, forming a three&#8208;dimensional continuous spindle&#8208;shaped pore structure. With this framework, the electrolyte provides exceptional ion conductivity of 25.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with a puncture resistance strength of 2.3&#8197;GPa. In addition, the amino groups of chitosan molecule can make the surface of the framework positively charged. Thus, reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation. As a result, as&#8208;assembled zinc ion capacitor has an excellent cycle life and sustains the capacity by over 95&#8201;% after 20000&#8197;cycles at a current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This research presents a constructive strategy for stable electrolytes&#8208;integrated zinc anodes.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Base Cascades in Zeotype Single Crystal for Sugar Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystal indium&#8208;containing zeolite catalyst with both Lewis acid and base sites intelligently participated in the isomerization of very high concentrations of glucose (33&#8201;%) to fructose in methanol, yielding 54.9&#8201;% fructose and recovering 93.9&#8201;% total sugar following tandem hydrolysis.







Abstract
The chemically catalyzed production of fructose syrup from high concentrations of glucose is crucial for the food industry and biorefining. In this work, a single crystal catalyst was synthesized via protective desilication of zeolite while incorporating indium. Glucose was isomerized in methanol at concentrations as high as 33&#8197;wt&#8201;% before being hydrolyzed with water. The final fructose production was 54.9&#8201;%, with 89.1&#8201;% selectivity and 93.3&#8201;% sugar recovery, the highest isomerization rate at the highest concentration ever reported. Indium was present in the single&#8208;crystal catalyst as oxide nanoparticles and boundary framework atoms, and it achieved intelligent cooperation in the production of fructose syrup in methanol by catalyzing isomerization and selective glycosidation, minimizing degradation due to fructose accumulation and eliminating side reactions. This study contributed to the advancement of the industrial practice of chemically catalyzed glucose isomerization.

         <title>Polar X&#8722;H Bond (X=O, S, N) Activation at a Cage Silanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon anions (silanides) supported by a tridentate nitrogen ligand are shown to undergo oxidative addition of X&#8722;H bonds (X=O, S, N) under mild conditions to form pentacoordinate hydrosilicates.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent silicon compounds such as neutral silylenes display versatile reactivity for the activation of small molecules. In contrast, their anionic congeners silanides ([R3Si&#8722;]) have primarily been investigated for their nucleophilic reactivity. Here we show that incorporating a silanide center in a bicyclic cage structure allows for formal oxidative addition of polar element&#8208;hydrogen bonds (RX&#8722;H, R=aromatic residue, X=O, S, NH). The resulting hydrosilicates were isolated and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations support an ionic mechanism for RX&#8722;H bond activation. Finally, the reactivity of the RS&#8722;H bond adduct was further investigated, revealing that it behaves as a Lewis pair upon facile heterolytic cleavage of the Si&#8722;S bond.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations support an ionic mechanism for RX&#8722;H bond activation. Finally, the reactivity of the RS&#8722;H bond adduct was further investigated, revealing that it behaves as a Lewis pair upon facile heterolytic cleavage of the Si&#8722;S bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hexa&#8208;Substituted Carpyridines into 1D Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recently introduced saddle&#8208;shaped supramolecular unit &#8220;carpyridine&#8221;, which strongly relies on aromatic curvature to self&#8208;assemble, was engineered to form 1D supramolecular polymers. This modified mode of assembly allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the process, including enthalpy values comparable to those of hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems. The minimalism of the molecular design showcases the versatility of curvature in molecular design.







Abstract
The extent of the influence that molecular curvature plays on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymers remains an open question in the field. We began addressing this fundamental question with the introduction of &#8220;carpyridines&#8221;, which are saddle&#8208;shaped monomers that can associate with one another through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and in which the rotational and translational movements are restricted. The topography displayed by the monomers led, previously, to the assembly of highly ordered 2D materials even in the absence of strong directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to gain control over the dimensionality of the formed structures yielding classical unidimensional polymers. These have been characterized using well&#8208;established protocols allowing us to determine and confirm the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of both fibers and sheets. The calculated interaction energies are significantly higher than expected for flexible self&#8208;assembling units lacking classical &#8220;strong&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions. The versatility of this supramolecular unit to assemble into either supramolecular fibers or 2D sheets with strong association energies highlights remarkably well the potential and importance of molecular shape for the design of supramolecular materials and the applications thereof.

         <title>Localized Oxidation Embellishing Strategy Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy is introduced by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on SnO2 electron transport layer in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). The LOE strategy induces plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 on the SnO2 surface, reducing surface oxygen vacancies and realizing benign energy alignment. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 based pero&#8208;SC treated by the LOE strategy achieves power conversion efficiency of 25.72&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) has attracted extensive studies as a promising photovoltaic technology, wherein the electron extraction and transfer exhibit pivotal effect to the device performance. The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed the recent record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero&#8208;SCs, yet still suffers from surface defects of SnO2 nanoparticles which brings energy loss and phase instability. Herein, we report a localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on the SnO2 ETL. The LOE strategy builds up plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 and the nano&#8208;heterojunctions compensate the surface defects and realize benign energy alignment, which reduces surface non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss of the pero&#8208;SCs. Meanwhile, the decrease of lattice mismatch released the lattice distortion and eliminated tensile stress, contributing to better stability of the devices. The pero&#8208;SCs based on &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with the SnO2 ETL treated by the LOE strategy realized a PCE of 25.72&#8201;% (certified as 25.41&#8201;%), along with eminent stability performance of T90&gt;700&#8197;h. This work provides a brand&#8208;new view for defect modification of SnO2 electron transport layer.

         <title>Solid State Machinery of Multiple Dynamic Elements in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexible framework sliding governs the overall dynamical machinery. Moving elements, bicyclopentane, bipyridyls and azo groups, rotate with modulated dynamics in response to chemical stimuli such as I2 vapors and pressurized CO2 diffused into a pillared MOF.







Abstract
Engineering coordinated rotational motion in porous architectures enables the fabrication of molecular machines in solids. A flexible two&#8208;fold interpenetrated pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework precisely organizes fast mobile elements such as bicyclopentane (BCP) (107&#8197;Hz regime at 85&#8197;K), two distinct pyridyl rotors and E&#8208;azo group involved in pedal&#8208;like motion. Reciprocal sliding of the two sub&#8208;networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine&#8208;vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston&#8208;like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra&#8208;fast dynamics (107&#8197;Hz) at temperatures as low as 44&#8197;K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo&#8208;group in a crank&#8208;like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor&#8208;structure interplay.

         <title>H* Species Regulation by Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 for Efficient Nitrate Electro&#8208;reduction in Neutral Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn doped Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst was designed to promote the NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 by accelerating the H* generation from water dissociation and inhibiting the H* binding between each other for hydrogen evolution, which ensures the much enhanced FE (98.9%) and stability (500&#8197;h) for ammonia production.







Abstract
During the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) under neutral condition, the activation of H2O to generate H* and the inhibition of inter&#8208;H* species binding, are critically important but remain challenging for suppressing the non&#8208;desirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Mn&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 (named as Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2) has been synthesized by in situ reconstruction in the electrolyte, which is able to dissociate H2O molecules but inhibits the binding of H* species between each other owing to the increased interatomic spacing by the Mn&#8208;doping. The Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst offers a faradaic efficiency (FE) of as high as 98.9&#177;1.7% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an energy efficiency (EE) of 49.90&#177;1.03% for NH3 production by NO3&#8722;RR, which are among the highest of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, negligible degradation at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been found for at least 500&#8197;h, which is the longest catalytic durations ever reported. This work paves a novel approach for the design and synthesis of efficient NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cyclophanes by Chiral Sulfide Catalyzed Electrophilic Sulfenylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully developed an efficient method for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes through the catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the origin of enantioselectivity in this sulfenylation reaction.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes has been developed for the first time. This was achieved by using a new Lewis base catalyst and a new ortho&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted sulfenylating reagent. Using the substrates with low rotational energy barrier, the transformation proceeded through a dynamic kinetic resolution, and the high rotational energy barrier of the substrates allowed the reaction to undergo a kinetic resolution process. Meanwhile, this transformation was compatible with a desymmetrization process when the symmetric substrates were used. Various planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% ee). This approach was used to synthesize pharmaceutically relevant planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Density functional theory calculations showed that &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between the sulfenyl group and the aromatic ring in the substrate play a crucial role in enantioinduction in this sulfenylation reaction.

         <title>Tailoring the Position of Ester Group on N&#8208;Alkyl Chains of Benzotriazole&#8208;based Small Molecule Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with benzotriazole core&#8208;based fused ring were synthesized by introducing different N&#8208;side chains on the benzotriazole core. The active layers with PM6 as polymer donor and ester side chain SMA BZ&#8208;E31 as acceptor show better phase separation morphology and proper domain size. Finally, The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.33&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side chain engineering plays a vital role in exploring high&#8208;performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs by introducing different N&#8208;substituted alkyl and ester alkyl side chains on benzotriazole (BZ) central unit and aimed to investigate the effect of different ester substitution positions on photovoltaic performances. All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue&#8208;shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain&#8208;based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long&#8208;lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ&#8208;core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.

         <title>Unearthing Superior Inorganic UV Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Materials: A Mineral&#8208;Inspired Method Integrating First&#8208;Principles High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Crystal Engineering</title>

         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking fresnoite&#8208;type solar&#8208;blind UV nonlinear material, Rb2SbFP2O7, with a shortened UV absorption edge, heightened birefringence, and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response, was successfully designed and synthesized through a mineral&#8208;inspired approach integrating first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering.







Abstract
Natural minerals, with their adaptable framework structures exemplified by perovskite and lyonsite, have sparked substantial interest as potential templates for the design of advanced functional solid&#8208;state materials. Nonetheless, the quest for new materials with desired properties remains a substantial challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective and practical synthetic approaches. In this study, we have harnessed a synergistic approach that seamlessly integrates first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering to reinvigorate the often&#8208;overlooked fresnoite mineral, Ba2TiOSi2O7. This innovative strategy has culminated in the successful synthesis of two superior inorganic UV nonlinear optical materials, namely Rb2TeOP2O7 and Rb2SbFP2O7. Notably, Rb2SbFP2O7 demonstrates a comprehensive enhancement in nonlinear optical performance, featuring a shortened UV absorption edge (260&#8197;nm) and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.1&#215;KDP). Particularly striking is its significantly increased birefringence (0.15@546&#8197;nm), which is approximately 30 times higher than the prototype Ba2TiOSi2O7 (0.005@546&#8197;nm). Our research has not only revitalized the potential of the fresnoite mineral for the development of new high&#8208;performance UV nonlinear optical materials but has also provided a clearly defined roadmap for the efficient exploration of novel structure&#8208;driven functional materials with targeted properties.

         <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Harvesting Materials Based on Organic Photovoltaic D/A Heterojunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D/A heterojunction photosensitizers, composed of organic photovoltaic electron donors and acceptors, have been applied in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions and demonstrated an exciting solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. The confronted challenges and possible opportunities are indicated with the aim of boosting research on organic D/A heterojunction photosensitizers further.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a highly promising method to meet the surging energy consumption globally through the environmentally friendly means. As the initial step before photocatalysis, harvesting photons from sunlight is crucially important, thus making the design of photosensitizers with visible even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions get more and more attentions. In the past three years, organic donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunctions with absorptions extending to 950&#8197;nm, have emerged as the new star light&#8208;harvesting materials for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exciting advantages over inorganic materials in solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. This Minireview firstly gives a brief discussion about the principle processes and determining factors for photocatalytic water splitting with organic photovoltaic D/A heterojunction as photosensitizers. Thereafter, the current progress is summarized in details by introducing typical and excellent D/A heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Finally, not only the great prospects but also the most challenging issues confronted by organic D/A heterojunctions are indicated along with a perspective on the opportunities and new directions for future material explorations.

         <title>Photoactivatable Engineering of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Inducible DNAzyme Probe for In Situ Imaging of Nuclear Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;switch DNAzyme system based on nuclear&#8208;localized CRISPR/Cas9 and 470&#8197;nm light activation is reported. The system enabled the in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of metal ions in the cell nucleus.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent probes for imaging metal ions in living cells have received much attention recently. However, employing in situ metal ions imaging within subcellular organelles, such as nucleus, remains a significant challenge. We developed a three&#8208;stranded DNAzyme probe (TSDP) that contained a 20&#8208;base&#8208;pair (20&#8208;bp) recognition site of a CRISPR/Cas9, which blocks the DNAzyme activity. When Cas9, with its specialized nuclear localization function, forms an active complex with sgRNA within the cell nucleus, it cleaves the TSDP at the recognition site, resulting in the in situ formation of catalytic DNAzyme structure. With this design, the CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;inducible imaging of nuclear Zn2+ is demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, the superiority of CRISPR&#8208;DNAzyme for spatiotemporal control imaging was demonstrated by integrating it with photoactivation strategy and Boolean logic gate for dynamic monitoring nuclear Zn2+ in both HeLa cells and mice. Collectively, this conceptual design expands the DNAzyme toolbox for visualizing nuclear metal ions and thus provides new analytical methods for nuclear metal&#8208;associated biology.

&lt;p&gt;DNAzyme-based fluorescent probes for imaging metal ions in living cells have received much attention recently. However, employing in situ metal ions imaging within subcellular organelles, such as nucleus, remains a significant challenge. We developed a three-stranded DNAzyme probe (TSDP) that contained a 20-base-pair (20-bp) recognition site of a CRISPR/Cas9, which blocks the DNAzyme activity. When Cas9, with its specialized nuclear localization function, forms an active complex with sgRNA within the cell nucleus, it cleaves the TSDP at the recognition site, resulting in the in situ formation of catalytic DNAzyme structure. With this design, the CRISPR/Cas9-inducible imaging of nuclear Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, the superiority of CRISPR-DNAzyme for spatiotemporal control imaging was demonstrated by integrating it with photoactivation strategy and Boolean logic gate for dynamic monitoring nuclear Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in both HeLa cells and mice. Collectively, this conceptual design expands the DNAzyme toolbox for visualizing nuclear metal ions and thus provides new analytical methods for nuclear metal-associated biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Tethered Binaphthyl&#8208;Embedded One&#8208;Handed Helical Ladder Polymers: Impact of the Tether Length on Helical Geometry and Chiroptical Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defect&#8208;free 2,2&#8242;&#8208;tethered binaphthyl&#8208;embedded one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers with different tether lengths was synthesized by the modified alkyne benzannulations using the 4&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylethynyl group as the alkyne source. The helical geometries can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the binaphthyl dihedral angle with variations in the alkylenedioxy tethering groups, leading to a strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Synthetic breakthroughs diversify the molecules and polymers available to chemists. We now report the first successful synthesis of a series of optically&#8208;pure 2,2&#8242;&#8208;tethered binaphthyl&#8208;embedded helical ladder polymers based on quantitative and chemoselective ladderization by the modified alkyne benzannulations using the 4&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylethynyl group as the alkyne source, inaccessible by the conventional approach lacking the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents. Due to the defect&#8208;free helix formation, the circular dichroism signal increased by more than 6&#8197;times the previously reported value. The resulting helical secondary structure can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the binaphthyl dihedral angle in the repeating unit with variations in the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;alkylenedioxy tethering groups by one carbon atom at a time. The optimization of the helical ladder structures led to a strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high fluorescence quantum yield (28&#8201;%) and luminescence dissymmetry factor (2.6&#215;10&#8722;3).

         <title>Stabilizing Ni&#8208;rich Single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2 Cathodes using Ce/Gd Co&#8208;doped High&#8208;entropy Composite Surfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, a near surface high&#8208;entropy zone was fabricated into single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2, including a Gd doped LiCeO2 shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. This synergistic effect can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding and formation of intragranular nanocracks.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials for their high reversible capacity, but they suffer from fast structural degradation during cycling. Here, we report the Ce/Gd incorporated single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode materials with significantly enhanced cycling stability. The Gd ions are adequately incorporated in SC&#8208;NCM while Ce ions are prone to aggregate in the outer surface, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;entropy zone in the near&#8208;surface of SC&#8208;NCM, including a Gd doped LiCeO2 (LCGO) shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. The high&#8208;entropy zone can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution and prevent the formation of oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, it leads to a greatly improved H2&#8208;H3 phase transformation reversibility and mitigated stress/strain caused by Li&#8208;ion extraction/insertion during (de)lithiation process. The synergetic effects of reduced oxygen vacancies concentration and mitigated stress/strain can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding as well as the formation of intragranular nanocracks. Consequently, Ce/Gd incorporated SC&#8208;NCM (SC&#8208;NCM@CG2) delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 219.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous All&#8208;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed by matching the S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples with rational electrode potential difference. The aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high specific capacity and discharge voltage, contributing to an enhanced energy density.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising energy storage devices because of their high safety and low cost. However, their energy densities are generally unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of ion&#8208;inserted electrode materials, prohibiting their widespread applications. Herein, a high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge&#8208;carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two&#8208;electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work will widen the scope for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Effects of Deuterium Isotopes on Pt(II) Complexes and Their Impact on Organic NIR Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed general guidelines for the effect of deuterium isotopes on the NIR emission efficiency of Pt(II) complexes and common organic NIR emitters. Also, in this study the NIR OLED based on deuterated Pt(II) complex DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitter attains 796&#8197;nm electroluminescence with EQEmax of 16.6&#8201;% and radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which sets new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt;750&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Insight into effect of deuterium isotopes on organic near&#8208;IR (NIR) emitters was explored by the use of self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) complexes H&#8208;3&#8208;f and HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, and their deuterated analogues D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, respectively (Scheme&#8197;2). In vacuum deposited thin film, albeit having nearly identical emission spectral feature maximized at ~810&#8197;nm, H&#8208;3&#8208;f and D&#8208;3&#8208;f exhibit remarkable difference in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 29&#8201;% and 50&#8201;%, respectively. Distinction in PLQY is also observed for HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (800&#8197;nm, 50&#8201;%) and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (798&#8197;nm, 67&#8201;%). We then elucidated the theoretical differences in the impact on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence between Pt(II) complexes and organic small molecules upon deuteration. The results establish a general guideline for the deuteration on NIR emission efficiency. From a perspective of practical application, NIR OLEDs based on D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitters attain EQEmax of 15.5&#8201;% (radiance 31,287&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 16.6&#8201;% (radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2) at 764&#8197;nm and 796&#8197;nm, respectively, both of which set new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt;750&#8197;nm.

From a perspective of practical application, NIR OLEDs based on D-3-f and DPh-3-f emitters attain EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 15.5&#8201;% (radiance 31,287&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 16.6&#8201;% (radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 764&#8197;nm and 796&#8197;nm, respectively, both of which set new records for NIR OLEDs of &amp;gt;750&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence by Organic Cocrystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic phosphors offer a promising alternative in optoelectronics, but their temperature&#8208;sensitive feature has restricted their applications in high&#8208;temperature scenarios, and the attainment of high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still challenging. Herein, a series of organic cocrystal phosphors are constructed by supramolecular assembly with an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 2.16 s. Intriguingly, remarkable stabilization of triplet excitons can also be realized at elevated temperature, and green phosphorescence is still exhibited in solid state even up to 150 oC. From special molecular packing within the crystal lattice, it has been observed that the orientation of isolated water cluster and well&#8208;controlled molecular organization via multiple interactions can favor the structural rigidity of cocrystals more effectively to suppress the nonradiative transition, thus resulting in efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and unprecedented survival of HTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Copper Nitrenoid Formation and Reactivity Induced by Absorption to an Antenna Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8208;H amination reactions. Further development of this important reaction relies on knowing the properties and reactivity of the nitrenoid intermediates. This work utilizes antenna ligands to form copper nitrenoid complexes and monitor the consecutive C&#8208;H amination reactions under well&#8208;defined single&#8208;molecule conditions in the gas phase. The [Cu(Lphoto)(Lazide)]+ precursors (Lphoto is a bidentate antenna ligand, and Lazide is an organic azide) were stored in an ion trap at 3.5 K and irradiated by visible light, which resulted in denitrogenation of the complex. Further irradiation of the copper nitrenoid led to the consecutive C&#8208;H amination of the antenna ligand. The nitrenoid complexes, as well as the products of the C&#8208;H amination, were characterized by helium tagging IRPD spectroscopy, and the mechanism was described by DFT calculations. This research demonstrates that the antenna ligands can be used to promote the denitrogenation of metal azides in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote further reactivity, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co Metallic Heterostructure as a Highly Active Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline water electrolysis holds promise for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, yet it encounters challenges like high voltage and limited stability at higher current densities, primarily due to inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;based metallic heterostructure (Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co) is designed for excellent water electrolysis. In operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, increasing the available protons for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface optimizes &#916;GH of the nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby enhancing the overall HER performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH&#8208; adsorption rate, coupled with great adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction accelerates electron transport, expediting the afore&#8208;mentioned reaction steps and enhancing water splitting efficiency. The Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance, with a low 1.58 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, and maintains 100% retention over 100 hours at 200 mA cm&#8208;2, surpassing the Pt/C || RuO2 electrolyzer.</dc:description>

         <title>Antenna Effect in Noble Metal&#8208;Free Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Systems Enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, their application in carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction remains limited. Furthermore, current solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs typically employ rhenium complexes as catalysts. In this study, we have developed DSPs that incorporate noble metal&#8208;free components, specifically a zinc&#8208;porphyrin as photosensitizer (PS) and a cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine as catalyst (CAT). Taking a significant stride forward, we have achieved an antenna effect for the first time in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs by introducing a Bodipy as an additional chromophore to enhance light harvesting efficiency. The energy transfer from Bodipy to zinc porphyrin resulted in remarkable stability (turn over number (TON) = 759 vs. CAT), and high CO evolution activity (42 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1vs. CAT).</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Isolated Rhodium(II) Metalloradicals Catalyze Olefin Hydrofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rh(II) porphyrin complexes display pronounced metal&#8208;centered radical character and the ability to activate small molecules under mild conditions, but catalysis with Rh(II) porphyrins is extremely rare. In addition to facile dimerization, Rh(II) porphyrins readily engage in kinetically and thermodynamically facile reactions involving two Rh(II) centers to generate stable Rh(III)&#8208;X intermediates that obstruct turnover in thermal catalysis. Here we report site isolation of Rh(II) metalloradicals in a MOF host, which not only protects Rh(II) metalloradicals against dimerization, but also allows them to participate in thermal catalysis. Access to PCN&#8208;224 or PCN&#8208;222 in which the porphyrin linkers are fully metalated by Rh(II) in the absence of any accompanying Rh(0) nanoparticles was achieved via the first direct MOF synthesis with a linker containing a transition&#8208;metal alkyl moiety, followed by Rh(III)&#8211;C bond photolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Absorption, Fluorescence, Intramolecular Charge Transfer, and Intersystem Crossing in Facilely Synthesized Spiro[fluorene]acridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generations of triplet&#8208;excited, charge transfer (CT), and fluorescent states are appealing for optoelectronic applications. In this work, we prepared a series of electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one (SFDBAO). Our SFDBAOs consist of orthogonally positioned fluorenes and aromatic ketones. By fine&#8208;tuning the substitution of electron&#8208;donating pyrenes, the complex interplay among different excited&#8208;state decay channels and the overall impact of solvents on these decay channels were uncovered. Placing pyrene, for example, at the aromatic ketones resulted in profound solvatochromism in the form of a bright CT emission spanning from yellow to red&#8208;NIR upon going more polar. In contrast, a dark non&#8208;emissive CT was noted upon pyrene substitution at the fluorenes. In apolar solvents, efficient triplet&#8208;excited state generation was observed for all SFDBAOs with singlet oxygen quantum yields (&#934;&#916;) of around 70% albeit different mechanisms were active. Either charge transfer was concluded to mediate the intersystem crossing (ISC) in the case of pyrene substitution or El&#8208;Sayed rule was applicable when lacking pyrene substitution as in the case of SFABAO. In polar solvents, charge separation is the sole decay upon pyrene substitution. Moreover, competition between ISC and CT lowered the triplet&#8208;excited state generation in SFDBAO.</dc:description>

         <title>Gain of Function Recyclable Photoswitches: Reversible Simultaneous Substitution and Photochromism Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of molecular photoswitches has spread to virtually every field of pure and applied chemistry because of the extraordinary level of control they provide over the behavior of matter at smallest scales. Photoswitches possess at least two different states with distinct structures and/or electronics and further functionalization of their core chromophore structures is needed to tailor them for a specific application. In this work we present a different concept for the generation and use of molecular photoswitches. It allows not only simultaneous establishment of photochromism and functionalization, but also full recyclability of a non&#8208;photochromic precursor material. Using a high&#8208;yielding and reversible ammonium salt formation, a functional group is introduced into a symmetric precursor while at the same time a strong electronic push&#8208;pull character is established in the structure. The resulting desymmetrization leads to efficient photoswitching capacity and the functional group can be fully removed subsequently by a simple heating step recovering the precursor for another functionalization round. We finally demonstrate feasibility of this concept over two consecutive closed loop functionalization/photoswitching/recovery steps. This concept offers great potential in any chemical research and application driven area but especially for the creation of responsive reprogrammable materials, no&#8208;background photoswitch labeling, and sustainable chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of S&#8208; and X&#8208;shaped double helicenes exhibit distinct vibrational structures and overall shape variations. In this study, we conducted an in&#8208;depth investigation into the vibronic effects influencing the CPL spectra of two double helicenes, namely DPC and DNH. Employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations utilizing the FC&#8208;HT1|VH model at the CAM&#8208;B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP level, we unveiled the paramount impact of Franck&#8208;Condon (FC), Herzberg&#8208;Teller (HT), and Duschinsky effects on their chiroptical responses. Our research underscores the pivotal role of structural deformations associated with the S1&#8208;to&#8208;S0 electronic transition in molding CPL spectra and wavelength&#8208;dependent dissymmetry factor values, as well as the significance of HT effects in shaping and enhancing CPL responses. This extensive investigation not only advances our comprehension of the vibronic characteristics in configurationally distinct double helicenes but also offers valuable insights for the design of chiral molecules featuring controllable or finely&#8208;tunable CPL responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;(HER).&#160;Throughcontrollable and regioselective&#160;&#946;&#8208;oxidation of Cu porphyrin&#160;1,&#160;we synthesized analogues&#160;2&#8208;4&#160;with one or two&#160;&#946;&#8208;lactone groups in either a&#160;cis&#160;or&#160;trans&#160;configuration. Complexes&#160;1&#8208;4&#160;have the same Cu&#8208;N4&#160;core site but different electronic structures. Although&#160;&#946;&#8208;oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions,&#160;1&#8208;4&#160;displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a CuI&#160;species for&#160;1&#160;to a Cu0&#160;species for&#160;4. This work is thus significant to present mechanism&#8208;controllable HER via electronic tuning of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonyl Molecules Induced Oriented Lithium Deposition&#160;for Long&#8208;Term Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendrites growth and unstable interfacial Li+ transport hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we report an active layer of 2,4,6&#8211;trihydroxy benzene sulfonyl fluorine on copper substrate that induces oriented Li+ deposition and generates highly crystalline solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve high&#8208;performance LMBs. The lithiophilic &#8722;SO2&#8722; groups of highly crystalline SEI accept the rapidly transported Li+ ions and form a dense inner layer of LiF and Li3N, which regulate Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. Thus, Li||Cu cells with lithiophilic SEI achieve an average deposition efficiency of 99.8% after 700 cycles, and Li||Li cells operate well for 1100 h. Besides, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with modified SEI exhibit a capacity retention that is 14 times than that of conventional SEI. Even at &#8722;60 oC, Li||Cu cells reach stable deposition efficiency of 83.2% after 100 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>An ATP "Synthase" Derived from a Single Structural Domain of Bacterial Histidine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a vital energy source for living organisms, and its biosynthesis and precise concentration regulation often depend on macromolecular machinery composed of protein complexes or complicated multi&#8208;domain proteins. We have identified a&#160;single&#8208;domain protein HK853CA derived from bacterial histidine kinases (HK) that can catalyze ATP synthesis efficiently. Here, we explored the reaction mechanism and multiple factors that influence this catalysis through a combination of experimental techniques and molecular simulations. Moreover, we optimized its enzymatic activity and applied it as an ATP replenishment machinery to other ATP&#8208;dependent systems. Our results broaden the understanding of ATP biosynthesis and show that the single CA domain can be applied as a new&#160;biomolecular catalyst used for ATP supply.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Electron Transfer and Redox Site in Boranil Covalent Organic Framework Toward Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient polymeric semiconducting photocatalyst for solar&#8208;driven sluggish kinetics with multielectron transfer oxygen evolution has spurred scientific interest. However, existing photocatalysts limited by &#960;&#8208;conjugations, visible&#8208;light harvest, and charge transfer often compromise the O2 production rate. Herein, we introduced an alternative strategy involving a boranil functionalized&#8208;based fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated ordered donor and acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalyst. The co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 exhibits an excellent ~11&#8208;fold photocatalytic water oxidation rate, reaching 1404 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation compared to pristine Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF (123 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) alone and surpasses to reported organic frameworks counterpart. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the push/pull mechanism (metalloporphyrin/BF2) is responsible for the appropriate light&#8208;harvesting properties and extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation through chelating BF2 moieties. This strategy benefits in narrowing band structure, improving photo&#8208;induced charge separation, and prolonged charge recombination. Further, the lower spin magnetic moment of M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 and the closer d&#8208;band center of metal sites toward the Fermi level lead to a lower energy barrier for *O intermediate. Reveal the potential of the functionalization strategy and opens up an alternative approach for engineering future photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Grafting Ultra&#8208;fine Nanoalloys with Amorphous Skin Enables Highly Active and Long&#8208;lived Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large&#8208;scale deployment of proton exchange membranes water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE) requires a substantial reduction in usage of platinum group metals (PGMs) as indispensable electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ultra&#8208;fine PGMs nanocatalysts possess abundant catalytic sites at lower loading, but usually exhibit reduced stability in long&#8208;term operations under corrosive acidic environments. Here we report grafting the ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys with PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; (c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez) by in situ atomic layer selenation to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and stability. We found that the c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez&#8208;1 with ~ 0.6 nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra&#8208;high mass activity of 26.7 A mg&#8722;1Pt+Ru at &#8722;0.07 V as well as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability maintained for at least 1000 h at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 550 h at &#8722;100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra&#8208;fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular and structural basis for C&#947;&#8208;C bond formation by PLP&#8208;dependent enzyme Fub7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze &#947;&#8208;replacement reactions are prevalent, yet&#160;their utilization of carbon nucleophile substrates is rare. The recent discovery of two PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes,&#160;CndF and Fub7, has unveiled unique&#160;C&#8208;C bond forming capabilities, enabling the biocatalytic synthesis of&#160;alkyl&#8208;substituted pipecolic acids from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine and &#946;&#8208;keto acid or aldehyde derived enolates. This breakthrough presents fresh avenues for the biosynthesis of&#160;pipecolic acid derivatives.&#160;However, the&#160;catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes remain elusive, and a dearth of&#160;structural information hampers&#160;their extensive&#160;application. Here, we have broadened the catalytic scope of&#160;Fub7 by employing&#160;ketone&#8208;derived enolate&#160;as carbon nucleophiles, revealing&#160;Fub7's capacity for substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones. Through an integrated approach combining&#160;X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and computational docking studies, we offer&#160;a&#160;detailed mechanistic insight&#160;into&#160;Fub7 catalysis. Our findings elucidate the structural basis for its&#160;substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity. Our work sets the stage ready for subsequent protein engineering effort aimed at expanding the synthetic utility of Fub7, potentially unlocking novel methods&#160;to access a broader array of noncanonical amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Staggered Assembly of a Dimeric Au13 Cluster: Impacts on Coupling of Geometric Isomerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The specific states of aggregation of metal atoms in sub nanometer&#8208;sized gold clusters are related to the different quantum confinement volumes of electrons, leading to novel optical and electronic properties. These volumes can be tuned by changing the relative positions of the gold atoms to generate isomers. Studying the isomeric gold core and the electron coupling between the basic units is fundamentally important for nanoelectronic devices and luminescence; however, appropriate cases are lacking. Here, the structure of the first staggered di&#8208;superatomic Au25&#8208;S was solved using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The optical properties of Au25&#8208;S were studied by comparing with eclipsed Au25&#8208;E. From Au25&#8208;E to Au25&#8208;S, changes in the electronic structures occurred, resulting in significantly different optical absorptions originating from the coupling between the two Au13 modules. Au25&#8208;S shows a longer electron decay lifetime of 307.7 ps before populating the lowest triplet emissive state, compared to 1.29 ps for Au25&#8208;E. The experimental and theoretical results show that variations in the geometric isomerism lead to distinct photophysical processes owing to isomerism&#8208;dependent electronic coupling. This study offers new insights into the connection between the geometric isomerism of nanosized building blocks and the optical properties of their assemblies, opening new possibilities for constructing function&#8208;specific nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Tailored Polymer Molecular Weights for Specific Photovoltaic Applications through Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Simultaneous Physical and Chemical Events</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly challenging to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymers with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. Once such an easily accessible methodology is established, which can not only contribute to overcome the current limitation of the statistically determined nature of semiconducting polymers, but also facilitate rapid incorporation into the broad synthetic chemists&#8217; toolbox. Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high&#8208;precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers&#8217; molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer&#8208;based devices; as demonstrated in in&#8208;depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics. We believe that this methodology provides a fast development of new and existing semiconducting polymers with the highest&#8208;level performances possible on various photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Detection of BODIPY&#8208;, Biotin&#8208;, and 19F&#8208; Labeled Single&#8208;Entity Dendritic Heparan Sulfate Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are naturally occurring mammalian glycosaminoglycans, and their synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic mimetics have attracted significant interest as potential therapeutics. However, understanding the mechanism of action by which HS, heparin, and HS mimetics have a biological effect is difficult due to their highly charged nature, broad protein interactomes, and variable structures. Here we report that a library of novel single&#8208;entity dendritic mimetics conjugated to BODIPY, Fluorine&#8208;19 (19F), and biotin was synthesized for imaging and localization studies. The novel dendritic scaffold allowed for the conjugation of labeling moieties without reducing the number of sulfated capping groups, thereby better mimicking the multivalent nature of HS&#8208;protein interactions. The 19F labeled mimetics were assessed in phantom studies and were detected at concentrations as low as 5 mM. Flow cytometric studies using a fluorescently labeled mimetic showed that the compound associated with immune cells from tumors more readily than splenic counterparts and was directed to endosomal&#8208;lysosomal compartments within immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled mimetic crossed the blood&#8208;brain barrier and was detectable in brain&#8208;infiltrating immune cells 24 hours after treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to 1000 grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicked catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme. The precise manipulation of neighboring atomic distance dramatically switched the activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating to scavenging ROS, as reported by Hongyu Chen, Hongbing Ji et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316779).

         <title>Cover Picture: Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanodesigned Pt/MnOx interface for enhanced activity in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is reported by Andr&#225;s S&#225;pi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317343). As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) have emerged as highly promising dual&#8208;functional enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts that can initiate the photochemical transformations and achieve distinctive selectivities with multiple noncovalent host&#8211;guest interactions as control forces. This review summaries recent advances of organic transformation using PMOCs as supramolecular reactors through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (ET) processes.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8211;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.

         <title>Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 Oligomerization in Cell Membrane Revealed by Photo&#8208;Activated Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights from super&#8208;resolution microscopy: Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2), a widely used optogenetic tool, forms dimers, not higher oligomers, in human cell membranes. Disruption of inter&#8208;protein disulfide bonds leads to partial ChR2 monomerization, particularly in cells with lower ChR2 densities. This study enhances the understanding of ChR2 oligomerization and assists optogenetic tool design.







Abstract
Microbial rhodopsins are retinal membrane proteins that found a broad application in optogenetics. The oligomeric state of rhodopsins is important for their functionality and stability. Of particular interest is the oligomeric state in the cellular native membrane environment. Fluorescence microscopy provides powerful tools to determine the oligomeric state of membrane proteins directly in cells. Among these methods is quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (qPALM) allowing the investigation of molecular organization at the level of single protein clusters. Here, we apply qPALM to investigate the oligomeric state of the first and most used optogenetic tool Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. ChR2 appeared predominantly as a dimer in the cell membrane and did not form higher oligomers. The disulfide bonds between Cys34 and Cys36 of adjacent ChR2 monomers were not required for dimer formation and mutations disrupting these bonds resulted in only partial monomerization of ChR2. The monomeric fraction increased when the total concentration of mutant ChR2 in the membrane was low. The dissociation constant was estimated for this partially monomerized mutant ChR2 as 2.2&#177;0.9 proteins/&#956;m2. Our findings are important for understanding the mechanistic basis of ChR2 activity as well as for improving existing and developing future optogenetic tools.

         <title>Artificial Homeostasis Systems Based on Feedback Reaction Networks: Design Principles and Future Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review shows how to design feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks in different molecular systems that have a range of non&#8208;linear functions. These networks are a useful set of tools for creating chemical systems and materials that are interactive and have homeostasis&#8208;like animate features. These discoveries pave the way for the development of forthcoming next&#8208;generation systems and materials.







Abstract
Feedback&#8208;controlled chemical reaction networks (FCRNs) are indispensable for various biological processes, such as cellular mechanisms, patterns, and signaling pathways. Through the intricate interplay of many feedback loops (FLs), FCRNs maintain a stable internal cellular environment. Currently, creating minimalistic synthetic cells is the long&#8208;term objective of systems chemistry, which is motivated by such natural integrity. The design, kinetic optimization, and analysis of FCRNs to exhibit functions akin to those of a cell still pose significant challenges. Indeed, reaching synthetic homeostasis is essential for engineering synthetic cell components. However, maintaining homeostasis in artificial systems against various agitations is a difficult task. Several biological events can provide us with guidelines for a conceptual understanding of homeostasis, which can be further applicable in designing artificial synthetic systems. In this regard, we organize our review with artificial homeostasis systems driven by FCRNs at different length scales, including homogeneous, compartmentalized, and soft material systems. First, we stretch a quick overview of FCRNs in different molecular and supramolecular systems, which are the essential toolbox for engineering different nonlinear functions and homeostatic systems. Moreover, the existing history of synthetic homeostasis in chemical and material systems and their advanced functions with self&#8208;correcting, and regulating properties are also emphasized.

         <dc:description>
The ancient art of arranging diatoms (very small algae) under the microscope with a single hair is connected on the Cover picture with the research reported in this Communication (e202318210). The diatoms make up the formula of the disbiradical reported in the study and its characteristic three&#8208;line EPR signal. The milky way in the background represents the through&#8208;space interaction delivering the explanation for the peculiar EPR signal pattern. (Design and idea: Jan Rosenboom).

         <title>Cover Picture: Rapid Synthesis of Chiral Figure&#8208;Eight Macrocycles Using a Preorganized Natural Product&#8208;Based Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile modular synthetic platform was developed to generate chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles exhibiting excellent circularly polarized luminescence, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa, Junpei Yuasa, and Hiroki Oguri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202318548). A preorganized C2&#8208;symmetric scaffold was designed based on natural products such as chimonanthine, isolated from Chimonanthus praecox, to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution.

     alt="Cover Picture: Rapid Synthesis of Chiral Figure-Eight Macrocycles Using a Preorganized Natural Product-Based Scaffold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A versatile modular synthetic platform was developed to generate chiral D2-symmetric figure-eight shaped macrocycles exhibiting excellent circularly polarized luminescence, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa, Junpei Yuasa, and Hiroki Oguri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202318548"&gt;e202318548&lt;/a&gt;). A preorganized C2-symmetric scaffold was designed based on natural products such as chimonanthine, isolated from Chimonanthus praecox, to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14- to 66-membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;selective Carboxylation of Pyridines with CO2 via Pyridylphosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine motifs are widespread pharmacophores in many drugs. Installing various substituents through pyridine C&#8722;H bond functionalization is significant for new drug design and discovery. Developments of late&#8208;stage functionalization reactions enrich the strategies for selective functionalization of pyridines. However, late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines is a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially selectively carboxylation with CO2 on pyridine motifs. Herein, we describe a practical method for C4&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines via one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H phosphination and copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of the resulted phosphonium salts with CO2. The reaction is conducted under mild conditions and compatible with multiple active groups and several pyridine drugs, providing diverse valuable isonicotinic acid compounds, demonstrating the application potential of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioengineered Nanovesicle Vaccine Boosts T&#8208;B cell Interaction for Immunotherapy of Echinococcus multilocularis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease, resulting from being infected with the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed since the current chemotherapy displays limited efficiency in AE treatment. Bioengineered nano cellular membrane vesicles are widely used for displaying the native conformational epitopes because of their unique structure and biocompatibility. In this study, four T&#8208;cells and four B&#8208;cells dominant epitope peptides of E. multilocularis with high immunogenicity were engineered into the Vero cell surface to construct a membrane vesicle nanovaccine for the treatment of AE. The results showed that the nanovesicle vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit E. multilocularis infection. This study presents for the first time a nanovaccine strategy that can completely eliminate the burden of E. multilocularis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored In&#160;Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000 K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8208;Si and Zr&#8208;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2388 K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437 K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogenous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Regulated Generation&#160;of Reactive Oxygen Species from Porphyrin&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel materials for highly efficient and&#160;selective photocatalysis is crucial for their practical applications.&#160; Herein, we employ the host&#8208;guest chemistry of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species and further use them for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols.&#160; Upon irradiation, the sole metallacage (6) can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) effectively via excited energy transfer, while its complex with C70 (6&#8835;C70) opens a pathway for electron transfer to promote the formation of superoxide anion (O2&#183;&#8722;), producing both 1O2 and O2&#183;&#8722;.&#160; The addition of 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine (BPY) to complex 6&#8835;C70 forms a more stable complex (6&#8835;BPY) via the coordination of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin faces of 6&#160;and BPY, which drives fullerenes out of the cavities and restores the ability of 1O2 generation.&#160; Therefore, benzyl alcohols are oxidized into benzyl aldehydes upon irradiation in the presence of 6&#160;or 6&#8835;BPY, while they are oxidized into benzoic acids when 6&#8835;C70 is employed as the photosensitizing agent.&#160; This study demonstrates a highly efficient strategy that utilizes the host&#8208;guest chemistry of metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species for selective photooxidation reactions, which will promote the utilization of metallacages and their related host&#8208;guest complexes for photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Functional Imaging Analysis of Engineered Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional imaging (FI) techniques have revolutionized tumor imaging by providing information on specific tumor functions, such as glycometabolism. However, tumor cells lack unique molecular characteristics at the molecular level and metabolic pathways, resulting in limited metabolic differences compared to normal cells and increased background signals from FI. To address this limitation, we developed a novel imaging technique termed proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) for accurate visualization of tumors. By using "two adjacent chemically labeled glycoproteins" as output signals, we significantly enhance the metabolic differences between tumor and normal cells by PEFI, thereby reducing the background signals for analysis and improving the accuracy of tumor functional imaging. Our results demonstrate that PEFI can accurately identify tumors at the cellular, tissue, and animal level, and has potential value in clinical identification and analysis of tumor cells and tissues, as well as in the guidance of clinical tumor resection surgery.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Cellulose Nanocrystals Electrolyte Additive Enable Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes for Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of aqueous zinc (Zn) chemistry energy storage with high rate&#8208;capability and long serving life is a great challenge due to its inhospitable coordination environment and dismal interfacial chemistry. To bridge this big gap, herein, we build a highly reversible aqueous Zn battery by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions. As a result, the engineered electrolyte system achieves a superior average coulombic efficiency of 97.27% under 140 mA cm&#8208;2, and steady charge&#8208;discharge for 982 h under 50 mA cm&#8208;2, 50 mAh cm&#8208;2, which proposes a universal pathway to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry in green, sustainable, and large&#8208;scale applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Additive Enables High Moisture Tolerance and Favorable Electric Double Layer for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbonate electrolyte chemistry is a primary determinant for the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, their implementation is greatly plagued by sluggish electrode interfacial dynamics and insufficient electrolyte thermodynamic stability. Herein, lithium trifluoroacetate&#8208;lithium nitrate (LiTFA&#8208;LiNO3) dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. We reveal that 1) the in situ generated inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI) enables rapid interfacial dynamics, 2) TFA&#8315; preferentially interacts with moisture over PF6&#8315; to strengthen the moisture tolerance of designed electrolyte, and 3) NO3&#8315; is found to be noticeably enriched at the cathode interface on charging, thus constructing Li+&#8208;enriched, solvent&#8208;coordinated, thermodynamically favorable electric double layer (EDL). The superior moisture tolerance of LTFAN and the thermodynamically stable EDL constructed at cathode interface play a decisive role in upgrading the compatibility of carbonate electrolyte with high&#8208;voltage cathode. The LMBs with LTFAN realize 4.3 V&#8208;NCM523/4.4 V&#8208;NCM622 superior cycling reversibility and excellent rate capability, which is the leading level of documented records for carbonate electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid production at 2 M at an industrial&#8208;level current densities (i.e., 200&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2) for 300 h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice&#8208;distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2% at 1.16 A&#183;cm&#8722;2, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1. To assess the practicality of this system, we perform a comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis and life cycle assessment, showing that our approach can potentially substitute conventional methyl formate hydrolysis for industrial formic acid production. Furthermore, the resultant formic acid serves as direct fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, boasting a power density of 55 mW cm&#8722;2 and an exceptional thermal efficiency of 20.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Conditional Cooperativity in the RAS Assembly Pathway on Nanodiscs and Altered GTPase Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., nanoclusters) of the RAS GTPase on the membrane act as scaffolds that activate downstream RAF kinases and drive MAPK signaling for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of nanoclustering remain largely unknown. Here, size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analyses revealed the structural basis of cooperative assembly processes of fully processed KRAS, mutated in a quarter of human cancers. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition in the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in a nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild&#8208;type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction in a sequential manner. Mutation&#8208;based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and to probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces are available for the assembly. Real&#8208;time NMR demonstrated that higher&#8208;order oligomers retain larger numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster&#8208;enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and to lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Rate Performance of Encapsulating Lithium&#8208;Polysulfide Electrolytes for Practical Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexyl methyl ether (HME) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent to formulate encapsulating lithium&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE). The sacrifice in specific capacity of S cathodes at a high rate in common EPSEs is circumvented in HME&#8208;EPSE while mitigating parasitic reactions of lithium polysulfides with lithium metal anodes. Both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a lithium&#8722;sulfur pouch cell.







Abstract
The cycle life of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is severely plagued by the incessant parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and reactive Li polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating Li&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE) emerges as an effective electrolyte design to mitigate the parasitic reactions kinetically. Nevertheless, the rate performance of Li&#8722;S batteries with EPSE is synchronously suppressed. Herein, the sacrifice in rate performance by EPSE is circumvented while mitigating parasitic reactions by employing hexyl methyl ether (HME) as a co&#8208;solvent. The specific capacity of Li&#8722;S batteries with HME&#8208;based EPSE is nearly not decreased at 0.1&#8197;C compared with conventional ether electrolytes. With an ultrathin Li metal anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) and a high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#8197;mgS&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a longer cycle life of 113&#8197;cycles was achieved in HME&#8208;based EPSE compared with that of 65&#8197;cycles in conventional ether electrolytes at 0.1&#8197;C. Furthermore, both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a Li&#8722;S pouch cell (2.7&#8197;Ah). This work inspires the feasibility of regulating the solvation structure of LiPSs in EPSE for Li&#8722;S batteries with balanced performance.

         <title>High Mobility Emissive Excimer Organic Semiconductor Towards Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was designed and synthesized. Comprehensive experimental characterizations demonstrated that 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal integrated the properties of high mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a strong excimer emission (PLQY: 47.4&#8201;%). More importantly, color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting transistors were also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices with significant potential superiority in smart displays and optical communications. To realize these various applications, it is urgently needed for color&#8208;tunable emission in OLETs, but remains a great challenge as a result of the difficulty for designing organic semiconductors simultaneously integrating high carrier mobility, strong solid&#8208;state emission, and the ability for potential tunable colors. Herein, a high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was reasonably designed by introducing a rotatable carbon&#8211;carbon single bond connecting two anthracene groups at the 2,7&#8208;sites of fluorene, and the small torsion angles simultaneously guarantee effective conjugation and suppress fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the unique stable dimer arrangement and herringbone packing mode of 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal enables its superior integrated optoelectronic properties with high carrier mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and strong excimer emission with absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 47.4&#8201;%. Furthermore, the voltage&#8208;dependent electrically induced color&#8208;tunable emission from orange to blue was also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal based OLETs for the first time. This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color&#8208;tunable OLETs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Formaldehyde&#8208;Nitrate Batteries for Wastewater Refining, Electricity Generation, and Production of Ammonia and Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel multi&#8208;functional formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery, which simultaneously realizes wastewater purification, electricity generation and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NH3 and formate. This battery exhibits an open&#8208;circuit potential of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For simulated industrial wastewater, 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed and an electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated.







Abstract
As bulky pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater, nitrate and formaldehyde pose serious threats to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies including chemical and bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;chemical methods, are generally high&#8208;cost, time&#8208;consuming, or energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report a novel formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery by pairing anodic formaldehyde oxidation with cathodic nitrate reduction, which simultaneously enables wastewater purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia and formate. As a result, the formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery remarkably exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the yield rates of 32.7&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ammonia and 889.4&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formate. In a large&#8208;scale formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery (25&#8197;cm2), 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed from simulated industrial wastewater and the electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated. Moreover, the design of such a multi&#8208;functional battery is universally applicable to the coupling of NO3&#8722; or NO2&#8722; reduction with various aldehyde oxidization, paving a new avenue for wastewater purification and chemical manufacturing.

         <title>A Stable Extra&#8208;Large Pore and High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Derived from Ge&#8208;Rich Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with a multidimensional 28&#8208;MR extra&#8208;large pore channel, has been hydrothermally synthesized from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor, assisted by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Possessing not only superior crystallinity and hydrothermal stability, but also &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS is the high&#8208;silica zeolite containing the largest pore opening to date.







Abstract
A multidimensional extra&#8208;large pore zeolite with highly hydrothermal stability, denoted as &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, has been developed successfully, starting from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor hydrothermally directed by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with the supermicropores, is structurally analogues to 28&#8208;membered ring &#8722;IRT topology as confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. And it is the high&#8208;silica (Si/Ge=58) zeolite with the largest pore size as well. Notably, using acid&#8208;washed as&#8208;made Ge&#8208;rich &#8722;IRT precursor as the silicon source is crucial to restore partially collapsed structure into a stable framework by OSDA&#8208;assisted recrystallization. The calcined &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS maintains a high crystallinity, even when stored in a humid environment for extended periods or directly exposed to water. Additionally, high silica Al&#8208;containing analogue is also readily synthesized, serving as an active solid&#8208;acid catalyst in 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction, yielding an impressive initial conversion up to 76.1&#8201;% much higher than conventional large&#8208;pore Beta zeolite (30.4&#8201;%). This work will pave the way for the designed synthesis of targeted high&#8208;silica zeolites with stable and extra&#8208;large pore frameworks, mimicking the structures of existing Ge&#8208;rich counterparts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Direct Synthesis by Organic Acid&#8208;Etching and Reconstruction Disclosure as Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES) is developed to realize the direct synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), allowing structural transformation to be uncovered during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using in situ characterizations. The reconstructed MOF shows an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons, leading to outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential and good stability.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Chemically bonded MOFs on supports are desirable yet lacking in routine synthesis, as they may allow variable structural evolution and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship to be disclosed. Herein, direct MOF synthesis is achieved by an organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES). Using &#960;&#8208;conjugated ferrocene (Fc) dicarboxylic acid as the etching agent and organic ligand, a series of MFc&#8208;MOF (M=Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) nanosheets are synthesized on the metal supports. The crystal structure is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and low&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy, which is quasi&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched with that of the metal, enabling in situ MOF growth. Operando Raman and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy disclose that the NiFc&#8208;MOF features dynamic structural rebuilding during OER. The reconstructed one showing optimized electronic structures with an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high M&#8722;O bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons on adsorbates indicated by density functional theory calculations, exhibits outstanding OER performance with a fairly low overpotential (130&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and good stability (144&#8197;h). The newly established approach for direct MOF synthesis and structural reconstruction disclosure stimulate the development of more prudent catalysts for advancing OER.

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes for multiplex imaging, by incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds upon click reactions. These modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm, and high turn&#8208;on ratios up to 3184&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable the simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Continuous and In Situ Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Sulfur&#8208;Functionalized Polymer Catalyst for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur functionalized polymer photocatalyst for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production is synthesized through multi&#8208;component reactions. Continuous H2O2 production, photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton water treatment, and natural water sterilization are realized in the panel reactor system under natural sunlight irradiation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water&#8208;mediated and catalyst&#8208;free multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H2O2 production efficiency (3132&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20&#8197;cm) is constructed for large&#8208;scale production of H2O2, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H2O2 utilization efficiency of the photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system using in situ generated H2O2 is found 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of the traditional photo&#8208;Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large&#8208;scale continuous H2O2 photocatalytic production and water treatment.

         <title>Initiating a High&#8208;Rate and Stable Aqueous Air Battery by Using Organic N&#8208;Heterocycle Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[+]	These authors contributed equally to this work.This work reports a strategy of organic&#8208;air batteries which is assembled with organic material as anode directly instead of the traditional metal&#8208;air batteries. Organic N&#8208;heterocycle compounds (NHCC) were synthesized and used as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept anode materials, which exhibits a low redox potential of &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO. Coupling with a 4&#8197;M KOH+10&#8197;M KCF3SO3 electrolyte, the NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries exhibited a high voltage of 1.6&#8197;V and life time of 30,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Alkaline metal&#8208;air batteries are advantageous in high voltage, low cost, and high safety. However, metal anodes are heavily eroded in strong alkaline electrolytes, causing serious side reactions including dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolution. To address this limitation, we successfully synthesized an organic N&#8208;heterocycle compound (NHCC) to serve as an alternative anode. This compound not only exhibits remarkable stability but also possesses a low redox potential (&#8722;1.04&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline environments. To effectively complement the low redox potential of the NHCC anode, we designed a dual&#8208;salt highly concentrated electrolyte (4.0&#8197;M KOH+10.0&#8197;M KCF3SO3). This electrolyte expands the electrochemical stability window to 2.3&#8197;V through the robust interaction between the O atom in H2O molecule with the K+ of KCF3SO3 (H&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;KCF3SO3). We further demonstrated the K+ uptaken/extraction storage mechanism of NHCC anodes. Consequently, the alkaline aqueous NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries delivers a high battery voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, high&#8208;rate performance (101.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle ability (30,000&#8197;cycles). Our work offers a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic anode materials and develops a novel double superconcentrated conductive salt electrolyte for the construction of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle alkaline aqueous organic anode&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Aromatic Ketones as Mild Presodiating Reagents toward Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic ketone Na&#8208;9&#8208;FN&#8208;DME is rationally designed as a mild presodiating reagent by introducing a carbonyl group into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to balance the conjugated and inductive effect, thus demonstrating versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts, Na0.44MnO2 as an example achieves higher charge capacity and longer life after presodiation, and manifests structural stability upon prolonged presodiation time.







Abstract
Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1&#8197;V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over&#8208;sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9&#8208;Fluorenoneb (9&#8208;FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9&#8208;FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.

         <title>Unraveling the Chirality Transfer from Circularly Polarized Light to Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality transfer from light to matter was explored by proceeding with the plasmon&#8208;driven chemical reaction involving chirally distributed hot electrons with achiral Au nanoparticles and circularly polarized light. The chiral light&#8208;matter interactions were unraveled by circular differential scattering spectroscopy at the single particle level and theoretical simulations.







Abstract
Due to their broken symmetry, chiral plasmonic nanostructures have unique optical properties and numerous applications. However, there is still a lack of comprehension regarding how chirality transfer occurs between circularly polarized light (CPL) and these structures. Here, we thoroughly investigate the plasmon&#8208;assisted growth of chiral nanoparticles from achiral Au nanocubes (AuNCs) via CPL without the involvement of any chiral molecule stimulators. We identify the structural chirality of our synthesized chiral plasmonic nanostructures using circular differential scattering (CDS) spectroscopy, which is correlated with scanning electron microscopy imaging at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels. Theoretical simulations, including hot&#8208;electron surface maps, reveal that the plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer is mediated by the asymmetric distribution of hot electrons on achiral AuNCs under CPL excitation. Furthermore, we shed light on how this plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer can also be utilized for chiral growth in bimetallic systems, such as Ag or Pd on AuNCs. The results presented here uncover fundamental aspects of chiral light&#8208;matter interaction and have implications for the future design and optimization of chiral sensors and chiral catalysis, among others.

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized through the two&#8208;step sequential oxidation of readily available imine&#8208;linked COFs, eliminating the requirement for a predesigned OH. This innovative method has high conversion efficiency, crystallinity preservation, and broad applicability, marking a significant advancement in expanding the library of benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8722;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8722;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8722;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8722;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8722;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8722;COFs into BO&#8722;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8722;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>In Vitro Module Editing Of NRPS Enables Production Of Highly Potent Gq&#8208;Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Derived From Unculturable Plant Symbiont</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
YM&#8208;254890, YM&#8208;254891 and FR900359 are potent selective G protein inhibitors. FR900359 which is originally discovered from plant&#8208;symbiont bacteria shows the strongest activity. While YM&#8208;254890 and YM&#8208;254891 are culturable bacteria derived, the BGC for them is not reported. Here, we identified the BGC for YM&#8208;254890 by heterologous expression. Furthermore, rational editing of the BGC led to the production of FR900359 in culturable host.







Abstract
Heterotrimeric G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) that are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes and thus major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. The cyclic depsipeptides YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin. We therefore embarked on constructing an artificial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for FR900359 with YM&#8208;254890 BGC as a template using &#8220;in vitro module editing&#8221; technology, first developed for the modification of type&#8208;I PKS BGCs, to edit YM&#8208;254890 BGC. The resulting artificial BGCs coding FR900359 were heterologously expressed in the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 host strain.

         <title>Bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Reaction&#8208;Triggered Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Combined with Released Lonidamine for Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has been the most deadly disease, and 13 million cancer casualties are estimated to occur each year by 2030. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest due to its high spatiotemporal controllability and noninvasiveness. Due to the trade&#8208;off between particle size and photothermal efficiency of AuNPs, rational design is needed to realize aggregation of AuNPs into larger particles with desirable NIR adsorption in tumor site. Exploiting the bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between iminosydnone and cycloalkyne, aggregation of AuNPs can be achieved and attractively accompanied by the release of chemotherapeutic drug purposed to photothermal synergizing. We synthesize iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) as a prodrug and choose dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as the trigger of BCR reaction. A PEGylated AuNPs&#8208;based two&#8208;component nanoplatform consisting of prodrug&#8208;loaded AuNPs&#8208;ImLND and tumor&#8208;targeting peptide RGD&#8208;conjugated AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD is designed. In the therapeutic regimen, AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD are intravenously injected first for tumor&#8208;specific enrichment and retention. Once the arrival of AuNPs&#8208;ImLND injected later at tumor site, highly photothermally active nanoaggregates of AuNPs are formed via the BCR reaction between ImLND and DBCO. The simultaneous release of lonidamine further enhanced the therapeutic performance by sensitizing cancer cells to PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial&#8211;Equatorial Halide Ordering in Layered Hybrid Perovskites from Isotropic&#8211;Anisotropic&#160;207Pb NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bandgap&#8208;tuneable mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells. The properties of mixed&#8208;halide compositions depend on the local halide distribution, which is challenging to study at the level of single octahedra. In particular, it has been suggested that there is a preference for occupation of the distinct axial and equatorial halide sites in mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites.&#160;207Pb NMR can be used to probe the atomic&#8208;scale structure of lead&#8211;halide materials, but although the isotropic&#160;207Pb shift is sensitive to halide stoichiometry, it cannot distinguish configurational isomers. Here, we use 2D isotropic&#8211;anisotropic correlation&#160;207Pb NMR and relativistic DFT calculations to distinguish the [PbX6] configurations in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 3D FAPb(Br1&#8722;&#119909;I&#119909;)3&#160;perovskites and 2D BA2Pb(Br1&#8722;&#119909;I&#119909;)4&#160;perovskites based on formamidinium (FA+) and butylammonium (BA+), respectively. We find that iodide preferentially occupies the axial site in BA&#8208;based 2D perovskites, which may explain the suppressed halide mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Zn Metal via a Localized Conjugated Layer for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as promising and efficient energy storage systems owing to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. Nevertheless, the instability of zinc metal anodes, characterized by issues such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions, poses a significant barrier to widespread applications. Herein, we address this challenge by designing a localized conjugated structure comprising a cyclic polyacrylonitrile polymer (CPANZ), induced by a Zn2+&#8208;based Lewis acid (zinc trifluoromethylsulfonate) at a temperature of 120 &#176;C. The CPANZ layer on the Zn anode, enriched with appropriate pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich groups (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;), exhibits a notable affinity for Zn2+ with ample deposition sites. This zincophilic skeleton not only serves as a protective layer to guide the deposition of Zn2+ but also functions as proton channel blocker, regulating the proton flux to mitigate the hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the strong adhesion strength of the CPANZ layer guarantees its sustained protection to the Zn metal during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, the modified zinc electrode demonstrates long cycle life and high durability in both half&#8208;cell and pouch cells. These findings present a feasible approach to designing high performance aqueous anodes by introducing a localized conjugated layer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe for High&#8208;Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Copper(II) Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper dysmetabolism is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, making high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging of Cu2+ in the brain essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, the current probes encounter obstacles in crossing the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and providing high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution in deep tissues. Herein, we present a photoacoustic probe capable of imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain with high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution. The probe demonstrates selective ratiometric and reversible responses to Cu2+, while also efficiently crossing the BBB. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully visualized Cu2+ in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) model mouse with a remarkable micron&#8208;level resolution. The imaging results revealed a significant increase in Cu2+ levels in the cerebral cortex as PD progresses, highlighting the close association between Cu2+ alternations in the region and the disease. We also demonstrated that the probe can be used to monitor changes in Cu2+ distribution in the PD model mouse brain during L&#8208;dopa intervention. Mechanism studies suggest that the copper dyshomeostasis in the PD mouse brain was dominated by the expression levels of divalent metal transporter 1. The application of our probe in imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain offers valuable insights into the copper&#8208;related molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Copper dysmetabolism is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, making high-spatiotemporal-resolution imaging of Cu2+ in the brain essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, the current probes encounter obstacles in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and providing high-spatial-resolution in deep tissues. Herein, we present a photoacoustic probe capable of imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain with high-spatiotemporal-resolution. The probe demonstrates selective ratiometric and reversible responses to Cu2+, while also efficiently crossing the BBB. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully visualized Cu2+ in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) model mouse with a remarkable micron-level resolution. The imaging results revealed a significant increase in Cu2+ levels in the cerebral cortex as PD progresses, highlighting the close association between Cu2+ alternations in the region and the disease. We also demonstrated that the probe can be used to monitor changes in Cu2+ distribution in the PD model mouse brain during L-dopa intervention. Mechanism studies suggest that the copper dyshomeostasis in the PD mouse brain was dominated by the expression levels of divalent metal transporter 1. The application of our probe in imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain offers valuable insights into the copper-related molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#160;Nanocloaks on Cancer Cells Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the presence of natural neoantigens, autologous tumor cells hold great promise as personalized therapeutic vaccines. Yet autologous tumor cell vaccines require multi&#8208;step production that frequently leads to the loss of immunoreactive antigens, causing insufficient immune activation and significantly hampering their clinical applications. Herein, we introduce a novel whole&#8208;cell cancer vaccine by cloaking cancer cells with lipopolysaccharide&#8208;decorated manganese(II)&#8208;phenolic networks (MnTA nanocloaks) to evoke tumor&#8208;specific immune response for highly efficacious synergistic cancer immunotherapy. The natural polyphenols coordinate with Mn2+ and immediately adhere to the surface of individual cancer cells, thereby forming a nanocloak and encapsulating tumor neoantigens. Subsequent decoration with lipopolysaccharide induces internalization by dendritic cells, where Mn2+ ions are released in the cytosol, further facilitating the activation of the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway. Highly effective tumor suppression was observed by combining the nanocloaked cancer cell treatment with anti&#8208;programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) antibodies&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our work demonstrates a universal yet simple strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;based nanobiohybrid system for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization.

By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter.

         <title>Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6): A Multi&#8208;Chromophore Chalcogenide with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Property Designed by Group Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro&#8208;optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of Cm. The structure features a unique basic building unit (BBU) [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)], formed through &#8220;grafting [In4Se10] supertetrahedra on the root of [In(P2Se6)2] groups&#8221;. Theoretical calculations confirm that this [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)] BBU can achieve a &#8220;1 + 1 &gt; 2&#8221; combination of properties from two chromophores, [In4Se10] supertetrahedron and ethane&#8208;like [P2Se6] dimer. That makes Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (~6 &#215; AgGaS2), a large band gap (2.45 eV), broad infrared (IR) transmission (up to 19.5 &#956;m), a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064 nm) as well as the congruently&#8208;melting property at ~700 &#176;C. Therefore, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) will be a promising NLO crystal, especially in the IR region, and this research also demonstrates that &#8220;group grafting&#8221; will be an effective strategy for constructing novel polar BBUs with multi&#8208;chromophore to design NCS structures and high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Oxidation in Aqueous&#160;Microdroplets: Water Radical Cation as Primary Oxidizing Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of the unique chemical properties of interfaces can unlock new understanding. A striking example is the finding of accelerated reactions, particularly spontaneous oxidation reactions, that occur without assistance of catalysts or external oxidants at the air interface of both aqueous and organic solutions (provided they contain some water). This finding opened a new area of interfacial chemistry but also caused heated debate regarding the primary chemical species responsible for the observed oxidation. An overview of the literature covering oxidation in microdroplets with air interfaces is provided, together with a critical examination of previous findings and hypotheses. The water radical cation/radical anion pair, formed spontaneously and responsible for the electric field at or near the droplet/air interface, is suggested to constitute the primary redox species. Mechanisms of accelerated microdroplet reactions are critically discussed and it is shown that hydroxyl radical/hydrogen peroxide formation in microdroplets does not require that these species be the primary oxidant. Instead, we suggest that hydroxyl radical&#160;and hydrogen peroxide are the products of water radical cation decay in water. The importance of microdroplet chemistry in the prebiotic environment is sketched briefly and the role of partial solvation in reaction acceleration is noted.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Synergy Enables Silole Insertion into THF and the Synthesis of Erbium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potassium silole K2[SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2] reacts with [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4] (M = Er, Y; COT = cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl) in THF to give products that feature unprecedented insertion of the nucleophilic silicon centre into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. The structure of the major product, [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(m&#8208;L1)K][[EQUATION]] (1M), consists of polymeric chains of sandwich complexes, where the spiro&#8208;bicyclic silapyran ligand [C4H8OSiC4(SiMe3)2Ph2]2&#8211; (L1) coordinates to potassium via the oxygen. The minor product [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(m&#8208;L1)K(THF)]2 (2M) features coordination of the silapyran to the rare&#8208;earth metal. In forming 1M and 2M, silole insertion into THF only occurs in the presence of potassium and the rare&#8208;earth metal, highlighting the importance of bimetallic synergy. The lower nucleophilicity of germanium(II) leads to contrasting reactivity of the potassium germole K2[GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2] towards [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4], with intact transfer of the germole occurring to give the coordination polymers [{&#951;5&#8208;GeC4(SiMe3)2Me2}M(h8&#8208;COT)K][[EQUATION]] (3M). Despite the differences in reactivity induced by the group 14 heteroatom, the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of 1Er, 2Er and 3Er are similar, with thermally activated relaxation occurring via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet, subject to effective energy barriers of 122, 80 and 91 cm&#8211;1, respectively. Compound 1Er is also analysed by high&#8208;frequency dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 106 Hz.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Mono&#8208;N&#8208;Methylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines without the Requirement of External High&#8208;Hydrogen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines has traditionally been challenging, requiring noble metal catalysts and high&#8208;pressure H2 for achieveing satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we developed an approach for the selective coupling of methanol and aliphatic primary amines, without high&#8208;pressure hydrogen, using a manganese&#8208;based catalyst. Remarkably, up to 98% yields with broad substrate scope were achieved at low catalyst loadings. Notably, due to the weak base&#8208;catalyzed alcoholysis of formamide intermediates, our novel protocol not only obviates the addition of high&#8208;pressure H2 but also prevents side secondary N&#8208;methylation, supported by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Catalytic Spinning of Polyethylene Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently immobilized single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst inside nano&#8208;channels of the anodized Al2O3 membrane enables direct catalytic&#8208;spinning of multifilament PE nanofibers near room temperature. Confinement in the nano&#8208;pores has a positive influence on ethylene extrusion polymerization, namely on the chain&#8208;growth and chain&#8208;walking process&#8211;producing high&#8208;performance microstructures and morphologies.







Abstract
A novel single&#8208;atom Ni(II) catalyst (Ni&#8208;OH) is covalently immobilized onto the nano&#8208;channels of mesoporous Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA)&#8208;15 particles and isotropic Anodized Aluminum Oxide (AAO) membrane for confined&#8208;space ethylene extrusion polymerization. The presence of surface&#8208;tethered Ni complexes (Ni@SBA&#8208;15 and Ni@AAO) is confirmed by the inductively coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the catalytic spinning process, the produced PE materials exhibit very homogeneous fibrous morphology at nanoscale (diameter: ~50&#8197;nm). The synthesized PE nanofibers extrude in a highly oriented manner from the nano&#8208;reactors at ambient temperature. Remarkably high Mw (1.62&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1), melting point (124&#8201;&#176;C), and crystallinity (41.8&#8201;%) are observed among PE samples thanks to the confined&#8208;space polymerization. The chain&#8208;walking behavior of surface tethered Ni catalysts is greatly limited by the confinement inside the nano&#8208;channels, leading to the formation of very low&#8208;branched PE materials (13.6/1000&#8197;C). Due to fixed supported catalytic topology and room temperature, the filaments are expected to be free of entanglement. This work signifies an important step towards the realization of a continuous mild catalytic&#8208;spinning (CATSPIN) process, where the polymer is directly synthesized into fiber shape at negligible chain branching and elegantly avoiding common limitations like thermal degradation or molecular entanglement.

         <title>BN&#8208;Isosteres of Nonacene with Antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 Heterocycles: Synthesis and Strong Luminescence
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto longest nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres with antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles embedded in the backbones have been synthesized. The position of the antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 rings remarkably affects the molecular orbital arrangement of the BN&#8208;nonacenes. BN&#8208;3 displays a favorable radiative transition and thus a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of 92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Embedding both boron and nitrogen into the backbone of acenes to generate their isoelectronic structures has significantly enriched the acene chemistry to offer appealing properties. However, only small BN&#8208;heteroacenes have been extensively investigated, with BN&#8208;heptacenes as the hitherto longest homologue. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres via incorporating a pair of antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN&#8208;heteroacenes. The distance between the B2C4 and N2C4 rings affects the contribution of the charge&#8208;separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of BN&#8208;3 is greatly enhanced compared with BN&#8208;1 and BN&#8208;2, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN&#8208;isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.

         <title>Advancements and Perspectives toward Lignin Valorization via O&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;Demethylation (ODM) is a strategic tool to unlock lignin applications for drop&#8208;in and new commodity, fine &amp; specialty chemicals.







Abstract
Lignin represents the largest aromatic carbon resource in plants, holding significant promise as a renewable feedstock for bioaromatics and other cyclic hydrocarbons in the context of the circular bioeconomy. However, the methoxy groups of aryl methyl ethers, abundantly found in technical lignins and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals, limit their pertinent chemical reactivity and broader applicability. Unlocking the phenolic hydroxyl functionality through O&#8208;demethylation (ODM) has emerged as a valuable approach to mitigate this need and enables further applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the progress in the valorization of technical lignin and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals via ODM, both catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic reactions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the properties and potential applications of the O&#8208;demethylated products is presented, accompanied by a systematic overview of available ODM reactions. This review primarily focuses on enhancing the phenolic hydroxyl content in lignin&#8208;derived species through ODM, showcasing its potential in the catalytic funneling of lignin and value&#8208;added applications. A comprehensive synopsis and future outlook are included in the concluding section of this review.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Deep Mineralization of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water resistant S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction is in situ designed. The unique H2O&#8208;resistant AlOOH surface layer is conducive to steering the active species to form the dominant intermediates including benzoic acid and benzaldehyde instead of toxic phenols. These intermediates greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier thus resulting an excellent toluene removal efficiency and a high mineralization rate.







Abstract
Deep mineralization of low concentration toluene (C7H8) is one of the most significant but challenging reactions in photocatalysis. It is generally assumed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) as the main reactive species contribute to the enhanced photoactivity, however, it remains ambiguous at this stage. Herein, a S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction with AlOOH as water resistant surface layer is in situ designed for tuning the free radical species and achieving deep mineralization of C7H8. By employing a combination of in situ DRIFTS and materials characterization techniques, we discover that&#160;the dominant intermediates such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid instead of toxic phenols are formed under the action of holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;). These dominant intermediates turn out to greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier. This study offers new possibilities for rationally tailoring the active species and thus directionally producing dominant intermediates via designing water resistant surface layer.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Templated Fabrication of Ultrathin Electroactive Gold Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale (width of ~20&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (0.49&#8197;nm) amorphous Au nanosheets are synthesized at room temperature in an aqueous solution using DNA nanosheets with extended single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a larger spacing (16.7&#8197;nm) for the first time. The extended ssDNA induces metallization and enables further precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions.







Abstract
Generally, two&#8208;dimensional gold nanomaterials have unique properties and functions that offer exciting application prospects. However, the crystal phases of these materials tend to be limited to the thermodynamically stable crystal structure. Herein, we report a DNA framework&#8208;templated approach for the ambient aqueous synthesis of freestanding and microscale amorphous gold nanosheets with ultrathin sub&#8208;nanometer thickness. We observe that extended single&#8208;stranded DNA on DNA nanosheets can induce site&#8208;specific metallization and enable precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions. More importantly, the as&#8208;prepared gold nanosheets can serve as an electrocatalyst for glucose oxidase&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic activity (~3&#8208;fold) relative to discrete gold nanoclusters owing to a larger electrochemical active area and wider band gap. The proposed DNA framework&#8208;templated metallization strategy is expected to be applicable in a broad range of fields, from catalysis to new energy materials.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2 Generation: Controlled and Optimized Dispersion of Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts Based on Pt&#8208;TCPP Planar Adsorption on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially controlled TiO2 surface decoration with Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) active sites is achieved by self&#8208;organized planar adsorption of mixed TCPP/Pt&#8208;TCPP precursor compounds. Via a suitable thermal treatment, an optimal loading and distribution of SA co&#8208;catalytic sites are established, which is a key factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
When using single atoms (SAs) as a co&#8208;catalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation, achieving a well&#8208;dispersed, evenly distributed and adjustable SA surface density on a semiconductor surface is a challenging task. In the present work we use the planar adsorption of tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TCPP) and its platinum coordinated analogue, Pt&#8208;TCPP, onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to establish a spatially controlled decoration of SAs. We show that the surface Pt SA density can be very well controlled by co&#8208;adsorption of Pt&#8208;TCPP and TCPP in the planar monolayer regime, and by adjusting the Pt&#8208;TCPP to TCPP ratio a desired well dispersed surface density of SAs up to 2.6&#215;105&#8197;atoms&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2 can be established (which is the most effective Pt SA loading for photocatalysis). This distribution and the SA state are maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.

         <title>LiNO3&#8208;Based Electrolytes via Electron&#8208;Donation Modulation for Sustainable Nonaqueous Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron donation modulation rules are proposed to elucidate the formation mechanism and stability principle of LiNO3 as the single salt for electrolytes of nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. High donor&#8208;number solvents with strong electron&#8208;donation ability dissolve LiNO3 while low donor&#8208;number solvents with weak electron&#8208;donation ability regulate the AI&#8208;ISC structure to stabilize the electrolyte. The LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte enables remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance by improving the solvent reduction tolerance.







Abstract
LiPF6 as a dominant lithium salt of electrolyte is widely used in commercial rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its well&#8208;balanced properties, including high solubility in organic solvents, good electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, it suffers from several undesirable properties, such as high moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and high cost. To address these issues, herein, we propose an electron&#8208;donation modulation (EDM) rule for the development of low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and electrochemically compatible LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes. We employ high donor&#8208;number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron&#8208;donation ability to dissolve LiNO3, while low donor&#8208;number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron&#8208;donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200&#8197;cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Tip&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Induced Surface Microenvironments Regulation Boosts the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;like FeN4 structures on curved carbon surfaces are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The curved structure induced a strong local electric field and dense interfacial water layer, enhancing the kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. The modulated electronic structures of Fe centers facilitate the ORR pathway transition from an associative to a dissociative process.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts with defined local structures and favorable surface microenvironments are significant for overcoming slow kinetics and accelerating O2 electroreduction. Here, enriched tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites (T&#8722;Fe SAC) on spherical carbon surfaces were developed to investigate the change in surface microenvironments and catalysis behavior. Finite element method (FEM) simulations, together with experiments, indicate the strong local electric field of the tip&#8208;like FeN4 and the more denser interfacial water layer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate the pathway transition on the tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites, promoting the dissociation of O&#8722;O bond via side&#8208;on adsorption model. The adsorbed OH* can be facilely released on the curved surface and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. The obtained T&#8722;Fe SAC nanoreactor exhibits excellent ORR activities (E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability, exceeding those of flat FeN4 and Pt/C. This work clarified the in&#8208;depth insights into the origin of catalytic activity of tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites and held great promise in industrial catalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and many other fields.

         <title>Tuning Shortwave&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;aggregates of Aromatic Ring&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs by Peripheral Substituents for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies at Ultralow Laser Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic ring [b]&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPYs are modified with multiple methoxyl groups to regulate the molecular surface electrostatic potential which successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregates. Importantly, BDP&#8208;a exhibits controllable J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation behaviors with adjustable morphologies. Its self&#8208;assembled J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles could be used for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapies under ultralow laser power density.







Abstract
Achieving photothermal therapy (PTT) at ultralow laser power density is crucial for minimizing photo&#8208;damage and allowing for higher maximum permissible skin exposure. However, this requires photothermal agents to possess not just superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), but also exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptivity. J&#8208;aggregates, exhibit a significant redshift and narrower absorption peak with a higher extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, achieving predictable J&#8208;aggregates through molecular design remains a challenge. In this study, we successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregation (&#955;absmax: 968&#8197;nm, &#1013;: 2.96&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#955;emmax: 972&#8197;nm, &#934;FL: 6.2&#8201;%) by tuning electrostatic interactions between &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular planes through manipulating molecular surface electrostatic potential of aromatic ring&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. Notably, by controlling the preparation method for encapsulating dyes into F&#8208;127 polymer, we were able to selectively generate H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, the J&#8208;aggregates exhibited two controllable morphologies: nanospheres and nanowires. Importantly, the shortwave&#8208;infrared J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles with impressive PCE of 72.9&#8201;% effectively destroyed cancer cells and mice&#8208;tumors at an ultralow power density of 0.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (915&#8197;nm). This phototherapeutic nano&#8208;platform, which generates predictable J&#8208;aggregation behavior, and can controllably form J&#8208;/H&#8208;aggregates and selectable J&#8208;aggregate morphology, is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor&#8208;treatment at ultralow laser power density.

     alt="Tuning Shortwave-Infrared J-aggregates of Aromatic Ring-Fused Aza-BODIPYs by Peripheral Substituents for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies at Ultralow Laser Power"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aromatic ring [&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]-fused aza-BODIPYs are modified with multiple methoxyl groups to regulate the molecular surface electrostatic potential which successfully induced desirable &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;aggregates. Importantly, &lt;b&gt;BDP-a&lt;/b&gt; exhibits controllable &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;H-&lt;/i&gt;aggregation behaviors with adjustable morphologies. Its self-assembled &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;aggregated nanoparticles could be used for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapies under ultralow laser power density.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving photothermal therapy (PTT) at ultralow laser power density is crucial for minimizing photo-damage and allowing for higher maximum permissible skin exposure. However, this requires photothermal agents to possess not just superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), but also exceptional near-infrared (NIR) absorptivity. &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregates, exhibit a significant redshift and narrower absorption peak with a higher extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, achieving predictable &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregates through molecular design remains a challenge. In this study, we successfully induced desirable &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;aggregation (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;max&lt;/sup&gt;: 968&#8197;nm, &#1013;: 2.96&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#955;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;max&lt;/sup&gt;: 972&#8197;nm, &#934;&lt;sub&gt;FL&lt;/sub&gt;: 6.2&#8201;%) by tuning electrostatic interactions between &#960;-conjugated molecular planes through manipulating molecular surface electrostatic potential of aromatic ring-fused aza-BODIPY dyes. Notably, by controlling the preparation method for encapsulating dyes into F-127 polymer, we were able to selectively generate &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, the &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregates exhibited two controllable morphologies: nanospheres and nanowires. Importantly, the shortwave-infrared &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregated nanoparticles with impressive PCE of 72.9&#8201;% effectively destroyed cancer cells and mice-tumors at an ultralow power density of 0.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (915&#8197;nm). This phototherapeutic nano-platform, which generates predictable &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;aggregation behavior, and can controllably form &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;H-&lt;/i&gt;aggregates and selectable &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;aggregate morphology, is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor-treatment at ultralow laser power density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500 Wh/kg</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 mA g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170 mAh g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500 Wh kg&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Supporting Information A Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Artificial Chloride&#8208;Selective Channel Constructed from 5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite considerable emphasis on advancing artificial ion channels, progress is constrained by the limited availability of small molecules with the necessary attributes of self&#8208;assembly and ion selectivity. In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5&#8208;haloisophthalamide and a non&#8208;halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted 5&#8208;iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport&#8208;mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self&#8208;assembly of molecules, forming a zig&#8208;zag channel pore that is well&#8208;suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels. A molecular dynamics simulation study, relying on the self&#8208;assembled component derived from the crystal structure, affirmed the paramount significance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the formation of supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette structures that span the bilayer.&#160; Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transport of chloride across the lipid bilayer membrane is facilitated by the synergistic effects of halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding within the channel.</dc:description>
