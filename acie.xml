         <title>Silicon Catalyzed C&#8208;O Bond Ring Closing Metathesis of Polyethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane catalyzes C&#8208;O bond metathesis of alkyl ethers with an efficiency outperforming all earlier reported systems. Chemoselective ring contractions of macrocyclic crown ethers enable substrate&#8208;specific transformations, and an unprecedented ring&#8208;closing metathesis of polyethylene glycols allows polymer&#8208;selective degradation. Quantum chemical computations scrutinize a high Lewis acidity paired with a simultaneous low propensity for polydentate substrate binding as critical for successful catalysis. Based on these mechanistic insights, a second&#8208;generation class of silicon Lewis superacid with enhanced efficacy is identified and demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Electrosynthesis of Formamide through C&#8211;N Coupling at the Industrially Relevant Current Density of 120 mA cm&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The   scalable and durable   e   lectrosynthesis   of   high&#8208;valued organonitrogen compounds from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules   ,   especially operating  at a high current density  , is highly desirable.   Here,   a one&#8208;pot electrooxidation method to synthesize formamide (HCONH  2  ) from methanol and ammonia over a commercial   b   oron&#8208;   d   oped   d   iamond (BDD) catalyst is reported. The formamide selectivity from methanol and formamide Faradaic efficiency (FE  HCONH2  ) achieve  73.2% and 41.2% at the current density  of 120 mA cm  &#8208;2  with high durability. The C  &#8208;  N bond originates from the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on an aldehyde&#8208;like intermediate. Impressively, an 8 L electrolyzer is employed for the pilot plant test over a 2200 cm  2  BDD electrode, which exhibits  33.5% FE  HCONH2  at  120 mA cm  &#8208;2  (current: 264 A  ) with a yield rate of  36.9 g h  &#8208;1  ,  demonstrating the potential of this technique for large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Chiral Carbene&#8208;Cu(I)&#8208;Amide Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical&#8208;active materials have been bursting into bloom in recent years, while chiroptical&#8208;active CMA complexes has not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral Cu(I)&#8208;based CMA enantiomers,  (R,R)&#8208;  PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC  and  (S,S)  &#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC  , were developed by using chiral phenyl&#8208;substituted  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The Cu(I)&#8208;based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, first reported in CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand&#8208;ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these Cu(I) enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from perspective of aggregation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Solid Superprotonic Supramolecular Polymer Electrolytes Based on Deep Eutectic Solvents and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) exhibit intriguing benefits in functional soft materials due to their dynamic bonding feature. However, most SPs can only exist in the solution state and fail to form bulk materials, which limits their applications. Here, we report the fabrication of semi&#8208;solid bulk SP materials by using polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify a deep eutectic solvent (DES). The abundant protons and strong hydrogen bonds afforded by POMs enable these SP materials as superprotonic conductive electrolytes with sufficient mechanical strength, showing a proton conductivity more than 1&#215;10  &#8208;4  &#160;S cm  &#8208;1&#160;  and a breaking strength exceeding 1 MPa at room temperature. Moreover, the thermodynamic reversibility of the SP electrolytes allows them to form a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by a facile melt&#8208;infiltration strategy upon mild heating, which leads to improved performance in supercapacitors. This work presents an innovative DES/POM hybrid system as a promising platform to develop functional supramolecular materials for energy and electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Well&#8208;defined Bimetallic 2D Polymers with Single Layer Thickness for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Innovative bimetallic materials provide more possibilities for further improving the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influencing factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hinders in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19 s  &#8722;1  was achieved at the overpotential of 500 mV.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proton Conductive Porous Framework of an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6&#8208;Ether&#160;Derivative Networked by Rigid Hydrogen Bonding Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a&#160;  C  3  &#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid with a hydrophilic18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) component. Despite the flexible macrocyclic structure with many conformations, the derivative with three dicarboxy&#8208;  o  &#8208;terphenyl moieties in the periphery yielded a rigid layered porous framework through directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, the HOF possesses 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The wet HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10  &#8211;7  S cm  &#8211;1  ) through Grotthuss mechanism (  E  a  = 0.27 eV) under 98%RH. The present unique water channel structure provides an inspiration to create molecular porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;N Bisindole Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;N Atropisomers are a common motif in natural products and represent a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, catalytic atroposelective synthesis of such molecules remains challenging, hampering meaningful development. In particular, enantioselective synthesis of N&#8208;N bisindole atropisomers is unprecedented. Herein, the first enantioselective synthesis of N&#8208;N bisindole atropisomers via palladium&#8208;catalyzed de novo construction of chiral indoles is presented. A wide variety of N&#8208;N axially chiral bisindoles were generated in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities via a cascade condensation/N&#8208;arylation reaction. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole, and nonbiaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8208;N axis were accessed using this protocol. Moreover, investigations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the reaction mechanism and enantioselective control.</dc:description>

         <title>Ag22 Nanoclusters with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Protected by Ag/Cyanurate/Phosphine Metallamacrocyclic Monolayers through In&#8208;Situ Ligand Transesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The composition of protection monolayer exerts great influence on the molecular and electronic structures of atomically precise monolayer protected metal nanoclusters. Four isostructural Ag/cyanurate/phosphine metallamacrocyclic monolayer protected Ag  22  nanoclusters are synthesized by kinetically controlled  in&#8208;situ  ligand formation&#8208;driven strategy. These eight&#8208;electron superatomic silver nanoclusters feature an unprecedented interfacial bonding structure with diverse E&#8208;Ag (E = O/N/P/Ag) interactions between the Ag  13  core and metallamacrocyclic monolayer, and displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), benefiting from their distinct donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structures. This work not only unmasks a new core&#8208;shell interface involving cyanurate ligand but also underlines the significance of high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity N&#8208;heterocyclic ligand in synthesizing TADF metal nanoclusters. This is the first mixed valence Ag(0/I) nanocluster with TADF characteristic.</dc:description>

         <title>Dramatically Enhanced Reactivity of Fullerenes and Tetrazine towards Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction inside a Porous Porphyrinic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (IEDDA) between fullerenes and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine generally requires harsh conditions and long reaction times due to their strong electron&#8208;accepting nature. Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of the fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions by installing a tetrazine&#8208;based axle (LA) via metal&#8208;ligand coordination bond, which modulates the cavity size to facilitate the encapsulation of fullerenes. Upon encapsulation, the close proximity of fullerenes and the tetrazine group of LA dramatically increase their reactivity towards the IEDDA reaction to form fullerene&#8208;tetrazine adducts. Furthermore, the C60&#8208;tetrazine adduct is rearranged upon hydration to a bent&#8208;shaped C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct that can be released from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity in the presence of excess LA, thus catalyzing the formation of C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct inside Zn&#8208;PB without product inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208; and Selenol&#8208;Assisted Delivery of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylthioamides have been frequently employed to assess the chemical biology and pharmacology of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). From this class of donors, however, extremely low H2S releasing efficiencies have been reported and proper mechanistic studies have been omitted. Consequently, millimolar concentrations of arylthioamides are required to liberate just trace amounts of H2S, and via an unidentified mechanistic pathway, which obfuscates the interpretation of any biological activity that stems from their use. Herein, we report that H2S release from this valuable class of donors can be markedly enhanced through intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. Specifically, we demonstrate that both disulfide&#8208; and diselenide&#8208;linked thioamides are responsive to biologically relevant concentrations of glutathione and release two molar equivalents of H2S via an intramolecular cyclization that significantly augments their rate and efficiency of sulfide delivery in both buffer and live human cells.</dc:description>

         <title>The Linkage of Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Unactivated Alkenes via Hydrosulfonimidoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S ulfur(VI) fluoride cleavage and exchanging linkage, a new generation of linkage chemistry, exhibits enormous potential for combining a range of functional molecules in an increasing number of fields. Herein, we established a metal&#8208;free linkage of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minute s. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step, and it occurs via overlap of the LUMO in the sulfonimidoyl cation and HOMO in the unactivated alkene, which was confirmed via control experiments with deuterated compounds . DFT calculations further demonstrated the concerted process involving formation of the S&#8208;C(  sp  3  ) bond and hydride transfer . Remarkably, abundant natural products and pharmaceuticals with multiple heteroatoms and sensitive functional groups have been subjected to the current linkage reaction to achieve various sulfoximine linkages, furnishing the basis for drug discovery and drug conjugation .</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Allylic C&#8208;H Amination of Vinylsilanes and Vinylboronates using Silicon or Boron as a Regioselectivity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylsilanes and vinylboronates are common building blocks for organic synthesis, but direct functionalization of these species without the participation of either the C=C or C&#8208;Si/B bonds is rare. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8208;H amination reaction of these vinylmetalloid species that installs a new C&#8208;N bond without competing transmetallation or alkene addition. In this transformation, the silicon or boron substituent inverts the usual regioselectivity, directing amination to the site distal to that group. Subsequent cross&#8208;coupling or demetallation allows access to complementary regioisomeric products. Density Functional Theory computations revealed that the observed regioselectivity is due to a subtle combination of electronic and counterintuitive steric factors that favor initial attack of selenium at the silicon&#8208;bearing carbon atom.</dc:description>

Density Functional Theory computations revealed that the observed regioselectivity is due to a subtle combination of electronic and counterintuitive steric factors that favor initial attack of selenium at the silicon-bearing carbon atom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Best&#8208;Practice DFT Protocols for Basic Molecular Computational Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. Most of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations apply various combinations of DFT&#8208;based methods. This Scientific Perspective provides best&#8208;practice protocols and guidance in the choice of robust method combinations to deal with many day&#8208;to&#8208;day challenges in computational chemistry and discusses representative examples.







Abstract
Nowadays, many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. The lion's share of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations applies density functional theory (DFT) evaluated in atomic&#8208;orbital basis sets. This work provides best&#8208;practice guidance on the numerous methodological and technical aspects of DFT calculations in three parts: Firstly, we set the stage and introduce a step&#8208;by&#8208;step decision tree to choose a computational protocol that models the experiment as closely as possible. Secondly, we present a recommendation matrix to guide the choice of functional and basis set depending on the task at hand. A particular focus is on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency through multi&#8208;level approaches. Finally, we discuss selected representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and the effect of methodological choices.

         <title>Influence of Phase Transitions on Diffusive Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive transport of a hydrophobic cation, measured with nonlinear light scattering, across the membrane of liposomes composed of E. coli lipid extracts increases dramatically at membrane phase transition temperatures.







Abstract
Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug&#8208;releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time&#8208;resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#8201;&#176;C to 36&#8201;&#176;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid&#8208;disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#8201;&#176;C and 27.6&#8201;&#176;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the liquid&#8208;disordered phase at 36&#8201;&#176;C is 35&#8208;times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;s&#8722;1 of the gel phase at 9&#8201;&#176;C. For the mixed&#8208;phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid&#8208;disordered bulk.

         <dc:description>Molecular materials possessing photo&#8208;tunable polarization switching&#160;is promising&#160;for optical switches, smart sensors, and data storage devices. However, it is challenging to devise a molecular material featuring simultaneous switchable magnetic and dielectric properties with regard to non&#8208;invasive and convenient light stimulus.

Photo&#8208;monitored structural analyses revealed that it was the photo&#8208;induced deformation of FeII&#160;coordination sphere and relative movement of guest anthracene that resulted in the variation of the local electric dipoles. These findings provide a new strategy to realize polarization switching through the light&#8208;induced spin crossover, and would be of fundamental significance for future photo&#8208;switchable and multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Chiro&#8208;Inositol Organosilicon Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilicons have been used extensively in aerospace, electronics, food, medicine and other fields, due to their low viscosity, hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance, non&#8208;toxic, and physiologically inert features. Despite extensive interest, however, organosilicon ferroelectric crystals have never been found. Here, by using the chemical design strategy, we successfully obtained a molecular ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 with polar P43 symmetry, whose spontaneous polarization can be electrically switchable on thin film. The introduction of organosilicon groups endows the thin films with excellent softness, ductility and flexibility (extremely low hardness of 72.8 MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04 GPa) that are desirable for biomedical and human&#8208;compatible applications. As the first case of organosilicon ferroelectric crystal to date, this work offers a new structural paradigm for molecular ferroelectrics, and highlights their potential for flexible bio&#8208;electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Intranuclear Nanoribbons for Selective Killing of Osteosarcoma Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we show intranuclear nanoribbons formed upon dephosphorylation of leucine&#8208;rich L&#8208; or D&#8208;phosphopentapeptide catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to selectively kill osteosarcoma cells. Being dephosphorylated by ALP, the peptides firstly transformed into micelles and then convert into nanoribbons. The peptides/assemblies firstly aggregate on cell membrane, then enter cells via endocytosis, and finally accumulate in nuclei (mainly in nucleoli). Proteomics analysis suggests that the assemblies interact with histone proteins. The peptides kill osteosarcoma cells rapidly, and are nontoxic to normal cells. Moreover, the repeated stimulation of the osteosarcoma cells by the peptides sensitizes the cancer cells rather than inducing resistance. This work not only illustrates a novel mechanism for nucleus&#8208;targeting, but also may lead a new way to selectively kill osteosarcoma cells and overcome drug resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Rise and Decay Dynamics of Upconversion Luminescence through Controlling Excitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from organic dye/quantum dot possessing one luminescent center, upconversion luminescence (UCL) is actually a temporal statistic of countless individual activators. Our experimental results have shown that the rise and decay dynamics of UCL is directly associated with the relative contribution of sensitizer&#8208;to&#8208;activator energy transfer and energy migration among sensitizers, which can be physically modulated by tuning the excitation laser. Therefore, dynamic UCL with record&#8208;wide 20&#8208;fold lifetime, ~70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, and reversibly definable emission color is easily realized by just modulating the excitation laser. Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest&#8208;possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core&#8208;shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.</dc:description>

Therefore, dynamic UCL with record-wide 20-fold lifetime, ~70-fold red-to-green intensity ratio, and reversibly definable emission color is easily realized by just modulating the excitation laser. Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest-possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core-shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origins of p&#8208;Doping and Nonradiative Recombination in CsSnI3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is commonly believed that the spontaneous p&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites is caused by Sn vacancies. By performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations for a prototypical Sn&#8208;based perovskite CsSnI3, we reveal that, in fact, the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies. The reason that adding extra Sn2+  could reduce p&#8208;doping is that Cs and Sn present the same changing trend in terms of chemical potentials, and thus inhibiting the formation of Sn vacancies will also limit the formation of Cs vacancies. Moreover, we show that I vacancies are the dominant nonradiative recombination centers, and can result in sizable nonradiative losses, which explains why the experimentally measured carrier lifetime is only a few nanoseconds even if p&#8208;doping is suppressed. This work provides new insights into the origins of p&#8208;doping and nonradiative recombination in CsSnI3, and suggests that minimizing the formation of Cs and I vacancies is critical to realizing the best device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically controlled thermochromic switching for multi&#8208;input molecular logic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leuco dye&#8208;based thermochromic materials offer enormous potential for visible molecular logic due to the appealing reversible color&#8208;changing effect. The stable color state is uncontrollable as it depends only on the spontaneous protonation of the leuco dye and color developer. There is still a challenge to propose an effective approach to control bistable color function at required temperature. A family of azobenzenes with various alkyl chains (AZO(n)) is designed for protonation competition with leuco dye.&#160;The hydrogen bond and Van der Waals forces are formed between color developer and AZO(n). The color developer can be locked to provide the proton for the leuco dye by Z&#8208;AZO(n), while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. The locked state can be lasted for more than 16 hours. This optically controlled leuco dye&#8208;based system demonstrates a visible sequential logic operation with four&#8208;input signals, and provides a new type of protonation&#8208;based optical control.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Structural Motif in Lanthipeptide Synthetases for Substrate Binding and Interdomain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Class III lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze the formation of lanthionine/methyllanthionine and labionin crosslinks. We present here the 2.40 &#197; resolution structure of the kinase domain of a class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC from the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. A unique structural subunit for leader binding, named leader recognition domain (LRD), was identified. The LRD of CurKC is responsible for the recognition of the leader peptide and for mediating interactions between the lyase and kinase domains. LRDs are highly conserved among the kinase domains of class III and class IV lanthipeptide synthetases. The discovery of LRDs provides insights into the substrate recognition and domain organization in multi&#8208;domain lanthipeptide synthetases.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Areal Density Single&#8208;Atoms/Metal Oxide Nanosheets: A Micro&#8208;Gas Blasting Synthesis and Superior Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets are conducive to not only endow opened surfaces for loading active metal atoms but also boost the mass transfer for the heterogeneous reactions. The challenge is how to load and stabilize single&#8208;atoms on nanosheets in high&#8208;areal densities. This work reports an efficient micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) strategy to access versatile noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Ir  1  /CoO  x  , Pd  1  /CeO  2  ,  etc  . Especially for Pt/CeO  2  nanosheets (Pt  1  /CeO  2  &#8208;S), the Pt loading is increased to 15 at%. The Pt  1  /CeO  2  &#8208;S catalysts from MGB are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance in the model reaction of water&#8208;gas shift (WGS). The Pt  1  /CeO  2  &#8208;S catalyst exhibit 2&#8208;3 times reactivity that of their thicker counterpart, single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /CeO  2  microspheric catalyst. Moreover, the single&#8208;atom sites in Pt  1  /CeO  2  &#8208;S (1&#8208;10%) catalysts are stable in a harsh WGS reaction condition of 10 % CO. This work thus paves a way to access the practical single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to Methanol: The Renaissance of Low&#8208;Temperature Catalysis in the Context of the Methanol Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of renewable methanol using recycled CO2 and green H2 is a long&#8208;term solution to address the carbon conundrum and achieve a sustainable economy. This Review reflects on the key developments in low&#8208;temperature methanol synthesis from CO2 and CO using homogeneous catalysts. The integration of direct air capture of CO2 and its conversion to methanol as a promising avenue in &#8220;air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel&#8221; technologies is also highlighted.







Abstract
The traditional economy based on carbon&#8208;intensive fuels and materials has led to an exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 levels increased by 50&#8201;% since the pre&#8208;industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed methanol economy pioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO2 to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction, homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO2, CO and their derivatives as potential low&#8208;temperature alternatives to the commercial processes. This Review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.

         <title>[8]Cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine as A Super&#8208;Cyclooctatetraene: Dynamic Behavior, Global Aromaticity, and Open&#8208;Shell Diradical Character in The Neutral and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;cyclooctatetraene, one new core&#8208;expanded analogue of cyclooctatetraene, has been synthesized by insertion of a benzenoid/quinoid C6H4 unit into each C&#8722;C bond. The neutral molecule shows three dynamic processes on the NMR time scale and non&#8208;aromatic character, whereas its dication exhibits enhanced planarity, global aromatic, and open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
An [8]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes) was synthesized. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a tub&#8208;shaped geometry similar to the cyclooctatetraene, with alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclosed a slow valence tautomerization process with an interconversion energy barrier of about 11.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at coalescence temperature (273&#8197;K), and two more lower&#8208;barrier dynamic processes involving flipping of the 1,4&#8208;phenyl rings on the backbone and rotation of the mesityl substituents.

     alt="[8]Cyclo-para-phenylmethine as A Super-Cyclooctatetraene: Dynamic Behavior, Global Aromaticity, and Open-Shell Diradical Character in The Neutral and Dicationic States"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A super-cyclooctatetraene, one new core-expanded analogue of cyclooctatetraene, has been synthesized by insertion of a benzenoid/quinoid C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit into each C&#8722;C bond. The neutral molecule shows three dynamic processes on the NMR time scale and non-aromatic character, whereas its dication exhibits enhanced planarity, global aromatic, and open-shell diradical character.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An [8]cyclo-&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylmethine derivative (&lt;b&gt;[8]CPPM-Mes&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized. X-ray analysis revealed a tub-shaped geometry similar to the cyclooctatetraene, with alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure. Variable-temperature NMR measurements disclosed a slow valence tautomerization process with an interconversion energy barrier of about 11.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at coalescence temperature (273&#8197;K), and two more lower-barrier dynamic processes involving flipping of the 1,4-phenyl rings on the backbone and rotation of the mesityl substituents. Its dication (&lt;b&gt;[8]CPPM-Mes&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) adopts a bowl-like geometry with a smaller depth of the cavity, and a slow bowl inversion process was observed by dynamic NMR. The bond lengths of the benzenoid/quinoid rings are more averaged via electron delocalization and the molecule shows global aromaticity, which was further validated by NMR and theoretical analysis. &lt;b&gt;[8]CPPM-Mes&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits open-shell diradical character with a small singlet-triplet energy gap (&#8722;1.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Woven nodes, serving as dynamic crosslinks, afford a woven polymer network (WPN). The WPN exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of covalent polymer network (CPN), but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity, self&#8208;healing, and reprocessability, resembling to those of supramolecular polymer network (SPN).







Abstract
Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multifunctional enzyme is reported that can promote biocatalytic cascades based on multiple stereoselective steps. Specifically, a 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme can form enamine and iminium ion intermediates from aldehydes and enals to promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamines and iminium ions and combine their mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.

         <title>High&#8208;Humidity Shaker Aging to Access Chitin and Cellulose Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance. It relies on a new mechanochemical method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA), involving mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate.







Abstract
To unlock nature's potential for functional biomaterials, many efforts have been devoted to isolating the nanocrystalline domains within the supramolecular structure of polysaccharides. Yet, low reactivity and yield in aqueous systems along with excessive solvent usage hinders its development. In this report, the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance is described, relying on a new method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA). The method involves a mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate. Insights into the mechanism were uncovered, which highlighted the unique role of high humidity to afford a gradual uptake of water by the material up to deliquescence when the reaction is complete. This process was then validated for direct synthesis of nanocrystals from biomass sources including crab and soft wood pulp.

The inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers was investigated. Bridged bicyclic lactones were obtained diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively and converted into synthetically relevant polysubstituted enantioenriched cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene derivatives. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards a stepwise mechanism.







Abstract
A broadly applicable diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers is reported herein. Using a copper(II)&#8208;BOX catalytic system, bridged bicyclic lactones are obtained in very high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers. Mechanistic experiments as well as DFT calculations indicate the occurrence of a stepwise mechanism. The synthetic potential of the bridged bicyclic lactones is showcased by the enantioselective synthesis of polyfunctional cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes, as well as a carbasugar unit.

         <title>Luminescence Lifetime Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight related luminescence mechanisms, selected techniques of luminescence lifetime imaging based on lanthanide nanoparticles, and their advanced applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data storage, bio&#8208;multiplexing, and biosensing.







Abstract
Luminescence lifetime imaging has exhibited significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification detection because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetimes. Recently, great emphasis has been put on the exploration of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long&#8208;lived luminescence. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter out background signals during imaging, but also provides a wide range of tunable lifetime. Here, we introduce the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs, the key strategies for luminescence lifetime modulation, data acquisition methods, and several cutting&#8208;edge applications in lifetime imaging systems. Then we describe several prospects to inspire efforts for improving technologies and extending applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luminescence lifetime imaging has exhibited significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification detection because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetimes. Recently, great emphasis has been put on the exploration of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long-lived luminescence. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter out background signals during imaging, but also provides a wide range of tunable lifetime. Here, we introduce the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs, the key strategies for luminescence lifetime modulation, data acquisition methods, and several cutting-edge applications in lifetime imaging systems. Then we describe several prospects to inspire efforts for improving technologies and extending applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of Organic Acids and Carbonyl Compounds in n&#8208;Butane Oxidation via &#947;&#8208;Ketohydroperoxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry in conjunction with single photon tunable synchrotron radiation provides clear experimental evidence of organic acids and carbonyl formation from &#947;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide decomposition via the Korcek mechanism. These results provide experimental and computational bounds that enable the construction of more realistic and accurate chemical kinetic mechanisms for autoignition chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial chain&#8208;branching step in autoignition is the decomposition of ketohydroperoxides (KHP) to form an oxy radical and OH. Other pathways compete with chain&#8208;branching, such as &#8220;Korcek&#8221; dissociation of &#947;&#8208;KHP to a carbonyl and an acid. Here we characterize the formation of a &#947;&#8208;KHP and its decomposition to formic acid+acetone products from observations of n&#8208;butane oxidation in two complementary experiments. In jet&#8208;stirred reactor measurements, KHP is observed above 590&#8197;K. The KHP concentration decreases with increasing temperature, whereas formic acid and acetone products increase. Observation of characteristic isotopologs acetone&#8208;d3 and formic acid&#8208;d0 in the oxidation of CH3CD2CD2CH3 is consistent with a Korcek mechanism. In laser&#8208;initiated oxidation experiments of n&#8208;butane, formic acid and acetone are produced on the timescale of KHP removal. Modelling the time&#8208;resolved production of formic acid provides an estimated upper limit of 2&#8197;s&#8722;1 for the rate coefficient of KHP decomposition to formic acid+acetone.

         <title>A Thioether&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allyl Halides and Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling of allyl bromides and arylboronic acids was developed using a designer thioether catalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of a key sulfoxonium ylide that binds to the arylboronic acid and triggers 1,2&#8208;aryl migration.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis. In these reactions transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Herein, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid. The cross&#8208;coupling event occurred readily under mild condition in the presence of a weak inorganic base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a sulfonium ylide mechanism.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Doping Effect on Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Ligated Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of single and multiple gold atom doping on optical properties of silver nanoclusters was analysed in linear and nonlinear regime experimentally and with TD&#8208;DFT simulations. Ag24Au1 nanocluster is a robust emitter, with strongly enhanced luminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness with respect to Ag25 parent nanocluster.







Abstract
Noble metal nanoclusters allow for the atomically&#8208;precise control of their composition. However, to create nanoclusters with pre&#8208;defined optical properties, comprehensive description of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations (TD&#8208;DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag25&#8722;xAux(DMBT)18 nanoclusters where x=0, 1 and 5&#8211;10. For Ag24Au1(DMBT)18 we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non&#8208;linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically&#8208;precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incredibly strong C&#8722;X bonds such as those in aryl fluorides are catalytically cleaved using an anionic Rh&#8722;Ga photoredox catalyst. Excitation of the bimetallic complex with violet light generates a potent photoreductant that is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer to even electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides that ultimately results in substrate hydrodefluorination.







Abstract
An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoromethylarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H2, a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh0 intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H2 and base as the terminal reductant.

         <title>Polycyclic Hydrocarbons from [4n]Annulenes: Correlation versus Hybridization Forces in the Formation of Diradicaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptual electronic structure trip from [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromatics to diradicaloids and to more hierarchical complex molecular shapes made by internal covalent hybridization of the peripheral [4n] &#960;&#8208;electron circuit is described. Focus is on the underlying physical organic chemistry implications.







Abstract
The conceptual connections between [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, disjoint orbitals, correlation energy, pro&#8208;aromaticity and diradical character for a variety of extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, including some salient recent examples of nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic radicals, are provided based on their [4n]annulene peripheries. The realization of such structure&#8211;property relationships has led to a beneficial pedagogic exercise establishing design guidelines for diradicaloids.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metal Clusters on 2D Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets have been synthesized by a universal sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy. The resultant catalyst shows unique chemical state and nanostructures, enabling a high catalytic activity, selectivity, poison tolerance and stability for the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
A sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy is presented for the synthesis of fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 (SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2) nanosheets. This synthesis features the introduction of the sulfhydryl group in monomicelles to finely realize the controllable co&#8208;assembly process of Pt precursors within ordered mesostructures. The resultant SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows uniform SAL Pt clusters (&#8776;1.2&#8197;nm) anchored in ultrathin 2D nanosheets (&#8776;7&#8197;nm) with a high surface area (139&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), a large pore size (&#8776;25&#8197;nm) and a high dispersion (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Moreover, this strategy is universal for the synthesis of other SAL metal clusters (Pd and Au) on 2D mTiO2 with high exposure and accessibility. When used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene, the SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows a high catalytic activity (TOF up to 2424&#8197;h&#8722;1), 100&#8201;% selectivity for 4&#8208;aminostyrene, good stability, and anti&#8208;resistance to thiourea poisoning under relatively mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 10&#8197;bar).

         <title>Oxy&#8208;Borylenes as Photoreductants: Synthesis and Application in Dehalogenation and Detosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a series of oxy&#8208;borylenes and their corresponding radical cations is reported. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for those highly reducing oxy&#8208;borylenes. Their ability as photoreductants is then showcased by the detosylation of tosylated anilines and the dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl as well as alkyl halides under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
While the range of accessible borylenes has significantly broadened over the last decade, applications remain limited. Herein, we present tricoordinate oxy&#8208;borylenes as potent photoreductants that can be readily activated by visible light. Facile oxidation of CAAC stabilized oxy&#8208;borylenes (CAAC)(IPr2Me2)BOR (R=TMS, CH2CH2C6H5, CH2CH2(4&#8208;F)C6H4) to their corresponding radical cations is achieved with mildly oxidizing ferrocenium ion. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for such oxy&#8208;borylenes placing them among the strongest organic super electron donors. Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.

         <title>Mechanistic Origin of Favorable Substituent Effects in Excellent Cu Cyclam Based HNO Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties and Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A computational study reproduced their various experimental reactivities and revealed subtle and sometimes unexpected interwoven effects of steric and electronic factors, which offer the first mechanistic understanding of substituent effects for excellent HNO sensors to facilitate future development.







Abstract
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties. Metal complexes and derivatives are widely used to make excellent HNO sensors. However, their favorable mechanistic origins are largely unknown. Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A quantum chemical study of Cu cyclams with various substitutions was performed, which reproduced diverse experimental reactivities. Structural, electronic, and energetic profiles along reaction pathways show the importance of HNO binding and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism for HNO reaction. Results reveal that steric effect is primary and electronic factor is secondary (if the redox potential is sufficient), but their interwoven effects can lead to unexpected reactivity, which looks mysterious experimentally but can be explained computationally. This work suggests rational substituent design ideas and recommends a theoretical study of a new design to save time and cost due to its subtle effect.

         <title>Selectively Coupling Ru Single Atoms to PtNi Concavities for High&#8208;Performance Methanol Oxidation via d&#8208;Band Center Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom&#8208;cavity coupling enables the superior activity and stability of Ru single atoms tailored PtNi nano&#8208;catalysts towards methanol oxidation, synthesized by the selective ALD. The modulated d&#8208;band center and higher diffusion barrier accounts for the unparallel activity and stability on the Ru single atoms coupled to PtNi cavities, respectively.







Abstract
Single atom tailored metal nanoparticles represent a new type of catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a single atom&#8208;cavity coupling strategy to regulate performance of single atom tailored nano&#8208;catalysts. Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) was conducted to deposit Ru single atoms on the surface concavities of PtNi nanoparticles (Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi). Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi exhibits a record&#8208;high activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with 2.01&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt. Also, Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi showcases a significant durability with only 16&#8201;% activity loss. Operando electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations demonstrate Ru single atoms coupled to cavities accelerate the CO removal by regulating d&#8208;band center position. Further, the high diffusion barrier of Ru single atoms in concavities accounts for excellent stability. The developed Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi via single atom&#8208;cavity coupling opens an encouraging pathway to design highly efficient single atom&#8208;based (electro)catalysts.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Trap Engineering toward Remarkable Crystallographic Reorientation and Efficient Cation Migration of Zn Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special design of anion&#8208;trap additive can greatly enhance the stability and capacity of the Zn ion batteries via modulating preferred Zn crystal plane and enabling fast Zn ion migration.







Abstract
Zn batteries are considered as potential candidates in future power sources, however suffer problems of rampant dendrite/by&#8208;product on Zn anodes, torpid Zn2+ transfer/diffusion and poor energy density. Inspired by the host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, an anion&#8208;trap agent &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4&#8722; is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevating the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;&#8208;CD@ClO4&#8722; complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth. Above combined functions lead to substantial enhancement in long&#8208;term stability and cell capacity, as proved by 10&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn symmetric cells and 57&#8201;% capacity increasement of Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) compared with that of pure Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seemingly simple yet surprisingly difficult to probe, excess protons in water constitute complex quantum objects with strong interactions with the extended and dynamically changing hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of the liquid. Proton hydration plays pivotal roles in energy transport in hydrogen fuel cells and signal transduction in transmembrane proteins. While geometries and stoichiometry have been widely addressed in both experiment and theory, the electronic structure of these specific hydrated proton complexes has remained elusive. Here we show, layer by layer, how utilizing novel flatjet technology for accurate x&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements and combining infrared spectral analysis and calculations, we find orbital&#8208;specific markers that distinguish two main electronic&#8208;structure effects: Local orbital interactions determine covalent bonding between the proton and neigbouring water molecules, while orbital&#8208;energy shifts measure the strength of the extended electric field of the proton.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at Cage Carboranes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the structures of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carborane derivatives&#160;bearing carbazole chromophores that emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL). By adjusting the substituent positions on the carborane derivatives, two chiral luminescent molecules, Cb1 and Cb2, with different properties were obtained. The photoluminescence dissymmetry factors |gPL| of both (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in neat films were as high as&#160;6.24 &#215; 10&#8208;3  and 7.38&#215;10&#8208;3, respectively. Cb1 showed a deep blue emission peak at 434 nm in  n&#8208;pentane. Interestingly, distinct fluorescence and CPL spectra were observed in solvents of different polarities due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect, suggesting its potential use in solvent recognition. Meanwhile, Cb2 exhibited good AIECL property, excellent ECL stability and could be used for determining dopamine concentrations, suggesting its potential applications in biology and diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Complexes Empowered by London Dispersion: The C&#8208;H Functionalization Nexus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterobimetallic [BiRh] tetracarboxylate catalysts endowed with 1,3&#8208;disilylated phenylglycine paddlewheels benefit from interligand London dispersion. They were originally designed for asymmetric cyclopropanation but are now shown to perform very well in asymmetric C&#8208;&#173;H functionalization reactions too. Because of the confined ligand sphere about the derived donor/acceptor carbenes, insertions into unhindered methyl groups are kinetically favored, although methylene units also react with excellent levels of asymmetric induction; even gaseous ethane is a suitable substrate. Moreover, many functional groups in both partners are tolerated. The resulting products are synthetically equivalent to the outcome of traditional asymmetric ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, propargylation and aldol reactions and therefore constitute a valuable nexus to more conventional chemical logic.</dc:description>

Although the progress is remarkable, it remains challenging to manipulate them in a controllable way for both tailored structures and specific active functions.

         <title>Exploring the Gas Phase Formation and Chemical Reactivity of Highly Reduced M8L6 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination cages with well&#8208;defined cavities show great promise in the field of catalysis on account of their unique combination of molecular confinement effects and transition metal redox chemistry. Here, three coordination cages are reduced from their native 16+ oxidation state to the 2+ state in the gas phase without observable structural degradation. Using this method, the reaction rate constants for each reduction step were determined, with no noticeable differences arising following either the incorporation of a C60&#8208;fullerene guest or alteration of the cage chemical structure. The reactivity of highly reduced cage species toward molecular oxygen is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; after a threshold number of reduction steps, which is influenced by guest molecules and the structure of cage components. These new experimental approaches provide a unique window to explore the chemistry of highly&#8208;reduced cage species that can be modulated by altering their structures and encapsulated guest species.</dc:description>

         <title>Microbial Fermentation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Plastic Waste for the Production of Chemicals or Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ideonella sakaiensis  (  I. sakaiensis  ) can grow on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the major carbon and energy source. Previous work has shown that PET conversion in the presence of oxygen released carbon dioxide and water while yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that  I. sakaiensis  is a facultative anaerobe that ferments PET to the feedstock chemicals acetate and ethanol in the absence of oxygen. In addition to PET, the pure monomer ethylene glycol (EG), the intermediate product ethanol, and the carbohydrate fermentation test substance maltose can also serve as fermenting substrates. Co&#8208;culturing of  I.&#160;sakaiensis  with the electrogenic and acetate&#8208;consuming  Geobacter sulfurreducens  produced electricity from PET or EG. This newly identified plastic fermentation process by  I.&#160;sakaiensis  pro&#8208;vides thus a novel biosynthetic route to produce high&#8208;value chemicals or electricity from plastic waste streams.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging category of organic polymers with highly porous crystalline structures. In the last decade, reports on the use of COFs as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations show very significant progress. Still, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of the photocatalytic organic transformations using COFs are lacking. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations. Firstly, we discussed the photophysical properties and the characterization methods of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Then, the general photocatalytic mechanism, the advantages, and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts are summarized. After that, advanced examples of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformation are analyzed with regard to the underlying mechanisms. The review ends with a critical perspective on the challenges and prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenyl Imide with Mono&#8208;, or Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition of allenyl imide and mono&#8208; or disubstituted alkenes is disclosed. The key feature of this method is the use of bidentate allenyl imide and weakly activated and less steric hindered alkene pair by utilizing chiral magnesium(II) complex of N,N'&#8208;dioxide, which could provide through&#8208;space dispersion interactions to orientate the arrangement of the alkene. This protocol allows the generation of a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes and four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing spirocycles (80 examples) in high yield (up to 99%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee), and the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active molecules as well. Experimental studies and DFT calculations revealed that this [2+2] cycloaddition proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving a short&#8208;lived zwitterionic intermediate. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the alkenes and the amide moiety in the ligand was crucial for the enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements have been increasingly studied in the past 5 years. Their emergence is taking materials science one step further because they exhibit superior properties to conventional NPs in a range of respects, including catalysis. This review focuses on the recent progress in multi&#8208;element NPs regarding synthesis, especially in regard to chemical synthesis, characterization, and properties. We begin with a brief introduction of the multi&#8208;element NPs and an overview of their synthesis methods. Then, we present representative examples of multi&#8208;element alloy NPs and ceramic NPs, including oxide NPs prepared by chemical syntheses. This review intends to provide useful insights into the chemical methods that are used to synthesize multi&#8208;element NPs, and includes a discussion on the possibilities arising from their use in new functional materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knoevenagel condensation is a powerful tool for the construction of vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we established a concise approach to vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation at the multi&#8208;methyl groups of a pyridine ring through in situ formation of  N  &#8208;acyl pyridinium cation in the presence of various acylating reagents. Following such a strategy, two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine and multi&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;substituted aromatic derivatives as monomers. The resultant COFs are highly crystalized into hexagonal lattices with specific surface areas as large as 1915 m  2  g  &#8208;1  (vs. 1972 m  2  g  &#8208;1  of theoretical value). The stable and abundant pyridine&#8208;decorated regular nanochannels within the COFs allow for catalyzing the esterification of several pharmaceutical intermediates with distinct spatially confined selectivity and recyclability, representing an environmentally friendly catalytic organic transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)/phosphine catalysis system enabled versatile meta&#8208;arene C&#8722;H glycosylation by &#963;&#8208;activation. Thus, easily accessible glycosyl bromide donors furnished 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;aryl glycosides via robust ruthenium(II) catalysis under exceedingly mild conditions.







Abstract
The prevalence of C&#8208;aryl glycosides in biologically active natural products and approved drugs has long motivated the development of efficient strategies for their selective synthesis. Cross&#8208;couplings have been frequently used, but largely relied on palladium catalyst with prefunctionalized substrates, while ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;aryl glycoside preparation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we disclose a versatile ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation to access meta&#8208;C&#8208;aryl glycosides from readily available glycosyl halide donors. The robustness of the ruthenium catalysis was reflected by mild reaction conditions, outstanding levels of anomeric selectivity and exclusive meta&#8208;site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Bi&#8208;polaron Transport and Magnetic Field Induced Pauli Spin Blockade in Redox&#8208;Active Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade in solid&#8208;state molecular junctions (MJs) evidenced by a positive magnetoresistance (MR). The junction was made of thin layers of redox&#8208;active ruthenium polypyridyl&#8208;oligomers Ru(tpy)  2  sandwiched between conducting amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) electrodes. The redox&#8208;active Ru(tpy)  2  molecule, which enables small polaron and deep traps in the charge transport of the Ru(tpy)  2  MJ as revealed by the temperature&#8208;dependent current&#8208;voltage response, leads to the formation of the bi&#8208;polaron and magnetic field induced Pauli spin blockade, resulting into the MR. At the meantime, the reliable and controllable device performance renders a rigid thickness&#8208;dependent MR evolution. The bi&#8208;polaron transport revealed in our study underscores the importance of the multi&#8208;particle transport by molecular design in MJs and laid the foundation for magnetic&#8208;electronic function in molecular&#8208;scale devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyridine&#8208;Stabilized N&#8208;Phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboravinyl Cation: Boron Analogue of Vinyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A boron analogue of vinyl cation, pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboravinyl cation 2+, was synthesized by displacement of bromide in diborene 1 with excess pyridine. Experimental and computational studies showed that the positive charge is mainly at the B&#8208;B skeleton with delocalization to the pyridine ligand. One of the main modes of reactivity is through the B=B double bond alongside activation of the pyridine substituent, where the Bpyridine center is the predominant nucleophilic center and the predominant electrophilic center is either the activated pyridine para position or the BNHC center, illustrating the presence of diborene cation A, borylene&#8208;borenium cation B and diborene&#8208;pyridinium cation C resonance structures in cation 2+.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Preparation of Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising in organic optoelectronic materials, and their properties largely depend on the size, edge, and conformation. Herein, the fully armchair&#8208;edged GNRs (AGNRs) with lengths up to 2.65 nm were conveniently synthesized from hexabutoxytriphenylene, where a Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling was disclosed and served as a key step. The resulting AGNRs (  2HBT  ,  3HBT  , and  4HBT  ) possess highly twisted &#960;&#8208;scaffolds, and the torsion angles between the adjacent triphenylene moieties are larger than 32  o  as proved by crystallographic analyses. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies manifest that butoxyls endow AGNRs with an electron&#8208;rich feature, the extension of the &#960;&#8208;system from  2HBT  to  4HBT  reinforces S  0  &#8594; S  1  excitation, and the distortion of &#960;&#8208;scaffold enhances fluorescence quantum yield (  &#1060;  F  ). Particularly,  4HBT  has the lowest oxidation potential (  E  ox  1  = 0.55 V  vs.  SCE) and displays red fluorescence with  &#1060;  F  of 81%.</dc:description>

         <title>From Inert to Catalytically Active Milling Media &#8211; Galvanostatic Coating for Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inert milling balls, commonly utilized in mechanochemical reactions, were coated with a layer of Pd and utilized as catalyst in the direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki reaction. With high yields (&gt;80%), the milling balls can be recycled multiple times in the absence of any solvents, ligands, catalyst&#8208;molecules and &#8208;powders, while utilizing as little as 0.8 mg of Pd per coated milling ball. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness were examined towards archiving high catalyst retention, low abrasion and high conversion. The approach was transferred to the coating of milling vessels revealing the interplay between catalytically&#8208;available surface area and the mechanical energy impact in direct mechanocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Assisted Charge Transport through Positively Charged Dimer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular charge transport plays a vital role in the fields of electronics, as well as biochemical systems. Here, we design supramolecular dimer junctions and investigate the effects of charge state and energy level alignment on charge transport under nanoconfinement. Incoherent tunneling caused by thermally&#8208;induced vibrations is enhanced in positively charged systems. The transition between coherent and incoherent tunneling is associated with specific molecular vibration modes. Positively charged systems with smaller torsional barriers and vibrational frequencies result in lower transition temperatures. Multiple thermal effects have a great impact on the conductance in the off&#8208;resonant tunneling, while thermally&#8208;induced vibron&#8208;assisted tunneling contributes more to the transport in the resonant tunneling. These investigations offer a deep mechanism understanding of intermolecular charge transport and facilitate the development of practical functional molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic Synergy in BiFeO3@COF Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructures for High&#8208;Efficiency Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is an ideal way to generate renewable energy while still challenging. For the first time, this work combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent linkages to form Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure for overall water splitting. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the polarized electric field and photo&#8208;generated charges, as well as the precise adjustment of shell thickness, the carrier separation and utilization efficiency is greatly improved. The optimal BiFeO3@TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF photocatalyst revealed hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with light irradiation, which is the best performance among various piezo&#8208; and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This provides a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatial electronic communications of chromophores are both theoretically and practically fascinating. Despite intramolecular or intermolecular exciton coupling was observed in multichromophoric oligomers and J&#8208;aggregates, respectively, it is unusual that they both occur in the same molecule. Herein, ethene&#8208;bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY dimers with intramolecular exciton splitting have been developed. By encapsulating the dimer into F&#8208;127 polymer, J&#8208;type aggregated nanoparticles were produced, which showed obvious intermolecular exciton coupling and dramatically redshifted absorption and emission peaks at 936 and 1003 nm, respectively. The fabricated nanoagents have high photothermal conversion ability (&#951; = 60.3%) and are ultra&#8208;photostable, leading to complete tumor ablation with 915 nm laser irradiation. This phototherapeutic nanoplatform through modulating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Co&#8208;Cu Diatomic Site Catalysts for High&#8208;efficiency Synergistic CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in the field of CO  2  electroreduction, but industrial&#8208;level current density and near&#8208;unity product selectivity are still difficult to achieve. Herein, a diatomic site catalysts (DASCs) consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is synthesized. The CoCu DASC exhibits excellent selectivity with the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.1%. The CO selectivity can maintain above 95% over a wide current density range from 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  to 500 mA cm  &#8208;2  . The maximum CO partial current density can reach to 483 mA cm  &#8208;2  in flow cell, far exceed industrial&#8208;level current density requirements (&gt;200 mA cm  &#8208;2  ). Theoretical calculation reveals that the synergistic catalysis of the Co&#8208;Cu bimetallic sites reducing the activation energy and promote the formation of intermediate *COOH. This work shows that the introduction of another metal atom into SACs can significantly affect the electronic structure and then enhance the catalytic activity of SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical C(sp2)&#8211;H Pyridination via Arene&#8211;PyridiniumElectron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the development of a photochemical method for C(  sp  2  )&#8211;H pyridination that leverages the photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental and DFT studies show that black light ( l  max  &#160;~ 350 nm) &#160;irradiation of solutions of protonated pyridines (acceptors) and aromatic C&#8211;H substrates (donors) results in single electron transfer to form aryl radical cation intermediates that can be trapped with pyridine nucleophiles under aerobic conditions. With some modification of the reaction conditions, this EDA activation mode is also effective for promoting the oxidatively triggered S  N  Ar pyridination of aryl halides. Overall, this represents an inexpensive and atom&#8208;economical approach to photochemical pyridination reactions in which the conjugate acid of the pyridine nucleophile is used instead of an exogenous photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>New Insights into Physical Aging&#8208;Induced Structure Evolution in Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes offer the best available combination of scalable economical processability with excellent separation performance. Physical aging of CMS membranes causes pore structure changes over time that affect CMS membrane performance. To provide fundamental insights into the structure evolution in CMS membranes during physical aging, a combined dual&#8208;mode sorption and transport model is used in this study to characterize the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in fresh and 7&#8208;day vacuum aged CMS membranes. The results show physical aging of CMS membrane is primarily &#8220;diffusion related&#8221; and such aging behavior simultaneously causes ultramicropore changes in the continuous phase and Langmuir phase of CMS membrane. The new insights offered in this study suggest strategies to control the physical aging of CMS membranes and even use it as a valuable tool to tune the separation performance of CMS membranes for demanding gas separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Tunable Ultrastrong White&#8208;Light Emission by Activation of a Solid Supramolecule through Bromonaphthylpyridinium Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported solid supramolecular bromonaphthylpyridinium polymers (P&#8208;BrNp), which exhibited tunable phosphorescence emission enabled by sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) and diarylethene derivative in amorphous state. The monomer BrNp gave single fluorescence emission at 490 nm, while an apparent RTP at 550 nm emerged for P&#8208;BrNp copolymers with various feed ratios. Benefiting from the fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence dual emission property, P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 displayed an ultrahigh white&#8208;light emission quantum yield of 83.9%. Moreover, the subsequent assembly with SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD further enhanced phosphorescent quantum yield of P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 from 64.1% up to 71.3%, accompanied by the conversion of photoluminescence emission from white to yellow. Notably, diarylethene monomers as photoswitch were also introduced into above supramolecules to realize the reversible RTP emission, which can be competently applied in switchable data encryption and multifunctional writing ink.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Nanozymes for Enantioselective Biological Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are defined as nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. This Minireview provides an overview of recent developments in chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis, with an outlook on the opportunities and trends in this research area.







Abstract
As a neat combination of the characteristics of enzymatic activity and nanomaterials, nanozymes have attracted much attention. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, substrate selectivity is often overlooked in the construction of nanozymes. With their subtly evolving structures, natural enzymes generally possess high selectivity for chiral substrates which play important roles in biosynthesis and biomedical applications. However, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of recent advances in strategies for the synthesis of chiral nanozymes and their enantioselective biological catalysis. We further focus on current challenges, potential solutions, and future developing trends of chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis. There is plenty of room to explore. This Minireview will provide new insights into the development of chiral nanozymes and their applications.

Enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation via C&#8722;H nickellation remains an elusive challenge.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Modulated Release of a Cytotoxic Photosensitizer Using Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cytotoxic photosensitizer encapsulated within a redox&#8208;sensitive biocompatible nanogel (IrNG) exhibited good biocompatibility and stability in the dark. It showed cancer&#8208;selective cytotoxicity upon photoirradiation through the dual&#8208;modulated hyperoxidation of disulfide bonds by intracellular glutathione (GSH) and photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS).







Abstract
Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hard to distinguish from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.

         <title>Atroposelective Electrophilic Sulfenylation of N&#8208;Aryl Aminoquinone Derivatives Catalyzed by Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives catalyzed by a new chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide has been achieved. Axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is a key parameter for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis. DFT calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity.







Abstract
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions. Various axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. A class of relatively flexible stereogenic C&#8722;N axes was easily constructed. The experimental results and a computational study suggested that an intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity and underscored the importance of catalyst rigidity in this sulfenylation reaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Limaspermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Kopsinine by a Nitroaryl Transfer Cascade Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Nitrobenzenesulfonamides can be exploited as functional protective groups by their use in a long&#8208;range nitroarene transfer cascade reaction. Using a suitably functionalized precursor, this process was used as the key step in the enantioselective total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinine as well as the unnatural alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tetra&#8208;hydrokopsifoline D.







Abstract
We report an intramolecular conjugate addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles/E1cb cascade of 2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonamide&#8208;functionalized cyclohexenones as a new entry to the core scaffold of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The method was applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinine, as well as the framework of the kopsifoline alkaloids, thus highlighting its complementarity to existing approaches involving the use of indole&#8208;based starting materials or the interrupted Fischer indole synthesis. Furthermore, we show that the cascade tolerates various substituents on the nitroarene, opening the way to other natural products as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.

         <title>Heck Reaction of N&#8208;Heteroaryl Halides for the Concise Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Heteroaryl&#8208;substituted Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heck reaction between N&#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins has been accomplished by adopting either a P, P=O&#8208;based ligand or (S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208; SEGPHOS, leading to the formation of a variety of nonchiral or chiral &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted heterocycles.







Abstract
The Heck reaction between N&#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic alkenes provides a convenient approach to biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl functionalized heterocycles, yet reactions of this type have been challenging due to strong N&#8208;heteroaryl coordination to palladium metal, which causes catalyst poisoning. In this report, an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction between N&#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins is established, leading to a variety of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl substituted heterocycles. The method features an unprecedented broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. The employment of a sterically bulky P, P=O ligand containing an anthryl moiety is crucial for this transformation due to the coordinative unsaturation facilitated by its steric bulkiness. The asymmetric variant of the Heck reaction is achieved with (S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS via a cationic palladium pathway, which has enabled an efficient asymmetric synthesis of (S)&#8208;nicotine and its analogues.

         <title>Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodeacetoxylation of Aryl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich aryl acetates derived from (renewable) phenolics were selectively reduced to the corresponding arenes using pinacolborane (HBpin) and a nickel&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system in the green solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The method is applicable to 4&#8208;propylguaiacyl acetate derived from pine wood.







Abstract
Acetate serves as a renewable and easily installed leaving group for selective deoxygenation of phenolics (ArOH). Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeacetoxylation of aryl acetates (Ar&#8722;OAc) with HBpin in a green carbonate solvent selectively delivers the corresponding deoxygenated arenes (ArH). The method is also applicable to highly challenging guaiacyl and syringyl acetates, leaving &#8722;OMe groups intact without arene reduction. Renewable 4&#8208;propylguaiacol obtained from pine can also be transformed without significant loss in yield versus oil derived feedstock. The observed chemoselectivity for Ar&#8722;OAc versus ArO&#8722;Ac bond cleavage was rationalized based on mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. ArOH side&#8208;product formation is attributed to direct competitive Ni&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the C=O bond. Hydrodeacyloxylation of a set of aryl alkanoates featured interesting chemoselectivity with a dramatic influence of the length and structure of the alkyl chain on catalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Porous Organic Polymer Films for High&#8208;Performance Memristors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>

The electrochemical preparation of porous organic polymer films for high&#8208;performance memristors is presented. This work will stimulate the development of porous organic polymer films in the field of advanced electron devices.







Abstract
Porous organic polymer films (PFs) with intrinsical porosity and tuneable pore environment are ideally suited for application in electronic devices. However, the huge challenges still exist for construction of electronic devices based on PFs owing to lack of robustness, processability, and controllable preparation. Herein, we report the electrochemical preparation of carbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer films (eCPFs) as switchable materials for the memristors. These eCPFs possess the characteristics of controllable thickness/size, high stability, and excellent porosity. Carbazole and cyano groups are introduced into the eCPFs to constructing electron transfer systems. Thus, the memristors constructed based on these eCPFs exhibit excellent switching performance, reliability, and reproducibility. The electrochemically controllable preparation method of porous organic polymer membranes proposed in this paper provides a feasible idea for the developments of electronic devices.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalysed Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Methane to Formaldehyde in the Presence of Liquid Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>

Aerobic oxidation of methane over Pt/TiO2 in the presence of liquid water results in the formation of formaldehyde with a selectivity of 90&#8201;% at a methane conversion of up to 3&#8201;%.







Abstract
The aerobic, selective oxidation of methane to C1&#8208;oxygenates remains a challenge, due to the more facile, consecutive oxidation of formed products to CO2. Here, we report on the aerobic selective oxidation of methane under continuous flow conditions, over platinum&#8208;based catalysts yielding formaldehyde with a high selectivity (reaching 90&#8201;% for Pt/TiO2 and 65&#8201;% over Pt/Al2O3) upon co&#8208;feeding water. The presence of liquid water under reaction conditions increases the activity strongly attaining a methane conversion of 1&#8211;3&#8201;% over Pt/TiO2. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the preferential formation of formaldehyde is linked to the stability of the di&#8208;&#963;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;methoxy species on platinum, the preferred carbon&#8208;containing species on Pt(111) at a high chemical potential of water. Our findings provide novel insights into the reaction pathway for the Pt&#8208;catalysed, aerobic selective oxidation of CH4.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergic catalytic method for asymmetric construction of N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] rings by a phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization has been developed. This route affords fluorine&#8208;installed tropane derivatives in excellent stereoselectivities. The mechanistic results revealed that the silver nitrite was installed on the phosphonium salt via hydrogen bonding and simultaneously activated the dipole, in a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model.







Abstract
We present an unprecedented synergic catalytic route for the asymmetric construction of fluorinated N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] cyclic members of tropane family via a bifunctional phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization process. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups are compatible with this method, providing targeted compounds bearing seven&#8208;membered ring and four contiguous stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The gram&#8208;scale preparations, facile elaborations and preliminary biological activities of the products demonstrate the application potential. Moreover, both experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the cyclization proceeded via a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model with multiple weak&#8208;bond cooperative activations. Insights gained from our studies are expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of challenging chiral heterocyclic molecules.

         <title>Nanographene Metallaprisms: Structure, Stimulated Transformation, and Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triangular metalloprism was constructed by supramolecular assembly of diazananographene and was transformed into a square tetramer by stimulation with C60/C70. A pair of C60/C70 molecules can be encapsulated in the square tetramer. A remarkable emission enhancement of the trapped C60 was observed, which was attributed to the formation of a confined dimer and efficient intermolecular energy transfer.







Abstract
Nanographenes are inclined to assemble into stacked columnar structures that are stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, whereas other supramolecular structures of nanographenes, such as prisms and cages, are rarely investigated. Herein, a diazananographene was synthesized, and then assembled with a coordination unit, thereby producing a triangular metallaprism. After adding C60 or C70, the triangular metallaprism was transformed into a square tetramer, which encapsulated a pair of C60 or C70 molecules. The formed host&#8208;guest complex demonstrated efficient energy transfer from the diazananographene shell to the C60 cores. The emission intensity of the capsulated C60 was enhanced remarkably, compared with free C60, due to an increased quantum yield and optical absorption coefficient. This work demonstrates the versatility of nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures beyond columnar stacking and their ability to enhance the emission of otherwise non&#8208;emissive fullerene.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functionalized Quinolines by Direct Conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of quinoline synthesis from a major lignin motif by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction path involves selective C&#8722;O bond cleavage, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, and C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. This transformation provides a new example for the application of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 segments in the construction of N&#8208;heterocyclic aromatic compounds, thus offering a petroleum&#8208;independent path to heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.







Abstract
Direct production of heterocyclic aromatic compounds from lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 models remains a huge challenge due to the incompatible catalysis for aryl ether bonds cleavage and heterocyclic ring formation. Herein, the first example of quinoline synthesis from &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction pathway involves selective cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. The control experiments suggest that both imine and chalcone were identified as the key intermediates, and the rate determining step as well as the preferred pathway were experimentally clarified and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on this protocol, the conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymer delivered 56&#8197;wt&#8201;% yield of quinoline derivative in three steps. This transformation provides a potential petroleum&#8208;independent choice for heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydrogenative C&#8722;H Alkoxylation and Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkoxylation and amination is reported. The use of cheap and readily available cobalt(II) salts as catalysts and Saloxs as chiral ligands provides an efficient method to access P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The past decade has witnessed a rapid progress in asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, the enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation and amination with alcohols and free amines remains elusive. Herein, we disclose the first enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkoxylation and amination enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The use of cheap and readily available cobalt(II) salts as catalysts and Saloxs as chiral ligands provides an efficient method to access P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatizations of the resulting P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinamides, which offering a flexible asymmetric alternative to access P&#8208;stereogenic mono&#8208; and diphosphine chiral ligands. Preliminary mechanistic studies on the enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation reaction suggest that a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle might be involved.

         <title>Temperature Dependent Properties of the Aqueous Electron

Ab&#8197;initio molecular dynamics simulations of the aqueous electron in various thermodynamic conditions at the accuracy of hybrid functional electronic structure theory are reported. This work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature.







Abstract
The temperature&#8208;dependent properties of the aqueous electron have been extensively studied using mixed quantum&#8208;classical simulations in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions based on one&#8208;electron pseudopotentials. While the cavity model appears to explain most of the physical properties of the aqueous electron, only a non&#8208;cavity model has so far been successful in accounting for the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum. Here, we present an accurate and efficient description of the aqueous electron under various thermodynamic conditions by combining hybrid functional&#8208;based molecular dynamics, machine learning techniques, and multiple time&#8208;step methods. Our advanced simulations accurately describe the temperature dependence of the absorption maximum in the presence of cavity formation. Specifically, our work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature, rather than from global density variations as previously suggested.

         <title>The Bifunctional Silyl Reagent Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3 Enables Highly Enantioselective Ketone Trifluoromethylation and Related Tandem Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional trifluoromethylsilyl reagent (BTR), Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3 is prepared, which enables ketone trifluoromethylations with excellent enantioselectivity and broad scope. Notably, by taking advantage of the chloromethyl group, a tandem synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated oxasilacyclopentanes and &#945;&#8208;CF3 tertiary alcohols with vicinal tertiary or quaternary stereocenters was developed.







Abstract
We report the development of bifunctional trifluoromethylsilyl reagents for selective trifluoromethylation. The newly developed reagent, Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3, allows highly enantioselective trifluoromethylations of ketones with broad scope. Notably, by taking advantage of the chloromethyl group, a tandem synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated oxasilacyclopentanes is developed, paving way to &#945;&#8208;CF3 tertiary alcohols with vicinal tertiary or quaternary stereocenters. Theoretical studies revealed the important role of nonclassical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;C interactions in stabilizing the transition state, and that the presence of the chlorine atom enhances such interactions for better enantiofacial control.

The newly developed reagent, Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl)SiCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, allows highly enantioselective trifluoromethylations of ketones with broad scope. Notably, by taking advantage of the chloromethyl group, a tandem synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated oxasilacyclopentanes is developed, paving way to &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; tertiary alcohols with vicinal tertiary or quaternary stereocenters. Theoretical studies revealed the important role of nonclassical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;C interactions in stabilizing the transition state, and that the presence of the chlorine atom enhances such interactions for better enantiofacial control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembled Complexes: Improved Photoswitching Properties by Metal Ion Coordination
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable ligand and PdII combine to form a [Pd2L4]4+ coordination cage. The photoswitching selectivity towards the metastable isomer is significantly improved when coordinated, allowing near&#8208;quantitatively photoswitching to a new species, [PdL2]2+. This new species stabilizes the metastable isomer, increasing the thermal half&#8208;life compared to the free ligand.







Abstract
A photoswitchable ligand based on azobenzene is self&#8208;assembled with palladium(II) ions to form a [Pd2(E&#8208;L)4]4+ cage. Irradiation with 470&#8197;nm light results in the near&#8208;quantitative switching to a monomeric species [Pd(Z&#8208;L)2]2+, which can be reversed by irradiation with 405&#8197;nm light, or heat. The photoswitching selectivity towards the metastable isomer is significantly improved upon self&#8208;assembly, and the thermal half&#8208;life is extended from 40&#8197;days to 850&#8197;days, a promising approach for tuning photoswitching properties.

         <title>Precursor Engineering to Reduce Processing Temperature of ZnO Films for Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8208;free precursor consisting of zinc acetate dehydrate (ZAH) in methanol is proposed to prepare ZnO films. The temperature required for converting the precursor complex into ZnO was as low as 90&#8201;&#176;C, which is substantially lower than that (over 120&#8201;&#176;C) required for the traditional amine&#8208;containing precursor. Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed ZnO can function efficiently as an electron&#8208;transport layer in nonfullerene solar cells.







Abstract
Sol&#8208;gel&#8208;derived ZnO is one of the most widely used electron&#8208;transport layers in inverted organic solar cells. The sol&#8208;gel ZnO precursor consists of zinc acetate dehydrate (ZAH) and ethanolamine dissolved in 2&#8208;methoxyethanol, where ethanolamine chelates with ZAH, which helps ZAH dissolve in the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol. However, an annealing temperature above 120&#8201;&#176;C is required to convert the complexes into ZnO. High temperatures are incompatible with flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate. In this work, we report an amine&#8208;free recipe consisting of ZAH in methanol to prepare ZnO films. The complex formed in the amine&#8208;free precursor solution is methanol&#8208;solvated ZAH, which is simpler than that of the amine&#8208;containing precursor solution. The temperature required for converting the precursor complex into ZnO was reduced to 90&#8201;&#176;C for the amine&#8208;free recipe. Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed ZnO can function efficiently as an electron&#8208;transport layer in both rigid and flexible inverted nonfullerene solar cells.

         <title>Intrinsic Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activate the In&#8197;Situ Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethine cyanines are synthesized from precursors, assisted by visible light, free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reaction can proceed in&#8197;situ in live cells. The correlation of cyanine expression with the intrinsic cellular ROS production level causes more efficient cyanine production in the cancer cells. The study bridges ROS&#8208;activated in&#8208;cell synthetic chemistry and cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;responsive in situ synthesis of molecular fluorescent dyes is challenging. Herein, we develop a photoextension strategy to make trimethine cyanines with decent conversion efficiency (up to 81&#8201;%) using 1&#8208;butyl 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl 3H&#8208;indole derivatives as the sole precursors, and demonstrate a free radical mechanism. In the inducer&#8208;extension stage, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were able to mediate similar reactions with no assistance of light. We explored a Mito&#8208;extension strategy to in situ synthesize trimethine cyanines in the living cells. The cellular ROS&#8208;dependence provided a foundation for preferential cyanine expression in cancer cells. Finally, we applied an iodized precursor as an intrinsic ROS&#8208;activated theranostic agent that integrated mitochondria&#8208;targeted cyanine synthesis, cell imaging and phototherapy.

         <title>A 4&#8208;Arm Small Molecule Acceptor with High Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;arm small molecule acceptor (SMA) 4A&#8208;DFIC was serendipitously made. Power conversion efficiencies of 15.76&#8201;% and 18.60&#8201;% were achieved in 4A&#8208;DFIC&#8208;based binary and ternary organic solar cells, respectively, setting new records for multi&#8208;arm SMA&#8208;based solar cells.







Abstract
Manipulating the backbone of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) is of particular importance in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). The common design is constructing 2&#8208;arm SMAs with linear or curved backbones. Herein, we report an acceptor 4A&#8208;DFIC with a 4&#8208;arm backbone unexpectedly generated in the reaction of an electron&#8208;rich aromatic diamine and hexaketocyclohexane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates the rigid and twisted molecular plane and the effective molecular stacking of 4A&#8208;DFIC in solid state. 4A&#8208;DFIC shows a low band gap of 1.40&#8197;eV and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability from visible to near&#8208;infrared region. Binary and ternary OSCs based on 4A&#8208;DFIC gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 15.76&#8201;% and 18.60&#8201;% (certified 18.1&#8201;%), respectively, which are the highest PCEs for multi&#8208;arm SMA&#8208;based OSCs to date.

This paper describes the use of a cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue for studying live cell lipid uptake by dendritic cells. The minimal oleic acid analogue is incorporated into membranes and lipoproteins, which can be studied by live cell microscopy and lipoproteomics.







Abstract
In the field of lipid research, bioorthogonal chemistry has made the study of lipid uptake and processing in living systems possible, whilst minimising biological properties arising from detectable pendant groups. To allow the study of unsaturated free fatty acids in live cells, we here report the use of sterculic acid, a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue, as a bioorthogonal probe. We show that this lipid can be readily taken up by dendritic cells without toxic side effects, and that it can subsequently be visualised using an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with quenched tetrazine&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. In addition, the lipid can be used to identify changes in protein oleoylation after immune cell activation. Finally, this reaction can be integrated into a multiplexed bioorthogonal reaction workflow by combining it with two sequential copper&#8208;catalysed Huisgen ligation reactions. This allows for the study of multiple biomolecules in the cell simultaneously by multimodal confocal imaging.

         <title>Tridecacyclene Tetraimide: An Easily Reduced Cyclooctatetraene Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacyclene tetraimide, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make molecular saddle, will accept up to eight electrons when reduced by chemical or electrochemical means. Strong near&#8208;infrared absorptions are observed for the resulting anionic species. The ultimate octaanion is an exception: it absorbs only in the visible region and has an even larger energy gap than the neutral form.







Abstract
Tridecacyclene tetraimide, TCTI, an electron&#8208;deficient non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon with a C56N4 polycyclic framework was obtained in a concise synthesis. TCTI has a non&#8208;planar structure and forms &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers in the solid state. In solution, it undergoes eight single&#8208;electron reductions, yielding a range of negatively charged states up to an octaanion. Except for the latter species, which has a remarkably large electronic gap, the anions feature extended near&#8208;infrared absorptions, with a particularly strong band at 1692&#8197;nm observed for the dianion. A computational analysis of the TCTI anions shows that their stability originates from the combined effects of electron&#8208;deficient imide groups and the local aromaticity of reduced acenaphthylene units. The properties of TCTI make it potentially useful in electrochromic and charge storage applications.

         <title>An Intelligent Nanomachine Guided by DNAzyme Logic System for Precise Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent nanomachine guided by a DNAzyme logic system was constructed for precise Chemodynamic Therapy (CDT). The nanomachine could accurately identify cell types by an in&#8208;built DNAzyme logic system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cell&#8208;specific CDT by the guidance of DNAzyme logic gate.







Abstract
The intelligent nanomachine usually has a control center to carry out self&#8208;regulation. Unfortunately, most of the nanomaterials for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) do not have such a control center to sense and process the chemical or biological signals, which greatly weakens the selectivity and efficiency of CDT. To address this problem, here an intelligent nanomachine was constructed with a DNAzyme logic gate as the control center, and metal organic framework as the actuator. The well&#8208;designed nanomachine showed an enhanced killing effect on cancer cells but posed no harm to normal cells, acquiring better selectivity than clinical chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cell&#8208;specific CDT by the guidance of DNAzyme logic gate. Our work highlights the great potential of DNAzymes in intelligent response networks, and extends the implementation of nanomachines in precision medicine.

         <title>Arene&#8208;Ruthenium(II)/Osmium(II) Complexes Potentiate the Anticancer Efficacy of Metformin via Glucose Metabolism Reprogramming</title>

Combination of arene&#8208;osmium(II) complex 5 with metformin could be used as a new strategy to treat cancer under hypoglycemia through glucose metabolism reprogramming.







Abstract
Targeting metabolic reprogramming to treat cancer could increase overall survival and reduce side effects. Here, we put forward a strategy using arene&#8208;ruthenium(II)/osmium(II) complexes to potentiate the anticancer effect of metformin (Met.) via glucose metabolism reprogramming. Complexes 1&#8211;6 with oxoglaucine derivatives as ligands were synthesized and their anti&#8208;tumor activities were tested under hypoglycemia. Results indicated that 2 and 5 potentiated the anticancer effects of Met. under hypoglycemia, exhibiting lower toxicity, slower blood glucose decline and inhibition of early tumor liver metastasis. Combination of 5 with Met. could be used as a new strategy to treat cancer under hypoglycemia through glucose metabolism reprogramming.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Rhamnose&#8208;Functionalized Bispecific Nanobody as a Bispecific Antibody Mimic for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhamnosylation of a bispecific nanobody (bsNb&#8208;Rha), as a mimic of the full&#8208;length bispecific antibody, was developed for cancer immunotherapy. The bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugate simultaneously targeted EGFR and HER2 antigens expressed on tumor cells, followed by the engagement of endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to trigger an efficient Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated immune response, leading to enhanced activity in vitro and in vivo against the dual&#8208;positive cancer cells.







Abstract
Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are next&#8208;generation therapeutics for complex cancer treatment. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;targeting non&#8208;IgG format of bsAbs by using a bispecific nanobody (bsNb) that can simultaneously target EGFR and HER2 on tumor cells. Site&#8208;specific modification of the anti&#8208;EGFR&#8208;HER2 bsNb was conducted using the rhamnose (Rha) hapten via sortase A&#8208;mediated ligation to reconstitute the missing crystallizable fragment (Fc) effector biological functions. Functionally similar to bsAbs, bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugates retained dual&#8208;targeting activity and exerted potent anticancer effects via the Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated engagement of endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies. Further, an optimized bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugate exhibited markedly improved pharmacokinetics and efficient inhibitory effects against xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Our strategy provides a general and cost&#8208;effective platform to generate a new bsAb format for cancer immunotherapy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEGylated porphyrin&#8208;peptide (PHHPEG6) building block self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers (NFs), which formed aggregates in the acidic tumor microenvironment. The pH&#8208;induced aggregation of PHHPEG6 NFs resulted in enhanced 1O2 generation efficiency and prolonged tumor retention, thus enabling control over the entire PDT process, from the visualization of photosensitizer accumulation to actual PDT and subsequent assessment of the efficacy of the treatment.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a highly promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive photosensitizer nanomaterials overcomes certain limitations in clinical PDT. Herein, we report the rational design of a highly sensitive PEGylated photosensitizer&#8208;peptide nanofiber (termed PHHPEG6 NF) that selectively aggregates in the acidic tumor and lysosomal microenvironment. These nanofibers exhibit acid&#8208;induced enhanced singlet oxygen generation, cellular uptake, and PDT efficacy in vitro, as well as fast tumor accumulation, long&#8208;term tumor imaging capacity and effective PDT in vivo. Moreover, based on the prolonged presence of the fluorescent signal at the tumor site, we demonstrate that PHHPEG6 NFs can also be applied for prognostic monitoring of the efficacy of PDT in vivo, which would potentially guide cancer treatment. Therefore, these multifunctional PHHPEG6 NFs allow control over the entire PDT process, from visualization of photosensitizer accumulation, via actual PDT to the assessment of the efficacy of the treatment.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)&#8208;Targeting DNA Nanodevice for Autophagy&#8208;Dependent Degradation of Proteins in Membrane&#8208;Bound Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new targeted protein degradation (TPD) system composed of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting DNA nanostructure carrying protein binding ligands is developed for proteins in membrane&#8208;bound organelles. It works with the guidance of artificial membrane receptors. The targeted proteins in ERs are degraded via an autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. This nanosystem compensates the deficiency of current TPD strategies and may contribute to future cancer therapeutics.







Abstract
Targeted protein degradation via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways is a promising therapeutic approach, and proteins in cytoplasm or on the cell membrane can be easily contacted and have become the major targets. However, degradation of disease&#8208;related proteins that exist in membrane&#8208;bound organelles (MBO) such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains unsolved due to the membrane limits. Here we describe a DNA nanodevice that shows ER targeting capacity and undergoes new intracellular degradation via the autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. Then the DNA nanostructure functionalized with specific ligands is used to selectively catch ER&#8208;localized proteins and then transport them to the lysosome for degradation. Through this technique, the degradation of both exogenous ER&#8208;resident protein (ER&#8208;eGFP) and endogenous overexpressed molecular chaperone (glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78) in cancer cells has been successfully executed with high efficiency.

         <title>Mesityl&#8208;Functionalized Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescent Frameworks with Wide&#8208;Range Color Tunability for Narrowband OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Deep blue to pure green boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters with a binary&#8208;doped B/N skeleton have been developed that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields up to unity, narrow band widths (FWHM &lt;40&#8197;nm), and fast radiative decay rates of about 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 . The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 39.8&#8201;% and CIEy coordinates of 0.05 when used as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters are promising for high color&#8208;purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, unlike the most common heteroatom ternary&#8208;doped (X/B/N) frameworks, a binary&#8208;doped (B/N) skeleton is reported with a large energy band for wide&#8208;range color tunability. Based on this parent&#8208;segment, a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; catalyst&#8208;free borylation method is developed which generates deep blue to pure green MR emitters from readily available starting materials, with peaks at 426&#8211;532&#8197;nm and full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maxima of 27&#8211;38&#8197;nm. Impressively, a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 40&#8201;% is recorded for the corresponding device with Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinates of (0.14, 0.16), representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of B/N&#8208;doped MR emitters and will motivate the study of other novel frameworks.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Poly(phthalocyanine) Scaffolds Derived from a Mechanochemical Approach Towards Enhanced Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed to afford fully conjugated poly(phthalocyanine (Pc)) scaffolds under neat and ambient conditions, by leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts. The as&#8208;afforded scaffolds feature a fully conjugated skeleton, abundant Pc linkages, and permanent porosity, providing them with attractive performance in energy storage.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (Pc)&#8208;derived materials represent an attractive category of porous organic scaffolds featured by extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks, but their construction is still limited to the solution&#8208;based pathways, producing materials with inferior conductivity and porosity. Herein, a mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of aromatic nitrile monomers with ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts (magnesium, zinc, or aluminum) under neat and ambient conditions. Diverse Pc&#8208;functionalized conjugated porous networks (Pc&#8208;CPNs) were obtained featured by extensively and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons, high surface areas, and hierarchical porosities. The monomers in this mechanochemical approach could be extended to those difficult to be handled in solution&#8208;based procedures. The Pc&#8208;CPNs displayed attractive electrochemical performance as supercapacitor and anodes in batteries, together with superb long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Phosphorus Tailors the d&#8208;Band Center of Copper Atomic Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective phosphidation approach was employed to tailor the Cu 3d electron energy in phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (PCN) supported single&#8208;Cu&#8208;atom catalyst by tuning its coordination environment from Cu1N3 to Cu1P3. Cu1N3@PCN with the d&#8208;band center near the Fermi level promoted CO2 photoreduction to CO, while Cu1P3@PCN with a downshifting Cu 3d electron energy favored H2 production via photocatalytic water splitting.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 into solar fuels has received great interest, but suffers from low catalytic efficiency and poor selectivity. Herein, two single&#8208;Cu&#8208;atom catalysts with unique Cu configurations in phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (PCN), namely, Cu1N3@PCN and Cu1P3@PCN were fabricated via selective phosphidation, and tested in visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by H2O without sacrificial agents. Cu1N3@PCN was exclusively active for CO production with a rate of 49.8&#8197;&#956;molCO&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming most polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) based catalysts, while Cu1P3@PCN preferably yielded H2. Experimental and theoretical analysis suggested that doping P in C3N4 by replacing a corner C atom upshifted the d&#8208;band center of Cu in Cu1N3@PCN close to the Fermi level, which boosted the adsorption and activation of CO2 on Cu1N3, making Cu1N3@PCN efficiently convert CO2 to CO. In contrast, Cu1P3@PCN with a much lower Cu 3d electron energy exhibited negligible CO2 adsorption, thereby preferring H2 formation via photocatalytic H2O splitting.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into solar fuels has received great interest, but suffers from low catalytic efficiency and poor selectivity. Herein, two single-Cu-atom catalysts with unique Cu configurations in phosphorus-doped carbon nitride (PCN), namely, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN were fabricated via selective phosphidation, and tested in visible light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O without sacrificial agents. Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN was exclusively active for CO production with a rate of 49.8&#8197;&#956;mol&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming most polymeric carbon nitride (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) based catalysts, while Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN preferably yielded H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimental and theoretical analysis suggested that doping P in C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by replacing a corner C atom upshifted the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of Cu in Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN close to the Fermi level, which boosted the adsorption and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, making Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN efficiently convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. In contrast, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN with a much lower Cu &lt;i&gt;3d&lt;/i&gt; electron energy exhibited negligible CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, thereby preferring H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation via photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Heteroaryl Imines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl imines with C(sp3) electrophiles for the preparation of heterobenzylic amines is reported. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the imine substrate acting as a redox&#8208;active ligand upon coordination to a low&#8208;valent Ni center.







Abstract
The preparation of heterobenzylic amines by a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between heteroaryl imines and C(sp3) electrophiles is reported. This umpolung&#8208;type alkylation proceeds under mild conditions, avoids the pre&#8208;generation of organometallic reagents, and exhibits good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the imine substrate acting as a redox&#8208;active ligand upon coordination to a low&#8208;valent Ni center. The resulting bis(2&#8208;imino)heterocycle&#8901;Ni complexes can engage in alkylation reactions with a variety of C(sp3) electrophiles, giving heterobenzylic amine products in good yields.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Active Supramolecular Nanotubes Based on PtII Complexes That Undergo Dynamic Morphological Transformation and Helicity Inversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral PtII complex of a terpyridine derivative has been shown to initially form a fibrous self&#8208;assembled product and then undergo dynamic transformation to helical tubes (M&#8208;type) via helical ribbons (P&#8208;type). Interestingly, the two supramolecular structures emitted opposing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals as a result of morphological differences.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with tunable chirality is currently a challenging issue in the development of supramolecular nanomaterials. We herein report the formation of helical nanoribbons which grow into helical tubes through dynamic helicity inversion. For this, chiral PtII complexes of terpyridine derivatives, namely S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 and R&#8208;trans&#8208;1, with respective S&#8208; and R&#8208;alanine subunits and incorporating trans&#8208;double bonds in the alkyl chain were prepared. In DMSO/H2O (5&#8201;:&#8201;1 v/v), S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 initially forms a fibrous self&#8208;assembled product, which then undergoes dynamic transformation into helical tubes (left&#8208;handed or M&#8208;type) through helical ribbons (right&#8208;handed or P&#8208;type). Interestingly, both helical supramolecular architectures are capable of emitting CPL signals. The metastable helical ribbons show CPL signals (glum=&#177;4.7&#215;10&#8722;2) at 570&#8197;nm. Meanwhile, the nanotubes, which are the thermodynamic products, show intense CPL signals (glum=&#177;5.6&#215;10&#8722;2) at 610&#8197;nm accompanied by helicity inversion. This study provides an efficient way to develop highly dissymmetric CPL nanomaterials by regulating the morphology of metallosupramolecular architectures.

         <title>Synthesis of an Acidochromic and Nitroaromatic Responsive Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Pillararene Framework by a Macrocycle&#8208;To&#8208;Framework Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brightly emissive hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent polymer platform based on pillar[5]arene&#8208;derived building blocks has been developed for the optical sensing of acidic pH levels as well as nitroaromatic compounds. The macrocyclic acceptors play important roles in improving the sensing sensitivity and durability, thus providing valuable insight for the construction of versatile molecular platforms with innovative structures and designable functions.







Abstract
Tailoring the properties of solid&#8208;state organic luminescent materials using a bottom&#8208;up design principle is highly desirable for many applications. Herein, we present a &#8220;macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework&#8221; strategy to construct macrocycle&#8208;functionalized and hydrazone&#8208;linked functional organic polymers with bright yellowish&#8208;green luminescence and unique solvatochromism behaviors by the condensation of a diacylhydrazine&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene with tris(4&#8208;formylbiphenyl)amine. Outperforming their non&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts, the pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing materials display amplified sensitivity to acidic conditions with luminescent and colorimetric dual&#8208;modal patterns assisted by the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and exhibit satisfactory responsiveness to nitrobenzene compounds through rapid luminescence quenching with high selectivity and a low detection limit, where the sensing process proceeds through multiple dynamic quenching pathways.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ophiorrhine&#8197;A, G and Ophiorrhiside&#8197;E Featuring a Bioinspired Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloaddition
</title>

         <dc:description>
A late stage bioinspired intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of the indolopyridone of ophiorrhiside&#8197;E was deployed to access the spirocyclic azabicyclic[2.2.2]octanone ring system of ophiorrhiside&#8197;A and achieve its total synthesis. The indolopyridone of ophiorrhiside&#8197;E was synthesized by the cyclodehydration of ophiorrhine&#8197;G which was formed by the acylation of N&#8208;methyl indolylacetamide by a secologanin derivative.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids ophiorrhine&#8197;A via a late stage bioinspired intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition to form the intricate bridged and spirannic polycyclic system. Several strategies were investigated to construct the indolopyridone moiety of ophiorrhiside&#8197;E, the postulated biosynthetic precursor of ophiorrhine&#8197;A. Eventually, the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type coupling of N&#8208;methyl indolyl&#8208;acetamide with a secologanin&#8208;derived acid chloride delivered ophiorrhine&#8197;G. Cyclodehydration of a protected form of the latter was followed by the desired spontaneous intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of protected ophiorrhiside&#8197;E leading to ophiorrhine&#8197;A.

Eventually, the Friedel&#8211;Crafts-type coupling of N-methyl indolyl-acetamide with a secologanin-derived acid chloride delivered ophiorrhine&#8197;G. Cyclodehydration of a protected form of the latter was followed by the desired spontaneous intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of protected ophiorrhiside&#8197;E leading to ophiorrhine&#8197;A.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Chelatable Porphyrinic Frameworks for Single&#8208;Cell Multiplexing with Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy for mass cytometry markers is reported using functionalized mesoporous porphyrinic frameworks (MPF) as scaffolds for chelating metals that have been difficult to integrate in conventional markers. With polyethylene glycol surface functionalization, post&#8208;synthetic metalation and antibody conjugation, the resulting MPF&#8208;based markers exhibit excellent specificity and sensitivity for multi&#8208;parameter single&#8208;cell analysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell multiplexing is key to exploration of the heterogeneous cell populations in biological systems. Although the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass cytometry (CyTOF) possesses high resolution and multiple dimensions, the lack of suitable marker materials prohibits fully exploiting the available CyTOF detection channels. Here we report a new design strategy for CyTOF markers using functionalized mesoporous porphyrinic frameworks (MPFs) as scaffolds for chelating metals that have been unachievable by conventional approaches. We developed surface modification for stably dispersing the MPF nanoparticles (&lt;40&#8197;nm) during the metalation and antibody conjugation processes. Our markers exhibit higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with a polymer&#8208;based commercial benchmark. Compatibility with commercial markers during co&#8208;staining was also confirmed. Furthermore, our markers show promising performance for immunophenotyping and potential implementation in CyTOF systems.

         <title>A Monocrystalline Coordination Polymer with Multiple Redox Centers as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination polymer of CuCA is successfully synthesized by coordinating the high&#8208;capacity carbonyl compound of chloranilic acid (CA) as organic ligand with the high&#8208;voltage Cu2+ as transition metal node. With &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, layered structure and monocrystalline nature, the resulting CuCA cathode presents inorganic and organic redox centers, high electronic conductivity and fast Li+ diffusion kinetics with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte.







Abstract
Coordination polymers can take advantage of both transition metal redox and organic ligand redox, thus serving as promising cathodes with multiple redox centers toward higher&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we selected the high&#8208;capacity carbonyl compound of chloranilic acid (CA) as organic ligand to coordinate with the high&#8208;voltage Cu2+ as transition metal node and successfully synthesized copper(II) chloranilate (CuCA) with &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, layered structure and monocrystalline nature. The resulting CuCA presents inorganic and organic redox centers, high electronic conductivity and fast Li+ diffusion kinetics, leading to high discharge capacity (297.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (160.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and good cycling stability (165.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles) with quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This work will provide insightful understanding of the materials design strategies to develop more efficient coordination polymer cathodes for LIBs.

         <title>In vivo Realization of Dual Photodynamic and Photothermal Therapy for Melanoma by Mitochondria Targeting Dinuclear Ruthenium Complexes under Civil Infrared Low&#8208;power Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear ruthenium complexes with high two&#8208;photon absorption in the IR region and photothermal conversion efficiency have been developed to target mitochondria without penetrating the nucleus for tumor therapy. They show suppressed melanoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo with dual two&#8208;photon photodynamic and photothermal therapy.







Abstract
A series of dinuclear RuII complexes with extremely high TPA cross sections in the range of 800&#8211;900&#8197;nm have been designed. The amphiphilic complex Ru3 containing tert&#8208;butyl groups has balanced performance in singlet oxygen generation and photothermal conversion and becomes the ideal drug candidate of the series. Ru3 targets mitochondria without penetrating the nucleus, which substantially increases its photodynamic therapy activity and reduces its dark cytotoxicity. Ru3 successfully suppresses melanoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo with combined photodynamic and photothermal therapy under low light dose irradiation of an 808&#8197;nm low&#8208;power laser, avoiding the known PDT resistance in melanoma. The excellent therapeutic effect of Ru3 facilitates its applications in further human trials for larger or deeper buried tumors, thereby becoming a prospective candidate for a new generation of low&#8208;power IR&#8208;driven dual PDT/PTT drugs.

The catalytic generation of unsubstituted and alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM has been developed and applied in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic generation of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM is reported. This desilylative approach grants access to &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates, which are typically difficult to access through traditional methods reliant upon deprotonation. The scope and limitations of this process is established in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition processes with perfluoroalkylketones (31 examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er), as well as selective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with trifluoromethyl enones (4 examples, up to 75&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate this process proceeds through an initial kinetic resolution of an in situ prepared (&#177;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted anhydride, while the reaction process exhibits overall pseudo zero&#8208;order kinetics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNAs protect cells from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and can be quickly adjusted to variants of concern. An alkyne moiety was integrated at the 3&#8242; end of the siRNA to enable chemical modification of the siRNA via CuI&#8208;catalysed click&#8208;chemistry. Following this strategy, the siRNA can be conjugated to receptor ligands such as hACE2&#8208;binding peptides, which allows target&#8208;specific delivery.







Abstract
The emergence of more transmissible or aggressive variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 requires the development of antiviral medication that is quickly adjustable to evolving viral escape mutations. Here we report the synthesis of chemically stabilized small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The siRNA can be further modified with receptor ligands such as peptides using CuI&#8208;catalysed click&#8208;chemistry. We demonstrate that optimized siRNAs can reduce viral loads and virus&#8208;induced cytotoxicity by up to five orders of magnitude in cell lines challenged with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Furthermore, we show that an ACE2&#8208;binding peptide&#8208;conjugated siRNA is able to reduce virus replication and virus&#8208;induced apoptosis in 3D mucociliary lung microtissues. The adjustment of the siRNA sequence allows a rapid adaptation of their antiviral activity against different variants of concern. The ability to conjugate the siRNA via click&#8208;chemistry to receptor ligands facilitates the construction of targeted siRNAs for a flexible antiviral defence strategy.

         <title>Electrocarboxylation of Aryl Epoxides with CO2 for the Facile and Selective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the electroreductive carboxylation of aryl epoxides with CO2 has been developed to provide &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids. The method exhibited broad substrate scope, could be extended to cyclic ethers with larger rings, and proved to be a powerful approach to the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product derivatives and drug molecules.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient and facile approach to valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives from readily available aryl epoxides and CO2 with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions is described. This approach showed broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. In addition to aryl epoxides, four&#8208; to six&#8208;membered aryl cyclic ethers could all be tolerated in the reaction to provide synthetically useful hydroxy acids with high efficiency. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylation of complex molecules and drug derivatives demonstrated its potential application in the pharmaceutical industry. Mechanistic studies disclosed possible reaction pathways.

         <title>Supramolecular Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded Semiconducting Nanoribbons at Work in Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bonded p&#8208;type semiconducting ribbons have been engineered through the self&#8208;assembly of tailored &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. Theoretical studies of the electronic states showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. Implementation of the ribbons as hole&#8208;transport layers in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells gave rise to devices with performances similar to those obtained with state&#8208;of&#8208;art semiconductors.







Abstract
This work describes the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated telluro[3,2&#8208;&#946;][1]&#8208;tellurophene&#8208;based synthon that, embodying pyridyl and haloaryl chalcogen&#8208;bonding acceptors, self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons through chalcogen bonds. The ribbons &#960;&#8208;stack in a multi&#8208;layered architecture both in single crystals and thin films. Theoretical studies of the electronic states of chalcogen&#8208;bonded material showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. OTFT&#8208;based charge transport measurements showed hole&#8208;transport properties for this material. Its integration as a p&#8208;type semiconductor in multi&#8208;layered CuI&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) led to a 10&#8208;fold increase in stability (38&#8197;h vs. 3&#8197;h) compared to single&#8208;layered devices. Finally, using the reference tellurotellurophene congener bearing a C&#8722;H group instead of the pyridyl N atom, a herringbone solid&#8208;state assembly is formed without charge transport features, resulting in LECs with poor stabilities (&lt;1&#8197;h).

         <title>Rational Design of Superconducting Metal Hydrides via Chemical Pressure Tuning
</title>

The DFT&#8208;Chemical Pressure method is employed to understand the role of atomic size effects in superconducting clathrate&#8208;like metal hydrides, from lattice distortions induced by large metal atoms to the stabilizing role of stuffing atoms.







Abstract
The high critical superconducting temperatures (Tcs) of metal hydride phases with clathrate&#8208;like hydrogen networks have generated great interest. Herein, we employ the Density Functional Theory&#8208;Chemical Pressure (DFT&#8208;CP) method to explain why certain electropositive elements adopt these structure types, whereas others distort the hydrogenic lattice, thereby decreasing the Tc. The progressive opening of the H24 polyhedra in MH6 phases is shown to arise from internal pressures exerted by large metal atoms, some of which may favor an even higher hydrogen content that loosens the metal atom coordination environments. The stability of the LaH10 and LaBH8 phases is tied to stuffing of their shared hydrogen network with either additional hydrogen or boron atoms. The predictive capabilities of DFT&#8208;CP are finally applied to the Y&#8722;X&#8722;H system to identify possible ternary additions yielding a superconducting phase stable to low pressures.

         <title>Homologous and Heterologous Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization from Exclusively Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral C3&#8208;symmetric monomers have been used to build chiral supramolecular polymer architectures by a symmetry&#8208;breaking process in a vortex. Subsequently, the polymers can take the role of chiral seeds to control the ensuing homologous or heterologous chiral supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Among the enticing issues of chiral origins are: how chirality is born from the initial achiral units and the mechanisms for the transfer of chiral information. In this work, by combining a physical vortex and chiral seeds, a general process is revealed to generate chiral supramolecular polymers from achiral C3&#8208;symmetric molecules. The symmetry&#8208;broken assemblies from the achiral molecules could work as chiral seeds to initiate the polymerization of either homologous or heterologous achiral monomers. Concomitantly, the fragmentation of the polymer caused by the vortex during the nucleation&#8208;elongation stages is shown to enlarge the domains of the chiral nuclei and then guide the polymer to grow into the predominant helicity with a high reactivity ratio. Moreover, the chiral structural information can be stored in different forms of assemblies. These new polymerization modes will provide guidance for the preparation of chiral materials.

         <title>Deciphering the Metal Speciation in Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Complexes by IMS&#8208;MS: Application to the Detection of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimics in Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) effectively distinguishes between first&#8208;row divalent transition metal complexes, despite very similar ionic radii of the ions. The speciation study of two Mn&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics (or mimics) was performed in intricate cell lysates using IMS coupled to mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS). Quantification was performed by comparison with a standard consisting of an analogous 13C6&#8208;CoII heavy ligand.







Abstract
The detection and quantification of exogenous metal complexes are crucial to understanding their activity in intricate biological media. MnII complexes are difficult to detect and quantify because of low association constants, and high lability. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic (or mimetic) labelled Mn1 is based on a 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aminoethane functionalized with imidazole and phenolate and has good intrinsic anti&#8208;superoxide, antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;activated intestinal epithelial HT29&#8208;MD2 cells, similar to that of its propylated analogue labelled Mn1P. Ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) is a powerful technique for separating low molecular weight (LMW) metal complexes and can even separate complexes with the same ligand but bound to different divalent metal cations with similar ionic radii. We demonstrated the intracellular presence of the Mn1 and Mn1P complexes, at least partly intact, in lysates of cells incubated with the complexes and estimated the intracellular Mn1P concentration using a Co&#8208;13C6 analogue.

         <title>Direct and Selective Electrocarboxylation of Styrene Oxides with CO2 for Accessing &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2 in an undivided cell to yield synthetically important &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids is described. CO2 functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions.







Abstract
Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2 in an undivided cell is reported. This reaction shows broad substrate scopes within styrene oxides under mild conditions, providing practical and scalable access to important synthetic intermediate &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids. Mechanistic studies show that CO2 functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions. Cathodically generated &#945;&#8208;radical and &#945;&#8208;carbanion intermediates lead to the regioselective formation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylation products.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries Enabled by Amidoxime&#8208;Functionalized Ion&#8208;Selective Polymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly ion&#8208;selective robust membranes are developed from a series of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs), which enable long lifetime operation of aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) using low&#8208;cost organic redox molecules at benign near&#8208;neutral pH, offering cost&#8208;effective electricity storage for grid&#8208;scale renewable power sources.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) based on aqueous organic electrolytes are a promising technology for safe and cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. Membrane separators are a key component in RFBs, allowing fast conduction of charge&#8208;carrier ions but minimizing the cross&#8208;over of redox&#8208;active species. Here, we report the molecular engineering of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs) by tuning their polymer chain topology and pore architecture to optimize membrane ion transport functions. AO&#8208;PIM membranes are integrated with three emerging aqueous organic flow battery chemistries, and the synergetic integration of ion&#8208;selective membranes with molecular engineered organic molecules in neutral&#8208;pH electrolytes leads to significantly enhanced cycling stability.

         <title>Thermally Depolymerizable Polyether Electrolytes for Convenient and Low&#8208;Cost Recycling of LiTFSI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of F&#8208;containing thermally depolymerizable polyethers were prepared as solid electrolytes, and with the help of the thermal degradation of polyethers, the LiTFSI was successfully reclaimed in high yields of 80&#8201;%, providing an example for the recycling of LiTFSI and benefiting the cost control of solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide)) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries, owing to their good interfacial contact with solid electrodes. Here, three copolymerized polyethers were prepared as SPEs, using the catalysts of SnF2 or SnF2&#8208;LiPF6. The thermal depolymerization of these polyethers was observed at elevated temperatures, which limits their operating temperature ranges. Once the catalyst is removed, the thermal degradation temperatures of these SPEs are raised by 30&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C, together with improved thermal performance in cells. For SPEs, the high price of LiTFSI is an obstacle for their large&#8208;scale application, and it's recycling is hindered by the strong interaction with polymers. By the thermal depolymerization of polyethers, LiTFSI can be easier reclaimed from above mentioned SPEs and even the commercial PEO(poly(ethylene&#8208;oxide)) based SPE in rates of 70&#8211;80&#8201;%, providing a low&#8208;cost strategy for the recycling of LiTFSI.

         <title>Luminescence and Length Control in Nonchelated d8&#8208;Metallosupramolecular Polymers through Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of a PtII complex with a monodentate ligand design based on self&#8208;complementary H&#8208;bonding initially affords a non&#8208;luminescent supramolecular polymer (SP). Pathway control then enables a consecutive transformation to an SP exhibiting close Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts with long&#8208;lived 3MMLCT emission. Apart from luminescence, the Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8208;interactions also enable control over the size of the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) of d8 transition metal complexes have received considerable attention by virtue of their rich photophysical properties arising from metal&#8208;metal interactions. However, thus far, the molecular design is restricted to complexes with chelating ligands due to their advantageous preorganization and strong ligand fields. Herein, we demonstrate unique pathway&#8208;controllable metal&#8208;metal&#8208;interactions and remarkable 3MMLCT luminescence in SPs of a non&#8208;chelated PtII complex. Under kinetic control, self&#8208;complementary bisamide H&#8208;bonding motifs induce a rapid self&#8208;assembly into non&#8208;emissive H&#8208;type aggregates (1A). However, under thermodynamic conditions, a more efficient ligand coplanarization leads to superiorly stabilized SP 1B with extended Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions and remarkably long 3MMLCT luminescence (&#964;77&#8201;K=0.26&#8197;ms). The metal&#8208;metal interactions could be subsequently exploited to control the length of the emissive SPs using the seeded&#8208;growth approach.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymers (SPs) of d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; transition metal complexes have received considerable attention by virtue of their rich photophysical properties arising from metal-metal interactions. However, thus far, the molecular design is restricted to complexes with chelating ligands due to their advantageous preorganization and strong ligand fields. Herein, we demonstrate unique pathway-controllable metal-metal-interactions and remarkable &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MMLCT luminescence in SPs of a non-chelated Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex. Under kinetic control, self-complementary bisamide H-bonding motifs induce a rapid self-assembly into non-emissive H-type aggregates (&lt;b&gt;1A&lt;/b&gt;). However, under thermodynamic conditions, a more efficient ligand coplanarization leads to superiorly stabilized SP &lt;b&gt;1B&lt;/b&gt; with extended Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions and remarkably long &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MMLCT luminescence (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;77&#8201;K&lt;/sup&gt;=0.26&#8197;ms). The metal-metal interactions could be subsequently exploited to control the length of the emissive SPs using the seeded-growth approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction Rate Acceleration of Cooperative Catalytic Systems: Metal Nanoparticles and Lewis Acids in Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arene hydrogenation was greatly accelerated by a cooperative catalytic system that consisted of heterogeneous Rh&#8208;Pt nanoparticles and Lewis acids. Remarkably, particularly challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents could be smoothly hydrogenated.







Abstract
Employing two distinct catalysts in one reaction medium synergistically is a powerful strategy for activating less reactive substrates. Although the approach has been well&#8208;developed in homogeneous conditions, it remains challenging and rare in heterogeneous catalysis, especially under gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase reaction conditions. Here, we describe the development of cooperative and synergistic catalyst systems of heterogeneous Rh&#8208;Pt bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, Rh&#8208;Pt/DMPSi&#8208;Al2O3, and Sc(OTf)3 in the liquid phase for the hydrogenation of arenes under very mild conditions. Dramatic rate acceleration was achieved with cooperative activation. Remarkably, more challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents were smoothly hydrogenated. Mechanistic insights into the cooperative activation of an aromatic substrate by heterogeneous metal nanoparticles and a soluble Lewis acid was obtained by kinetic studies and by direct observation of 1H and 45Sc NMR spectra.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 38/2022)</title>

Synergistic catalysis with a dipeptide phosphonium salt and a Lewis acid is used by Zhishan Su, Tianli Wang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202207334) for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] ring systems. The picture shows the key transition state of the reaction, with the phosphonium salt placed in the top left, and the alkenyl sulfone and cyclic imine substrates in the bottom left and right, respectively. The silver nitrite in the center connects catalyst and substrate via &#8220;lightnings&#8221; that symbolize hydrogen&#8208;bonding and coordination interactions, and the product exits towards the top right.

Within the crowded cell environment , Mn&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics were detected and quantified, with an analogous [13C6LCoII] (L=ligand) as a standard, in intricate cell lysates by using ion mobility spectrometry coupled to mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS). In their Research Article (e202203066), Clotilde Policar and co&#8208;workers show that IMS is powerful enough to separate complexes of the same ligand bound to different divalent metal cations with similar ionic radii. In timsTOF, ions are pushed by the gas flow, retained electrostatically, and as represented in the picture, the smaller, the slower.

Chiral platinum(II) complexes of terpyridine derivatives, S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 and R&#8208;trans&#8208;1, with S&#8208; and R&#8208;alanine subunits incorporating trans&#8208;double bonds in the alkyl chain, were prepared by Sang&#8197;Kyu Kwak, Youngmin You, Jong&#8197;Hwa Jung et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202207310). The helical ribbon structure based on S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 showed right&#8208;handed (P&#8208;type) helicity whereas the tubular structure based on S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 showed left&#8208;handed (M&#8208;type) helicity. However, the CPL signal of the nanotubes, which originates from metal&#8211;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MMLCT), was opposite to the CD signal.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbituril has shown great potential as an important building block of various functional polymers because of its strong, but dynamic, interactions with guest molecules. This Minireview summarizes the most recent examples of cucurbituril&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (CSPs) for biomedical applications. The design principles of CSPs and their unique advantages for biomedical applications, as well as the developmental trends and future perspectives of this cross&#8208;disciplinary area are discussed.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) have attracted broad interest because of their intriguing features and functions. Host&#8211;guest interactions often impart tunable physicochemical properties, reversible hierarchical organization, and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to SPs for diverse biomedical applications. Characterized by strong but dynamic interactions with guest molecules, cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) has shown great potential as an important building block of various functional polymers for biomedical applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the most recent examples regarding the design, fabrication, and biomedical applications of CB[n]&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (CSPs), which are categorized as noncovalent and covalent CSPs according to the interactions between the CB[n] and polymer backbones. The design principles of CSPs and their unique advantages for biomedical applications, as well as the developmental trends and future perspectives of this cross&#8208;disciplinary area are also discussed.

         <title>Heterogenised Molecular Catalysts for Sustainable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support materials such as carbon&#8208;based supports, MOFs, COFs, titania, and polymer gels can enhance the stability and selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction catalysts, including those based on earth&#8208;abundant elements, while also providing an effective means for the heterogenisation of molecular electrocatalysts into porous and scalable materials. The performances of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems are compared and the prospects of the field discussed in this Review.







Abstract
There has been a rapid rise in interest regarding the advantages of support materials to protect and immobilise molecular catalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in order to overcome the weaknesses of many well&#8208;known catalysts in terms of their stability and selectivity. In this Review, the state of the art of different catalyst&#8208;support systems for the CO2RR is discussed with the intention of leading towards standard benchmarking for comparison of such systems across the most relevant supports and immobilisation strategies, taking into account these multiple pertinent metrics, and also enabling clearer consideration of the necessary steps for further progress. The most promising support systems are described, along with a final note on the need for developing more advanced experimental and computational techniques to aid the rational design principles that are prerequisite to prospective industrial upscaling.

         <title>Effect of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed and Intercalated (Oxy)anions on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Oxy)anions can surface&#8208;adsorb on and intercalate into oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. There, they can affect the catalyst's electronic properties and interlayer spacing, stabilizing OER intermediates and potentially breaking the *OH/*OOH scaling relations, as described in this Minireview. Thus, adding (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new OER design dimension.







Abstract
As the kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the decarbonization of our society, a wide range of (pre)catalysts with various non&#8208;active&#8208;site elements (e.g., Mo, S, Se, N, P, C, Si&#8230;) have been investigated. Thermodynamics dictate that these elements oxidize during industrial operation. The formed oxyanions are water soluble and thus predominantly leach in a reconstruction process. Nevertheless, recently, it was unveiled that these thermodynamically stable (oxy)anions can adsorb on the surface or intercalate in the interlayer space of the active catalyst. There, they tune the electronic properties of the active sites and can interact with the reaction intermediates, changing the OER kinetics and potentially breaking the persisting OER *OH/*OOH scaling relations. Thus, the addition of (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new design dimension for OER catalysis and the herein discussed observations deepen the understanding of the role of anions in the OER.

         <title>The Impact of Boron Hybridisation on Photocatalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fruitful merger of organoboron chemistry and photocatalysis has led to the development of new technologies to access complex (non)borylated frameworks. Central to the success is control of boron hybridisation. This Minireview highlights the current state of the art in photocatalytic processes utilising organoboron compounds, paying particular attention to the role of boron hybridisation for the target transformation.







Abstract
Recently the fruitful merger of organoboron chemistry and photocatalysis has come to the forefront of organic synthesis, resulting in the development of new technologies to access complex (non)borylated frameworks. Central to the success of this combination is control of boron hybridisation. Contingent on the photoactivation mode, boron as its neutral planar form or tetrahedral boronate can be used to regulate reactivity. This Minireview highlights the current state of the art in photocatalytic processes utilising organoboron compounds, paying particular attention to the role of boron hybridisation for the target transformation.

         <title>Facile Benzylic Alkylation of Arenes with Alcohols by Catalysis with Spirocyclic NHC IrIII Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile IrIII&#8208;catalyzed benzylic alkylation of arenes with alcohols has been accomplished via borrowing hydrogen (BH) pathways, and the newly developed spirocyclic NHC IrIII pincer complex (Cat A) serves as an efficient catalyst for this atom&#8208;economical and greener transformation. Some drug or bioactive molecules and functional material templates can be easily constructed by this strategy.







Abstract
A facile benzylic alkylation of indenes and other arenes was developed from readily available primary and secondary alcohols using our newly investigated CCC pincer IrIII catalyst (SNIr&#8722;H). Excellent regioselectivity and yield (89&#8201;%) of the C3&#8208;alkylated indenes were obtained. Additionally, the challenging sp2C&#8208;alkylation was readily accomplished. This method could be utilized for the synthesis of the analogs of a histamine H1 receptor antagonist and the functional material template molecule, indeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene. A hemilabile IrIII&#8208;dihydride intermediate was proposed based on control experiments and previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the borrowing hydrogen mechanism and is key to the success of this IrIII catalyst in the reduction of unactivated multi&#8208;substituted olefin intermediates.

         <title>Pharmacological Chaperones for GCase that Switch Conformation with pH Enhance Enzyme Levels in Gaucher Animal Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational equilibrium in aqueous solution of polyhydroxylated iminoxylitols is related to the ammonium pKa. Engineering of its basicity through chemical modification allows modulation of the pKa value into the physiologically relevant 7.0&#8211;4.5 range. This optimizes GCase inhibition in the intraluminal conditions of the ER, but weakens binding in the more acidic environment of the lysosome.







Abstract
Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations which destabilize the native folded form of GCase, triggering degradation and ultimately resulting in low enzyme activity. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) which stabilize mutant GCase have been used to increase lysosomal activity through improving trafficking efficiency. By engineering their inherent basicity, we have synthesized PCs that change conformation between the ER and the lysosomal environment, thus weakening binding to GCase after its successful trafficking to the lysosome. NMR studies confirmed the conformational change while X&#8208;ray data reveal bound conformations and binding modes. These results were further corroborated by cell studies showing increases in GCase activity when using the pH&#8208;switchable probe at low dosing. Preliminary in vivo assays with humanized mouse models of Gaucher showed enhanced GCase activity levels in relevant tissues, including the brain, further supporting their potential.

         <title>A Cathode Interface Layer Based on 4,5,9,10&#8208;Pyrene Diimide for Highly Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel self&#8208;doped molecules named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are developed as cathode interfacial materials for OSCs. The devices based on t&#8208;PyDINBr and t&#8208;PyDINO exhibit PCEs of 17.24&#8201;% and 17.56&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN even reached a PCE of 18.25&#8201;%, which is improved by 51.3&#8201;% compared with that of the device without a cathode interfacial layer. This result is among the best efficiencies reported to date.







Abstract
Efficient cathode interfacial layers (CILs) are becoming essential elements for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the absorption of commonly used cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) is either too weak or overlaps too much with that of photoactive materials, hindering their contribution to the light absorption. In this work, we demonstrate the construction of highly efficient CIMs based on 2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (t&#8208;PyDI) framework. By introducing amino, amino N&#8208;oxide and quaternary ammonium bromide as functional groups, three novel self&#8208;doped CIMs named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are synthesized. These CIMs are capable of boosting the device performances by broadening the absorption, forming ohmic contact at the interface of active layer and electrode, as well as facilitating electron collection. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.25&#8201;%, which is among the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Binding Iodide Anions over Other Halide Ions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocycle M4+ and a cage C6+ were self&#8208;assembled by hydrazone formation in acidic aqueous solution. The cage is capable of encapsulating I&#8722; selectively over other halide anions in water; the macrocycle does not exhibit any recognition towards these other anions.







Abstract
A triangular&#8208;prism shaped cage was self&#8208;assembled by the formation of a dynamic covalent bond, namely a hydrazone, in acidic aqueous solution. The hexacationic host bears a number of relatively acidic protons pointing inside the cage cavity, which is able to accommodate an iodide anion selectively in water over other halide anions such as F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722;, which are more hydrated. As a comparison, a macrocycle analogue bearing fewer positive charges and fewer hydrogen bond donors shows no anion binding ability. As inferred from the single&#8208;crystal structure and theoretical calculations, the ability of the cage to selectively recognize iodide anions results from the combination of electrostatic forces, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722; hydrogen bonds, and the hydrophobic effect.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis and Investigation of the Non&#8208;Enzymatic Chemistry of Oxazinin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first biomimetic total synthesis of natural product oxazinin A is reported. A biosynthetic precursor was synthesized and reacted with anthranilic acid to give oxazinin A. Further investigation of the non&#8208;enzymatic formation of oxazinin A using 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR allowed us to monitor the reaction in real time. The synthetic route is amenable for the synthesis of diverse sets of analogs around the oxazinin scaffold to study the structure&#8211;activity relationship.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of an antimycobacterial natural product oxazinin A that takes advantage of a multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of anthranilic acid and a precursor polyketide containing an aldehyde. The route utilized for the synthesis of the pseudodimeric oxazinin A validates a previously proposed biosynthetic mechanism, invoking a non&#8208;enzymatic pathway to the complex molecule. We found a 76&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;5 ratio of oxazinin diastereomers from the synthetic cascade, which is an identical match to that found in the fermentation media from the fungus Eurotiomycetes 110162. Further investigation of the non&#8208;enzymatic formation of oxazinin A using 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR spectroscopy allowed for a plausible determination of the stepwise mechanism. The developed route is highly amenable for the synthesis of diverse sets of analogs around the oxazinin scaffold to study structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR).

         <title>Picolinamides and Iodoalkynes Enable Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed syn&#8208;Aminoalkynylation of Di&#8208; and Trisubstituted Alkenes to Give Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, syn&#8208;selective aminoalkynylation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted olefins to afford pyrrolidines is developed. The combination of iodoalkynes and a picolinamide as nucleophile is shown to be essential for the observed reactivity. Furthermore, the picolinamide enables the rapid synthesis of cyclization substrates through a C&#8722;H activation approach.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkynylation of electronically unbiased olefins with iodoalkynes is reported. The picolinamide auxiliary enables for the first time the syn&#8208;selective aminoalkynylation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes to afford the corresponding pyrrolidines in up to 97&#8201;% yield and as single diastereomers. Furthermore, through a C&#8722;H activation approach, the picolinamide allows the rapid synthesis of functionalized olefins, which are suitable cyclization precursors. Facile and orthogonal deprotection of the amides and SiiPr3&#8208;acetylenes in the products, and a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction is demonstrated.

         <title>The Highest Oxidation State of Rhodium: Rhodium(VII) in [RhO3]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Teaming up with technetium and ruthenium, rhodium is the third element of the 4d series to form the rare +7 oxidation state, the third&#8208;highest oxidation state among all elements. Here, gas&#8208;phase X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, are used to elucidate 
 as a 
 trioxido rhodium(VII) cation in 
 point group symmetry, the first chemical species with rhodium in the +7 oxidation state.







Abstract
Although the highest possible oxidation states of all transition elements are rare, they are not only of fundamental interest but also relevant as potentially strong oxidizing agents. In general, the highest oxidation states are found in the electron&#8208;rich late transition elements of groups 7&#8211;9 of the periodic table. Rhodium is the first element of the 4d transition metal series for which the highest known oxidation state does not equal its group number of 9, but reaches only a significantly lower value of +6 in exceptional cases. Higher oxidation states of rhodium have remained elusive so far. In a combined mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical study of gas&#8208;phase
 (n=1&#8211;4), we identify 
 as the 
 trioxidorhodium(VII) cation, the first chemical species to contain rhodium in the +7 oxidation state, which is the third&#8208;highest oxidation state experimentally verified among all elements in the periodic table.

         <title>Unusual Size Effect in Ion and Charge Transport in Micron&#8208;Sized Particulate Aluminum Anodes of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual size effect in ion and charge transport in micron&#8208;sized particulate aluminum anodes is recognized for the first time and the underlying reason has been revealed by experimental and theoretical investigations.







Abstract
Aluminum is a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity, excellent conductivity, and natural abundance. An anomalous size effect was observed for micron&#8208;sized aluminum powder electrodes in this work. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the insulating oxide surface layer is the underlying cause, which leads to poor electrical conductivity and limited capacity utilization when the particle is too small. Additionally, poor electrolyte wettability also accounts for the hindered reaction kinetics due to the weak polarity feature of the oxide layer. Surface grafting of polar amino groups was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve electrolyte wettability. The present work revealed the critical limitations and underlying mechanisms for the aluminum anode, which is crucial for its practical application. Our results are also valuable for other metallic anodes with similar issues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of high energy consumption and safety hazards of conventional thermocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation with an excess of H2 were solved by developing a light&#8208;field assisted route in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor, without H2, at room temperature. In comparison with the commercial catalyst, it shows superior catalytic performance in respect to activity, selectivity and stability, combined with high industrial applicability.







Abstract
Sustainable processes for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes/alkadienes impurities in alkenes feedstocks are in great demand in industry as the utilization of excessive hydrogen, high temperature and unsatisfactory alkenes selectivity of the current thermo&#8208;catalytic route, however, their development is still challenging. Herein, we innovate a light&#8208;assisted semi&#8208;hydrogenation process in gas&#8208;feed fixed bed reactor, with water as hydrogen atom source by in situ photocatalysis. Using Pd/TiO2 as model catalyst, this process shows an excellent catalytic performance for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, with 100&#8201;% of butenes selectivity at &#8776;99&#8201;% of conversion over 180&#8197;h of reaction at ambient temperature driven by 66&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of irradiation intensity. This light&#8208;driven, H2&#8208;free, ambient temperature semi&#8208;hydrogenation process, with superior performance to that of thermocatalytic route, shows attractive to bring an evolution in industrial hydrogenation technology to an economical and safe way.

         <title>An Optically Anisotropic Crystal with Large Birefringence Arising from Cooperative &#960; Orbitals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anisotropic crystal CsH2C6N9&#8901;H2O consists of (H2C6N9)&#8722; anion units in which the &#960; orbitals of the constituent (C3N3) ring and linear &#8722;(N&#8722;C&#8801;N)&#8722; moieties are cooperative. As a result, the crystal exhibits very large birefringence of up to 0.55@550&#8197;nm. This attribute enables it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent materials are highly demanded for high&#8208;performance polarized optics. As compared with artificial anisotropic metamaterials, anisotropic crystals have advantages of low optical losses and easy processing, but their birefringence is still limited. Herein, based on first&#8208;principles studies, we identified a new type of functional anion units, (HxC6N9)(3&#8722;x)&#8722; (x=0, 1, 2), and then successfully synthesized a new anisotropic crystal, namely, CsH2C6N9&#8901;H2O (I), whose crystal structure consists of (H2C6N9)&#8722; anions. Remarkably, I is ultraviolet transparent and exhibits very large birefringence of about 0.55@550&#8197;nm, which is much larger than those of commercial birefringent crystals. These results make I a candidate for highly efficient manipulation of optics and light in optical modulation devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that large birefringence mainly arises from the cooperative &#960; orbitals in (H2C6N9)&#8722; anions. This work provides a new insight on the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships of anisotropic crystals.

         <title>Super&#8208;Coordinated Nickel N4Ni1O2 Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2O2 electrosynthesis catalyst containing super&#8208;coordinated single nickel sites, that is, ones coordinated by four nitrogen and two O atoms (i.e., N4Ni1O2) on carboxyl functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes is developed. It gives a 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a cathodic energy efficiency of approximately 82&#8201;% and a H2O2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of around 96&#8201;% at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 on single&#8208;atom catalysts has attracted great attention, yet the quest for robust catalysts is driven by achieving &gt;90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) under industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Herein we synthesize a catalyst that contains single nickel site coordinated by four nitrogen and two oxygen atoms (i.e., N4Ni1O2) via involving carboxyl functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes as a substrate to provide extra O coordination to the regular NiN4 site. It has a cathodic energy efficiency of approximately 82&#8201;% and a H2O2 FE of around 96&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density, outperforming the reported single&#8208;atom catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Alkaline Electrolyte for Electrically Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries with Long&#8208;Term Operation Stability in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost zinc acetate electrolyte was introduced for electrically rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery for the first time, which could achieve a long&#8208;term operation stability in ambient air without any special cell engineering. The battery reaction mechanism of reversible formation/decomposition of zinc hydroxyacetate dihydrate was revealed using well&#8208;designed electrochemical and analytical techniques.







Abstract
Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries attract extensive research interests due to their potentially high energy density and low cost but suffer from chemical instability and poor electrochemical reversibility caused by the corrosive nature of the conventional alkaline electrolyte. Here we demonstrate a non&#8208;alkaline zinc acetate electrolyte for electrically rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries with long&#8208;term operation stability (&gt;600&#8197;hours) in ambient air without any special cell engineering. The unique battery chemistry with reversible formation/decomposition of zinc hydroxyacetate dihydrate is systematically revealed using diversified electrochemical and analytical techniques. Furthermore, the carbon&#8208;based air cathode is modified towards a hydrophilic surface to increase the energy efficiency. This work provides new insight on effective electrolyte design to achieve long&#8208;term operation zinc&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Carbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allylic Alcohols and Organoalanes with 1&#8197;atm CO Enabled by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct chemoselective carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of allylic alcohols and organoalanes with 1&#8197;atm CO via nickel catalysis has been developed to access the &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with broad scope. The use of organoalanes as both the coupling components and the activators for the alcohol functionalization was found to be both crucial and advantageous as the method does not require any external activators.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of allylic alcohols and organoalanes with CO at atmospheric pressure is reported, enabling the expedient formation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with broad scope. Particularly, the chemoselective allylic carbonylation of diols further highlights the practicability of this protocol. The leverage of organoalanes as both the coupling components and the activators for the alcohol functionalization is crucial for this method, thus no extraneous activators are required.

         <title>Thermochromic Phosphors Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Chains Showing Solid&#8208;State Photoluminescence Efficiency Exceeding 99&#8201;%</title>

A novel thermochromic 1D&#8208;Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 hybrid phosphor with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency is reported involving a mechanism of reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation induced by temperature&#8208;responsive concerted Cu atom migration in ionic copper&#8208;iodine chains.







Abstract
Thermochromic phosphors are intriguing materials for realizing thermochromic behaviors of light&#8208;emitting diodes. Here a highly luminescent and stable thermochromic phosphor based on one&#8208;dimensional Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 is reported. This unique ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based hybrid exhibits near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency owing to the through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer character of relevant electronic transitions. More importantly, an alternative mechanism of thermochromic phosphorescence was unraveled, supported by a first principles simulation of concerted copper atom migration in the copper&#8208;iodine chain. Furthermore, we successfully fabricate a bright thermochromic light&#8208;emitting diode using this Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 thermochromic phosphor. Our reported flexible ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based thermochromic luminescent material represents a new type of cost&#8208;effective functional phosphor.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of the Spiroindimicin Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the spiroindimicin family of natural products with both [5,5] and [5,6] spiro&#8208;ring skeletons was achieved via a biomimetic &#8220;dimerize&#8208;and&#8208;divert&#8221; strategy. A biocatalytic process for the oxidative dimerization of L&#8208;tryptophan was developed for the preparation of a bis&#8208;indole intermediate, which was converted to spiroindimicins via regioselective oxidative C3&#8242;&#8722;C2&#8242;&#8242; and C3&#8242;&#8722;C4&#8242;&#8242; couplings.







Abstract
A unified strategy for the biomimetic total synthesis of the spiroindimicin family of natural products was reported. Key transformations include a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dimerization of L&#8208;tryptophan/5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan to afford the bis&#8208;indole precursors chromopyrrolic acid/5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid, and regioselective C3&#8242;&#8722;C2&#8242;&#8242; and C3&#8242;&#8722;C4&#8242;&#8242; bond formation converting a common bis&#8208;indole skeleton to two skeletally different natural products, including (&#177;)&#8208;spiroindimicins&#8197;D and G with a [5,5] spiro&#8208;ring skeleton, and (&#177;)&#8208;spiroindimicins&#8197;A and H with a [5,6] spiro&#8208;ring skeleton, respectively.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles Enabled by Underexplored Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles from readily available amines was achieved. Key to the disclosed strategy was the development and implementation of reactive &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, providing access to structurally and functionally diverse products. Application of the method is showcased in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.







Abstract
Cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles are featured in various biologically active compounds and represent attractive scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. However, synthesis routes to access structurally and functionally diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles remain underexplored. Leveraging novel &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, we report a general approach for the direct and modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused lactams from unsaturated amines. The operationally simple transformation, which proceeds through successive acylation, (3+2) cycloaddition and fragmentation, tolerates a broad range of functional groups and yields a wide spectrum of complex molecular scaffolds, including fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. We demonstrate the utility of this transformation in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.

         <title>Light&#8208; and Field&#8208;Controlled Diffusion, Ejection, Flow and Collection of Liquid at a Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensionally steered liquid transport at nanoporous liquid crystal polymer coatings is realized by sequential UV exposure and electric field application. UV induces through&#8208;thickness unidirectional liquid secretion. The subsequently applied electric field reallocates the ejected liquid to predesigned locations. Interestingly, UV&#8208;gated liquid transport is revealed, which dramatically decreases both threshold voltage and threshold frequency.







Abstract
Liquid manipulation at solid surfaces has attracted plenty of interest yet most of them are limited to one or two direction(s), while transport in three dimensions is largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate three&#8208;dimensionally steered dynamic liquid mobility at nanoporous liquid crystal polymer coatings. To this end, we orchestrate liquid motion via sequential triggers of light and/or electric field. Upon a primary flood exposure to UV light, liquid is ejected globally over the entire coating surfaces. We further reallocate the secreted liquid by applying a secondary electric field stimulus. By doing so, the liquid is transported and collected at pre&#8208;set positions as determined by the electrode positions. We further monitor this process in real&#8208;time and perform precise analysis. Interestingly, when applying those two triggers simultaneously, we discover a UV&#8208;gated liquid&#8208;release effect, which decreases threshold voltage as well as threshold frequency.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization and C&#8722;C Bond Activation to Access Non&#8208;canonical Tricyclic Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic Fe&#8722;NO complex catalyses the cycloisomerization of cyclopropyl enyne to fused non&#8208;canonical cyclobutanes with up to four consecutive stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity. Only Ag(+I) was found to show comparable activity, albeit significantly lower reactivity.







Abstract
Cycloisomerizations are powerful skeletal rearrangements that allow the construction of complex molecular architectures in an atom&#8208;economic way. We present here an unusual type of cyclopropyl enyne cycloisomerization that couples the process of a cycloisomerization with the activation of a C&#8722;C bond in cyclopropanes. A set of substituted non&#8208;canonical tricyclic cyclobutanes were synthesized under mild conditions using [(Ph3P)2Fe(CO)(NO)]BF4 as catalyst in good to excellent yields with high levels of stereocontrol.

         <title>Molecular Iron Oxide Clusters Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Platinum Electrocatalysts at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>

Significant oxygen reduction reaction reactivity enhancements are observed when aqueous solutions containing iron oxide clusters {Fe28} are used as electrolyte. Mechanistic, experimental and theoretical studies explore possible roles of this polyion in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key energy conversion process, which is critical for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Here, we report the significant enhancement of the ORR&#8208;performance of commercial platinum&#8208;on&#8208;carbon electrocatalysts when operated in aqueous electrolyte solutions (pH&#8197;5.6), containing the polyoxoanion [Fe28(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(L&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;tart)16(CH3COO)24]20&#8722;. Mechanistic studies provide initial insights into the performance&#8208;improving role of the iron oxide cluster during ORR. Technological deployment of the system is demonstrated by incorporation into a direct formate microfluidic fuel cell (DFMFC), where major performance increases are observed when compared with reference electrolytes. The study provides the first examples of iron oxide clusters in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Radical Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical radical allylation reaction was developed in high yields with excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 93&#8201;% ee). The single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;based enantioselective electrocatalytic routes would be applied as an alternative approach for the development of a wide range of useful stereocontrolled reactions.







Abstract
A simplified and appealing strategy via a chiral catalyst to facilitate the electrochemical process and provide asymmetric induction of radical reactions is particularly desirable and would have potential applications in electrosynthesis, organic chemistry, and drug discovery. Here, we introduced a novel electrolytic system that diverts the standard ionic reactivity to new catalytic functions, enabling mechanistically distinct single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;based enantioselective routes to exhibit a brand&#8208;new pattern of reactivity&#8212;electricity&#8208;driven asymmetric catalysis as a privileged chiral platform for enantioselective radical allylation. The nickel&#8208;catalyzed activation of nucleophiles triggered a single&#8208;electron transfer process to provide a chiral catalyst&#8208;bound radical cation intermediate, which could be applied as an alternative strategy for the development of stereocontrolled radical reactions.

         <title>The Heaviest Bottleable Metallylone: Synthesis of a Monatomic, Zero&#8208;Valent Lead Complex (&#8220;Plumbylone&#8221;)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive plumbylone {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0} stabilized by a bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0Fe(CO)4} are reported. The latter can insert the PbFe(CO)4 moiety into a Rh&#8722;Cl bond to give a RhPbClFe(CO)4 complex.







Abstract
The elusive plumbylone {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0} 3 stabilized by the bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand 1, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0Fe(CO)4} 4 are reported. The compounds 3 and 4 were obtained stepwise via reduction of the lead(II) dibromide complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]PbBr2} 2, prepared from the bis(silylene)xanthene 1 and PbBr2, employing potassium naphthalenide and K2Fe(CO)4, respectively. While the genuine plumbylone 3 is rather labile even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, its Pb0&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complex 4 turned out to be relatively stable and bottleable. However, solutions of 4 decompose readily to elemental Pb and {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Fe(CO)3} 5 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Reaction of 4 with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 leads to the formation of the unusual dimeric [(OC)2RhPb(Cl)Fe(CO)4] complex 6 with trimetallic Rh&#8722;Pb&#8722;Fe bonds. The molecular and electronic structures of 3 and 4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen as New Anchoring Sites of Iron Single Atoms to Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the specific structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an atomic Fe catalyst anchored by sp&#8208;N was designed and synthesized, which tailored the electronic structure of Fe and thus changed the binding energy between Fe centers and intermediate species in the ORR process. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY) exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance and achieved long&#8208;term stability in the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery.







Abstract
Carbon supported single&#8208;atom catalysts with metal&#8208;Nx configuration are considered as one of the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, most of the metal&#8208;Nx active sites are composed by pyridinic N at the defect locations of graphene&#8208;like supports. Here, we employ graphdiyne (GDY) as a new carbon substrate to synthesize an iron (Fe) single atom catalyst (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY), showing excellent catalytic performance. Benefitting from the abundant acetylenic bonds in GDY, sp&#8208;N anchored metal atoms are created without forming defects. The sp&#8208;N and OH ligands regulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms and optimize the adsorption energy of ORR intermediates on the active sites by reducing the electron local density of Fe atoms, which accelerates the reaction kinetics and promotes the ORR activity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY. Furthermore, the practical application of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY is corroborated by its high power density and long&#8208;term performance via assembling a zinc&#8211;air battery.

         <title>Formation of NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Na Anode through Additive&#8208;Induced Anion&#8208;Enriched Structure of Na+ Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the anion&#8208;enriched effect induced by 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;APD) additive, more PF6&#8722; could enter the inner Na+ solvation sheath to be decomposed into NaF on the Na anode surface, which could effectively repress the Na dendrite growth and boost the cycling performance of Na&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity sodium (Na) anodes suffer from dendrite growth due to the high reactivity, which can be overcome through inducing a stable NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose an additive strategy for realizing the anion&#8208;enriched structure of Na+ solvation to obtain a NaF&#8208;rich SEI. The electron&#8208;withdrawing acetyl group in 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;APD) increases the coordination number of PF6&#8722; in the Na+ solvation sheath to facilitate PF6&#8722; to decompose into NaF. Thus, the NaF&#8208;rich SEI with high mechanical stability and interfacial energy is formed to repress the growth of Na dendrites. With the 4&#8208;APD&#8208;contained electrolyte, the symmetric Na||Na cells show excellent cycling performance over 360&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, excellent stability is also achieved for Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cells with high Coulombic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and capacity retention (91&#8201;%) after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Evidence for C&#8722;F Bond Formation through Formal Reductive Elimination from Tellurium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 38, September 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of both sp2 and sp3 C&#8722;F bond formation through formal reductive elimination from organotellurium(VI) compounds in superacidic media are provided and discussed herein. Additionally, density functional theory calculations shed light on the mechanisms of these unique reductive elimination processes and suggest that SbF5 plays an important role beyond fluoride abstraction.







Abstract
The fundamental challenge of C&#8722;F bond formation by reductive elimination has been met by compounds of select transition metals and fewer main group elements. The work detailed herein expands the list of main group elements known to be capable of reductively eliminating a C&#8722;F bond to include tellurium. Surprising and novel modes of both sp2 and sp3 C&#8722;F bond formation were observed alongside formation of TeIV cations during two separate attempts to synthesize/characterize fluorinated organotellurium(VI) cations in superacidic media (SbF5/SO2ClF). Following detailed low&#8208;temperature NMR experiments, the mechanisms of the two unique reductive elimination reactions were probed and investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Ultimately, we found that an &#8220;indirect&#8221; reductive elimination pathway is likely operative whereby Sb plays a key role in fluoride abstraction and C&#8722;F bond formation, as opposed to unimolecular reductive elimination from a discrete TeVI cation.

         <title>Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, Molecular Recognition and Chirality Sensing of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Naphthotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes have been successfully developed. The three&#8208;membered naphthotubes possess a rigid and well&#8208;defined cavity, while four&#8208;membered naphthotubes possess a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. They show quite strong binding affinities (up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1) to organic cations and can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations.







Abstract
Macrocyclic hosts with a well&#8208;defined cavity are particularly appealing for supramolecular chemistry, but they are still rare. In this research, we reported a new class of macrocyclic hosts, namely methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes, with well&#8208;defined cavities. They were synthesized through TFA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions between alkoxy&#8208;substituted bisnaphthalenes and paraformaldehyde. A configurational selection was observed. Three&#8208;membered macrocycles possess a single cavity, while four&#8208;membered macrocycles adopt a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. The small homologue shows quite strong binding affinities (up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1) to organic cations, which is better than structurally similar but flexible macrocycles. This demonstrates the advantage of a well&#8208;defined cavity in molecular recognition. Moreover, these naphthotubes can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations through different chirality transfer mechanisms.

         <title>Rechargeable LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2||Graphite Batteries Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational electrolyte design to exploit the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation strategy, the low&#8208;temperature charge&#8211;discharge performance of the graphite anode is greatly boosted, which enables the LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2||graphite batteries to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and maintain 58.3&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The rechargeability of contemporary lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is challenging at low temperatures, mainly due to the hurdles faced by graphite anodes. Herein, by exploiting the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite, its low&#8208;temperature rechargeability is boosted. Experimental characterizations aided by theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co&#8208;intercalation process is featured by low interfacial resistance with a small charge transfer activation energy (0.23&#8197;eV&#8201;atom&#8722;1) and an extremely low diffusion energy barrier (0.09&#8197;eV&#8201;atom&#8722;1) which leads to nearly temperature&#8208;independent diffusion coefficients of the solvated Li&#8208;ion in graphite, enabling graphite to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with 73.7&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Consequently, the full&#8208;cell consisting of a LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2 cathode and a graphite anode shows impressive rechargeability under &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides an alternative approach to develop low&#8208;temperature rechargeable LIBs.

         <title>A Hybrid Antiperovskite with Strong Linear and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid halide antiperovskite Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) could not only double the frequency of incident ray with very strong SHG response but also divide an incident ray into polarized o ray and e ray with exceptionally large birefringence.







Abstract
Antiperovskites have been studied since the 1980s because of their rich physical and chemical properties, but their linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses remain largely unknown. Here we report a new polar crystal, Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) (I), which features a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional antiperovskite structure composed of ClCs6 polyhedra and A&#8208;site [HC3N3S3]2&#8722; rings. To our best knowledge, this kind of antiperovskite structure is reported for the first time. Remarkably, I exhibits a very strong nonlinear optical response up to 11.4 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4 and exceptionally large birefringence of 0.52. The first&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that [HC3N3S3]2&#8722; is the &#8220;material gene&#8221; while the antiperovskite structural feature making it in a favorable arrangement. This work provides a new structural platform for the rational design of integrated optoelectronic materials with linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses.

         <title>Efficient Photoreduction of Diluted CO2 to Tunable Syngas by Ni&#8722;Co Dual Sites through d&#8208;band Center Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding strength of *CO and *H can be collectively regulated through d&#8208;band center manipulation over Ni&#8722;Co dual sites, enabling the kinetic controls of both the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution processes. The as&#8208;obtained Ni doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets exhibit superior activity and controllable selectivity in the photoconversion of diluted CO2 to syngas under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising way to address the energy and environmental challenges. Here we report the integration of Ni&#8722;Co dual sites on Ni doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets assembled double&#8208;hollow nanotube (Ni&#8722;Co3O4 NSDHN) for efficient photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. Quasi in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the declining of d&#8208;band center of Ni&#8722;Co dual sites enables the electrons accumulation in the dxz/dyz&#8208;2&#960;* and dz2&#8208;5&#963; orbitals. As a result, the binding strength of *CO is weakened and the *H adsorption site is modulated from metal sites to an oxygen site. Remarkably, Ni&#8722;Co3O4 NSDHN exhibits superior diluted CO2 photoconversion activity and controllable selectivity under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight. A syngas evolution rate of 170.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.7&#8201;% and continuously adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 to 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 are achieved.

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluoroallyl Sulfonium Salts: Practical and Bench&#8208;Stable Reagents for Highly Regioselective gem&#8208;Difluoroallylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of bench&#8208;stable yet highly reactive fluoroalkylating reagents, 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salts (DFASs), has been developed. The reaction of DFASs with aromatic and aliphatic zinc reagents via copper catalysis provides general and practical access to a wide range of versatile gem&#8208;difluoroallylated compounds with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules has important applications in producing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the general and efficient methods that can construct both C(sp2)&#8722;CF2R and C(sp3)&#8722;CF2R bonds remain challenging. Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench&#8208;stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.

The reaction of DFASs with aromatic and aliphatic zinc reagents via copper catalysis provides general and practical access to a wide range of versatile gem-difluoroallylated compounds with high regioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site-selective introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules has important applications in producing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the general and efficient methods that can construct both C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R bonds remain challenging. Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench-stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3-difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3-trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on a sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) were dramatically improved by a gradient heating synthetic strategy. The new framework material displayed a superior hydrogen evolution activity of over 100&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. In this study, we have implemented a gradient heating strategy to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;JLU100, exhibiting high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and carrier mobility for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Pt&#8208;doped COF&#8208;JLU100 demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution rate of over 100&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm). Experimental and theoretical studies corroborate that the cyano&#8208;vinylene segments in COF&#8208;JLU100 extend the &#960;&#8208;delocalization and enable fast charge transfer and separation rates as well as good dispersion in water. Moreover, COF&#8208;JLU100 can be prepared by low&#8208;cost and easily available monomers and has excellent stability, which is desirable for practical solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Selenium and Tellurium Compounds using a Thermally Stable Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salt Accessible from SF6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SF5&#8722; salt containing a chemically inert phosphonium ion proved to be a powerful oxidative fluorination reagent for the generation of fluorinated selenium and tellurium anions, derived from the elements or the diphenyl dichalcogenides. The new anions PhSeF4&#8722;, PhTeF4&#8722; and PhTeF4O&#8722; were synthesized and characterized. Alkylation of the latter provides access to trans&#8208;PhTeF4OR, a new class of fluorinated building blocks.







Abstract
Fluorinated group 16 moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but only few synthetic methods are available to prepare them. Herein, we report a new oxidative fluorination reagent capable of stabilizing reactive fluorinated anions. It consists of an SF5&#8722; anion and a chemically inert phosphonium cation and is exceptionally thermally stable. Accordingly, it was used to generate the SeF5&#8722; and TeF5&#8722; anions from the elemental chalcogens and to prepare the unknown tetrafluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;selenate PhSeF4&#8722; and &#8208;tellurate PhTeF4&#8722; from the corresponding diphenyl dichalcogenides. In addition, we show that further derivatization of [PhTeF4]&#8722; by oxidation to trans&#8208;PhTeF4O&#8722; and subsequent alkylation gives access to a new class of trans&#8208;(alkoxy)(phenyl)tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;tellanes (trans&#8208;PhTeF4OR), thus providing an approach to introduce the functional group into organic molecules.

         <title>Flexible Single&#8208;Chain&#8208;Heteropolymer&#8208;Derived Transmembrane Ion Channels with High K+ Selectivity and Tunable pH&#8208;Gated Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymer (RHP)&#8208;based artificial transmembrane ion channels were prepared via facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization. K+ could be preferably recognized and transported through the nanopores formed by the aligned crown ethers on RHPs. Through simple modification, the RHP&#8208;derived potassium channels manifested satisfactory membrane compatibility, high K+ selectivity, and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors.







Abstract
A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymer (RHP)&#8208;derived artificial ion channels with both high K+ selectivity and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors were fabricated by a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization method. The benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moieties appended on lateral chains of RHPs can form ion&#8208;permeable nanopores and transport K+ over Na+ through the lipid bilayers. The ion permeation selectivity was significantly enhanced by incorporating a cholesterol group to serve as a membrane anchor. Interestingly, similar to natural gated protein channels, on&#8211;off switchable characteristics were also realized by integrating an additional acid&#8208;sensitive alkylamine group into the RHP&#8208;derived channel. The unique design strategies have endowed the RHP&#8208;derived ion channels with facile synthetic procedures, desirable membrane compatibility, high K+ selectivity, and tunable pH&#8208;gated properties. This work provides an entry point for future design of novel functional nanochannels.

         <title>Torsional Strain&#8208;Independent Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides is reported. Under auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, both tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls were obtained in high yields and enantioselectivities. These products could be converted to bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies provided key insights into the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile bridged biaryls is emerging as a powerful strategy for atropisomer synthesis. However, the reported examples suffer from an inherent challenge as the reactivity is highly dependent on the torsional strain of the biaryl substrates, which significantly narrows down the scope and hampers the application. Herein, we report our discovery and development of a torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides. By employing auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, a universal synthesis of both tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted thiazole&#8208;containing biaryls was realized in high yields with high enantioselectivities. In addition, these products could be facilely converted to a novel type of bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.

         <title>Hydrophobicity Directed Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: Diacetylene&#8208;Cored Pseudopeptide Chiral Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer psuedopeptides with rigid dialkyne core showed hydrophobically driven chiral self&#8208;assembly with AIE. They self&#8208;assembled to vesicles in acetonitrile, while supramolecular helices in 90&#8201;% H2O/DMSO. These self&#8208;assembling pseudopeptides devoid of LC property, act as chiral dopants that direct the non&#8208;chiral LC matrix into helical assembly.







Abstract
Here we delineate simple and tunable hydrophobically driven chiral functional assemblies of diacetylene cored pseudopeptides. These amino acid appended, rigid core dialkynes constitute promising chiral supramolecular building blocks for materials properties engineering. The chiral appended amino acid elements allow for simple tuning of solubility and interaction properties as well as governing chirality, while the central dialkyne core can impart hydrophobically driven assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The self&#8208;assembly of these rod&#8208;like dialkynes can be regulated by tuning the solvent environment, with for example self&#8208;assembly into vesicles in acetonitrile and into helical organization with AIE in a H2O/DMSO mixture. Of additional high interest, these supramolecular materials, themselves devoid of liquid crystal (LC) properties, can induce chirality into non&#8208;chiral LC matrices with high helical twisting power.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Reforming of Polyol&#8208;based Biomass into CO and H2 over Nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reforming of biopolyols to produce CO and H2 at room temperature in aqueous solution is achieved via a photoelectrochemical system by using nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 photoanode and platinum cathode. Nitrogen doping induces asymmetric distribution of charge of WO3 and thus builts an internal electric field, which effectively improves the photocarrier separation.







Abstract
CO and H2 evolution from renewable and abundant biomass represent a sustainable way, but is challenged to be produced under mild conditions. Herein, we propose to produce CO and H2 from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N&#8208;WO3) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H+, and platinum cathode reduces H+ to H2, achieving CO evolution rate of 45&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (&gt;75&#8201;% gas selectivity) and H2 evolution rate of 237&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with purity &gt;99.99&#8201;% from glycerol. The nitrogen doping induces structure polarity of WO3 photoanode, leading to the formation of an internal electric field which promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charges and improves PEC efficiency. A wide range of biopolyols, such as ethylene glycol, xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and inulin were effectively converted into CO and H2. This work provides a promising method to produce highly pure H2 together with CO from biomass.

         <title>An Organo&#8208;Palladium Host Built from a Dynamic Macrocyclic Ligand: Adaptive Self&#8208;Assembly, Induced&#8208;Fit Guest Binding, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Induced&#8208;fit self&#8208;assembly using a pyridinium&#8208;based dynamic macrocyclic ligand gives rise to a new water&#8208;soluble adaptive organo&#8208;palladium host. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both an electron&#8208;rich W10O324&#8722; cluster and toluene derivatives within the redox&#8208;active host facilitates efficient and selective C&#8722;H photooxidation under mild conditions.







Abstract
Artificial hosts with rich conformational dynamics are attractive to supramolecular chemists due to their adaptive guest&#8208;binding properties and enzyme&#8208;like catalytic functions. We report here the adaptive self&#8208;assembly and host&#8208;guest catalysis of a new water&#8208;soluble organo&#8208;palladium host (Pd2L2) built from a pyridinium&#8208;bonded macrocyclic ligand (L) and cis&#8208;blocked palladium corners (Pd). While the direct self&#8208;assembly of L with Pd gives rise to a dynamic mixture of products, both neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbons and an anionic polyoxometalate cluster (W10O324&#8722;) can template the dominant formation of the Pd2L2 host. Guest&#8208;adaptive conformational changes and induced&#8208;fit cavity deformation of the Pd2L2 host have been clearly observed in the crystal structures. Moreover, the installation of the electron&#8208;rich W10O324&#8722; cluster within the cationic redox&#8208;active host (W10O32&#8834;Pd2L2) facilitates the efficient and selective C&#8722;H photooxidation of toluene derivatives to aldehyde products under mild conditions, thus representing an ideal platform for green supramolecular catalysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Assisted Reversible Migratory Coupling of Aminoborane at Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare case of dynamic migratory insertion of unsaturated species in normal valent s&#8208;block chemistry has been observed at magnesium bis(amidoboranes). The process is facilitated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, and is fundamentally a dynamic acid/base exchange between aminoborane (Me2N=BH2) and Lewis acidic magnesium species.







Abstract
A combined synthetic and theoretical investigation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of magnesium amidoboranes is presented, which involves a rare example of reversible migratory insertion within a normal valent s&#8208;block element. The reaction of (NHC)Mg(N(SiMe3)2)2 (1) and dimethylamine borane yields the tris(amide) adduct (NHC&#8722;BN)Mg(NMe2BH3)(N(SiMe3)2) (2; NHC&#8722;BN = NHC&#8722;BH2NMe2). In addition to Me2N=BH2 capture at the NHCC&#8722;Mg bond, mechanistic investigations suggest the likelihood of aminoborane migratory insertion from an RMg(NMe2BH2NMe2BH3) intermediate. To elucidate these processes, the carbene complexes (NHC)Mg(NMe2BH3)2 (8) and (NHC)Mg(NMe2BH2NMe2BH3)2 (9) were synthesized, and a dynamic migration of Me2N=BH2 between Mg&#8722;N and NHCC&#8722;Mg bonds was observed in 9. This unusual reversible migratory insertion is presumably induced by dissimilar charge localization in the &#8722;{NMe2BH2NMe2BH3} anion, as well as the capacity of NHCs to reversibly capture Me2N=BH2 in the presence of Lewis acidic magnesium species.

         <title>Double Confinement Hydrogel Network Enables Continuously Regenerative Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;confinement&#8208;cavity engineering strategy is developed for fabrication of hydrogel photocatalyst toward water splitting. The size&#8208;confinement effect as well as reversible metal coordination enable the resultant hydrogel network with excellent performance in the photocatalytic H2 production and NIR&#8208;regenerable behavior.







Abstract
Soft matter catalyst system allowing controllable manipulation of the organized nanostructure and surface property holds the potential for renewable energy. Here we demonstrate the construction of a continuously regenerative hydrogel photocatalyst that confines the metal&#8208;thiolate coordination induced nanocavity into robust micro&#8208;sized spongy network for water splitting. Thanks to low vaporization enthalpy and fast proton mobility of water molecules confining in nanocavities, the composite delivers outstanding photocatalytic H2 production (TOF of 4568&#8197;H2&#8201;h&#8722;1), nearly 4.5&#8197;times higher than that on the catalyst without confinements. Incorporating with conductive polymers, the TOF is substantially improved to 7819&#8197;H2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Impressively, continuous regeneration is for the first time achieved with H2 production retention improved from 24&#8201;% to 72&#8201;% by regulating optically&#8208;active catalyst surfaces. This optical regeneration method provides new avenues for sustainable solar energy conversion.

         <title>Surface Boron Modulation on Cobalt Oxide Nanocrystals for Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Co&#8722;B oxides with tunable morphology and textural parameters are synthesized via a facile precipitation and post calcination method. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ pair distribution function support formation of amorphous B2O3 and crystalline Co3O4 within the composite material. The synergy between boron and cobalt enhances significantly OER performance of the electrocatalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we show that coupling boron with cobalt oxide tunes its structure and significantly boost its electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through a simple precipitation and thermal treatment process, a series of Co&#8722;B oxides with tunable morphologies and textural parameters were prepared. Detailed structural analysis supported first the formation of an disordered and partially amorphous material with nanosized Co3BO5 and/or Co2B2O6 being present on the local atomic scale. The boron modulation resulted in a superior OER reactivity by delivering a large current and an overpotential of 338&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Identical location transmission electron microscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy studies revealed alteration and surface re&#8208;construction of materials, and formation of CoO2 and (oxy)hydroxide intermediate, which were found to be highly dependent on crystallinity of the samples.

         <title>Schiff Base Mediated Dipeptide Assembly toward Nanoarchitectonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes recent strategies that exploit dynamic Schiff base reactions in combination with supramolecular chemistry to mediate dipeptide assembly toward the formation of nanoarchitectonics. These strategies generate dipeptide assembled systems with diverse structures and new emergent properties, including bioactivity as well as optoelectronic and mechanical functions, making these systems suitable for applications ranging from drug delivery and waveguiding to biocatalysis.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is fascinating because of its dual nature. It perfectly combines the reversible nature of noncovalent bonds with the robustness of covalent bonds, effectively enhancing the stability of assemblies and meanwhile giving rise to unprecedented properties. Therefore, integration of DCC with supramolecular chemistry has emerged as a versatile and an extraordinarily useful approach in directing peptide assembly. This Minireview focuses on a recent strategy, which exploits dynamic Schiff base chemistry in combination with supramolecular chemistry, to mediate dipeptide assembly toward nanoarchitectonics. Diversified structures, new emergent properties, and their related applications are highlighted. Lastly, the opportunities and prospects in this exciting field are also introduced.

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to synthesize monolithic single atom electrodes. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution and nitrate reduction performances. The scalability and bifunctionality of Ru single atom electrode highlight its great potential of electrochemical applications.







Abstract
Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2&#215;2&#8197;cm to 25&#215;15&#8197;cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hydrazides by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was performed using one&#8208;pot sequential catalysis based on the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by phase&#8208;transfer N&#8208;alkylation. Chiral hydrazides were obtained with high yields and stereocontrol using commercially available reagents and catalysts. The permutation of catalysts allowed for a stereodivergent approach to a new class of atropisomers.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was achieved using a sequential catalysis protocol. This strategy is based on a one&#8208;pot sequence of two organocatalytic cycles featuring the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by nitrogen alkylation under phase&#8208;transfer conditions. The resulting axially chiral hydrazides were obtained directly from commercially available reagents in high yields and with good stereocontrol. The permutation of organocatalysts allowed easy access to all stereoisomers, enabling a stereodivergent approach to enantioenriched atropisomeric hydrazides.

         <title>Biocatalytic Depletion of Tumorigenic Energy Sources Driven by Cascade Reactions for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalytic system based on the co&#8208;delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx), and catalase (CAT) using a fluorinated polymer was developed for efficient antitumor starvation therapy through simultaneous glucose/lactate depletion under continuous O2 supply and guided by photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Glucose and lactate play important roles for tumor growth. How to simultaneously deprive tumors of glucose and lactate is a big challenge. We have developed a cascade catalytic system (denoted as FPGLC) based on fluorinated polymer (FP) with co&#8208;loading of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx), and catalase (CAT). GOx and LOx deprive glucose and lactate, respectively, resulting in abundant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Meanwhile, CAT catalyzes H2O2 into O2, which not only promotes catalytic reactions of GOx and LOx for consuming more glucose and lactate, but also alleviates tumor hypoxia. Benefiting from the excellent cross&#8208;membrane and transmucosal penetration capacities of FP, FPGLC rapidly accumulated in tumors and subsequently mediated enhanced cascade catalytic therapy under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. These results demonstrate that the dual depletion of glucose and lactate with O2 supply is a promising strategy for efficient antitumor starvation therapy.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Exposed Single&#8208;Ni Atoms with Potential&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behaviors for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trapping the active sites on the exterior surface of hollow supports can reduce mass transfer resistance and enhance atomic utilization. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize single&#8208;Ni atoms decorated hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/NFCS). Specifically, the CdS@3&#8208;aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N&#8208;FCS. The gasmigrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N&#8208;FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/NFCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 56.5 mV dec&#8722;1, and ultralong stability up to 166 hours without obvious fading. Moreover, the potential&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of Ni&#8208;N4 motifs and the contribution of the S dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a key component of batteries, the electrolyte determines the ion transport and interface chemistry of the cathode and anode. In this work, we develop a dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110 h with a high energy efficiency of 80%. The ion&#8208;crosslinked dual&#8208;network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability. This work provides significant concepts for developing novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes to realize high&#8208;performance energy devices and technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>The Continuum Between Hexagonal Planar and Trigonal Planar Geometries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New heterometallic hydride complexes that involve the addition of  {Mg&#8211;H}  and  {Zn&#8211;H}  bonds to group 10 transition metals (Pd, Pt) are reported. The side&#8208;on coordination of a single  {Mg&#8211;H}  to Pd forms a well&#8208;defined  &#963;  &#8208;complex. In contrast, addition of three  {Mg&#8211;H}  or  {Zn&#8211;H}  bonds to Pd or Pt results in the formation of planar complexes with subtly different geometries. We compare their structures through experiment (X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, multinuclear NMR), computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, NCIPlot), and theoretical analysis (MO diagram, Walsh diagram). These species can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between ideal trigonal planar and hexagonal planar geometries.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying the Influence of Covalent Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding on Differing Reactivity of Trivalent Uranium and Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Qualitative differences in the reactivity of trivalent lanthanide and actinide complexes have long been attributed to differences in covalent metal&#8208;ligand bonding, but there are few examples where thermodynamic aspects of this relationship have been quantified, especially with U  3+  and in the absence of competing variables. Here we report a series of dimeric phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent  f  &#8208;metals that show how shorter&#8208;than&#8208;expected U&#8208;B distances indicative of increased covalency give rise to measurable differences in solution deoligomerization reactivity when compared to isostructural complexes with similarly sized lanthanides. These results, which are in excellent agreement with supporting DFT and QTAIM calculations, afford rare experimental evidence concerning the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of trivalent uranium and lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8217; (eS2&#8217;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Access to 1,3&#8208;Oxazepine&#8208;Containing Bridged Biaryls via Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclosed herein an atroposelective synthesis of novel bridged biaryls containing medium&#8208;sized rings via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis. The reaction starts with addition of carbene catalysts to aminophenols&#8208;derived aldimine substrates. Subsequent oxidation and intramolecular desymmetrization lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;oxazepine&#8208;containing bridged biaryls in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This novel bridged biaryl products can be readily transformed to chiral phosphite ligands. Preliminary density function theory calculations suggest that the origin of enantioselectivity arises from the more favorable frontier molecular orbital interactions in the transition state leading to the major product.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8208;H Hydroxylation in Diiron &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylase CmlA Transpires by&#160;Amine&#8208;Assisted O2 Activation Avoiding FeIV2O2 Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through QM/MM modelings, we discover that the C(sp  3  )&#8208;H  &#946;&#8208;  hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires by a traceless amine&#8208;assisted O  2  activation. Different from the canonical diiron hydroxylase sMMO, this aliphatic amine&#8208;assisted O  2  activation avoids generating the high&#8208;valent diferryl Fe  IV  2  O  2  species, but alternatively renders a diferric Fe  III  2  O species as the reactive oxidant. From this unprecedented O  2  activation mode, the derived C(sp  3  )&#8208;H hydroxylation mechanism in CmlA also differs drastically from the toluene aromatic C(sp  2  )&#8208;H hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase T4MO. This substrate&#8208;modulated O  2  activation in CmlA has rich mechanistic implications for other diiron hydroxylases having amine group adjacent to C&#8208;H bond under hydroxylation in substrates, e.g., hDOHH. Furthermore, the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O  2  binding in CmlA, also opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities for O  2  activation in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional CdS/MoO2/MoS2 Catalyst Enhances Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and Pyruvic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO2  /MoS2  hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective  pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS2  and MoO2  are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO4  in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS2  and MoO2  function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a  two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron  route for PA production is proposed, which is initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3  )&#8211;H bond in the LA.  The conversion of LA and  the selectivity of  PA can reach  ca. 29% and 95% after a five&#8208;hour reaction, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Microscopic Origin of Second Harmonic Generation Response: The Spatial Structure of Instantaneous Dipole Moments in Electron Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A deep understanding on the crucial factors of the enhanced macroscopic second harmonic generation (SHG) in some deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is needed to design new NLO materials. Since an optical process relates to the electron excitation and polarization simultaneously, the instantaneous dipole moments and their structures in excitation should be seriously taken account to seek the principal factor in SHG response. In this work, we study the Ba  4  B  11  O  20  F (BBOF), a NLO material, by using the orbital projection technique. From the projected SHG of our theoretic calculation, we recognize the principal dipole moment of the dominant influence on SHG and the relevant atom groups between which the dipole moment is accommodated. With the conclusion that the dipole moment with the most significant influence on SHG is the one between the oxygen&#8211;boron polyhedral anion group and barium cation, we predict that Ba  4  Al  11  O  20  F (BAOF) has a comparable SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids and sulfinates provides a direct and modular access to sulfoxides by a photocatalytic process that has unveiled the unexplored chemoselective radicalophilic reactivity of intermediate sulfinyl sulfones and enabled the conjunctive coupling of two carboxylic acids, revealing broad new chemical space accessible by the merger of the two coupling partner classes of emergent synthetic importance.







Abstract
The intermediate oxidation state of sulfoxides is central to the plethora of their applications in chemistry and medicine, yet it presents challenges for an efficient synthetic access, limiting the structural diversity of currently available sulfoxides. Here, we report a data&#8208;guided development of direct decarboxylative sulfinylation that enables the previously inaccessible functional group interconversion of carboxylic acids to sulfoxides in a reaction with sulfinates. Given the broad availability of carboxylic acids and the growing synthetic potential of sulfinates, the direct decarboxylative sulfinylation is poised to improve the structural diversity of synthetically accessible sulfoxides. The reaction is facilitated by a kinetically favored sulfoxide formation from the intermediate sulfinyl sulfones, despite the strong thermodynamic preference for the sulfone formation, unveiling the previously unknown and chemoselective radicalophilic sulfinyl sulfone reactivity.

         <title>[Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722;: A Powerful Difluoromethylating Reagent Inspired by Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; that was able to difluoromethylate a variety of aryl and alkyl electrophiles was developed. In the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 also reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[Cu(Cl2)]&#8722; and [(DPPF)Pd(Cl)2].







Abstract
The quest of the active species in copper&#8208;mediated difluoromethylation of aryl halides led to the discovery of a powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; 2. Complex 2 was able to difluoromethylate a variety of electrophiles including electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides, heteroaryl iodides, activated heteroaryl bromides, chloride and aryl bromides with a directing group, as well as other electrophiles such as alkenyl iodide, benzyl bromides, allyl bromides, alkyl iodide, allyl carbonates and acid chloride. In addition, in the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[CuCl2]&#8722; and [(DPPF)PdCl2].

         <title>3D Blockage Mapping for Identifying Familial Point Mutations in Single Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides with a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate discrimination of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides containing familial point mutations would advance the knowledge of their roles in early&#8208;onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Herein, we simultaneously identified the mutant A21G, E22G, E22Q, and the wild&#8208;type (WT) A&#946;  18&#8208;26  peptides with aerolysin nanopore using a 3D blockage mapping strategy. The standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (  &#963;  b  ) was proposed as a new supplement to current blockage (  I  b  /  I  0  ) and duration time (  t  D  ) to profile the blockage characteristics of single molecules. Although the WT and A21G A&#946;  18&#8208;26  are indistinguishable in a traditional  I  b  /  I  0  &#8208;  t  D  2D description, ~87% of the blockade events can be accurately classified with half reduction of false identification using a combination of  I  b  /  I  0  ,  t  D,  and  &#963;  b  . This work offers an easy and reliable strategy to promote nanopore sensitivity of peptide mutants, leading to a more precise analysis of pathogenic mutations for developing effective diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Complex Chirality Evolution in DNA&#8208;Assembled High&#8208;Order, Hybrid Chiroplasmonic Superstructures from Multi&#8208;Scale Chirality Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical, chiral hybrid superstructures of chromophores and nanoparticles are expected to give rise to intriguing unveiled chiroptical responses originating from the complex chiral interactions among the components. Herein, DNA origami cavity that could self&#8208;assemble into one&#8208;dimensional (1D) DNA tubes was employed as a scaffold to accurately organize metal nanoparticles and chromophores. The chiral interactions were studied at the level of individual hybrid particles and their 1D hybrid superstructures. Complex chirality mechanisms involving global structural chirality, plasmon&#8208;induced circular dichroism (PICD) and exciton&#8208;coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) were disentangled. The multiplexed CD spectrum superposition revealed the chirality evolution at different length scales. These results can offer a model for boosting the theoretical understanding of classical&#8208;quantum hybrid systems, and would inspire the future design of optically&#8208;active substances across length scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Atoms/Clusters on Ni&#8208;phytate&#8208;sensitized Carbon Nitride for Enhanced NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven Overall Water Splitting beyond 800 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven overall water splitting beyond 800 nm remains a high&#8208;priority target yet great challenge. Here we report that efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons in a photosensitized system prepared by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The optimal catalyst presents simultaneous hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution with an H2 evolution amount of 1.4 &#956;mol at &#955; &gt; 800 nm for 24 hours, which its activity was approximately 140 times higher than that of a system without Pt&#8208;SAC modification (PA&#8208;Ni1.1@PCN). This work represents the first NIR&#8208;light responsive photosensitized system for overall water splitting, and may open an avenue for precisely manipulating cocatalyst positions at the atomic level to improve NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting via photosensitization.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Access to Vicinal Diamines by Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitized Amidylimination of Alkenes with Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2&#8208;diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different  N  &#8208;centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diamine&#8208;containing complex molecule scaffolds.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A metal-free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2-diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet-triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long-lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different  N  -centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity-oriented synthesis of 1,2-diamine-containing complex molecule scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 Stabilized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium Catalyst for Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of effective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol remains a challenge. Herein, we report that Rh1/CeTiOx single&#8208;atom catalyst constructed by embedding monoatomic Rh onto Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 support has shown a super high ethanol selectivity (~99.1%), record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency (493.1 h&#8208;1), and outstanding stability. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doption and monoatomic Rh contribute to this excellent catalytic performance by firstly facilitating oxygen vacancies formation to generate oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;Rh Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;base pairs, which favor CO2 adsorption and activation, cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds in CHxOH* and COOH* into CHx* and CO* species, subsequent C&#8208;C coupling and hydrogenation into ethanol, and secondly generating strong Rh&#8208;O bond by Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction, which contributes to striking stability. This work stresses the importance of support elaborating regulation for single&#8208;atom catalyst design to improve the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Square Planar Cu4 Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polynuclear reaction sites catalyze some of the most challenging transformations in chemistry. Programmatic assembly of atomically&#8208;precise cluster compounds is challenging. Here we describe the synthesis of supramolecular ligands designed to nucleate well&#8208;defined square planar tetranuclear copper clusters, establishing metal&#8208;metal interactions capable of delocalizing oxidation stress across the cluster.







Abstract
Template&#8208;assisted synthesis of well&#8208;defined polynuclear clusters remains a challenge for [M4] square planar topologies. Herein, we present a tetraamine scaffold RL(NH2)4, where L is a rigidified resorcin[4]arene, to direct the formation of C4&#8208;symmetric RL(NH)4Cu4 clusters with Cu&#8722;Cu distances around 2.7&#8197;&#197;, suggesting metal&#8208;metal direct interactions are operative since the sum of copper's van der Waals radii is 2.8&#8197;&#197;. DFT calculations display HOMO to HOMO&#8208;3 residing all within a 0.1&#8197;eV gap. These four orbitals display significant electron density contribution from the Cu centers suggesting a delocalized electronic structure. The one&#8208;electron oxidized [Cu4]+ species was probed by variable temperature X&#8208;band continuous wave&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance (CW&#8208;EPR), which displays a multiline spectrum at room temperature. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for [M4] clusters and a new platform to investigate activation of small molecules.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Quenchers for F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Structure, Mechanism, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we focus on the quenching mechanisms, types, and biomedical applications of these quenchers. We give an in&#8208;depth discussion of their structure&#8211;property relationship and discuss the potentials and challenges of the quenchers in biomedical applications.







Abstract
For fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, and are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small&#8208;molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This Review is intended to provide suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8211;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, as a proof of concept we report that guest adsorption selectivity in nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor postsynthetic modification method. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest are the major factors in determining the guest selectivity.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone EtP4Q1 show negligible selectivity for C5 hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto EtP4Q1 NACs does not improve the selectivity, while EtP4Q1 NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of n&#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8211;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.

         <title>Energy Transfer Chemiluminescent Spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Probes for Bioanalyte Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy transfer from chemiluminescent spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffolds to dyes in the proximity allows signal amplification while affording luminescence in the biologically relevant red/near infrared region. Strategies to promote such donor&#8211;acceptor interactions include polymeric entrapment, host&#8211;guest encapsulation, and direct tethering of organic and inorganic fluorophores.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging of bioanalytes using spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes has gained significant attention due to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and imaging depth compared to excitation&#8208;based probes, as well as their modifiable scaffolds that offer analyte&#8208;specific responses and tunable emissive properties. Among several strategies employed to amplify signals under aqueous conditions and to shift the emission into the bio&#8208;relevant red region, energy transfer to an adjacent fluorophore is a popular and effective method. This Minireview highlights spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based probes that operate via an energy transfer mechanism to detect bioanalytes both in vitro and in vivo. Probes that display both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions with fluorophores, as well as their applications in imaging specific analytes will be discussed.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage derivatization was used to construct azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides through a radical azidation/heterocyclization cascade. This electrochemical oxidative strategy could be conducted under mild, efficient, and environmentally friendly conditions in buffer solution.







Abstract
As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing a Trp side chain through manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerance, high site selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87&#8201;%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing an azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives, such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Poor Alkenes and Dienes Enabled by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydride Addition/Protonolysis Mechanism
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos in methanol catalyzes the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor dienes and related substrates at low metal loadings via a hydride addition/Rh&#8208;enolate protonation pathway.







Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes is a well&#8208;developed technology used on lab scale as well as on large scales in the chemical industry. Site&#8208; and chemoselective mono&#8208;hydrogenations of polarized conjugated dienes remain challenging. Instead, stoichiometric main&#8208;group hydrides are used rather than H2. As part of an effort to develop a scalable route to prepare geranylacetone, we discovered that Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos based catalysts enable the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes, enones, and other polyunsaturated substrates. D&#8208;labeling and DFT studies support a mechanism where a nucleophilic RhI&#8208;hydride selectively adds to electron&#8208;poor alkenes and the resulting Rh&#8208;enolate undergoes subsequent inner&#8208;sphere protonation by alcohol solvent. The finding that (Ln)Rh(H)(CO) type catalysts can enable selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes provides a valuable tool in the design of related chemoselective hydrogenation processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Carboxylation of Organic Halides in the Presence of Catalytic Amounts of an Organomediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and metal&#8208;free method for the electroreductive carboxylation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds has been developed to obtain carboxylated compounds in the presence of catalytic amounts of naphthalene as a mediator. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, and is shown to be a powerful approach for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X=Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylations of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds via single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral molecules are transported along a pre&#8208;defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl&#8208;rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction&#8208;diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non&#8208;polar molecule pyrene.







Abstract
Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60&#8208;fold within 4&#8197;hours. To accelerate transport kinetics, a dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) is utilized. Here, the non&#8208;polar dye pyrene was transported. The dynamic gradient is generated by an ion exchange process triggered by the localized introduction of an aqueous NaCl solution, which converts the gel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front. The dynamic gradient provides about 10&#8208;fold faster transport kinetics than the static gradient.

         <title>Megalo&#8208;Cavitands: Synthesis of Acridane[4]arenes and Formation of Large, Deep Cavitands for Selective C70 Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), synthesized in only six steps, has been shown to be suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C70.







Abstract
Deep cavitands, concave molecular containers, represent an important supramolecular host class that has been explored for a variety of applications ranging from sensing, switching, purification and adsorption to catalysis. A major limitation in the field has been the cavitand volume that is restricted by the size of the structural platform utilized (diameter approx. 7&#8197;&#197;). We here report the synthesis of a novel, unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with mM to sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C60 and C70. Furthermore, the selective binding of fullerene C70 in the presence of C60 was demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) from binary to high&#8208;entropy was fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. When used as sulfur hosts, high&#8208;entropy PBA can act as polysulfide immobilizers and catalysts to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Moreover, metal oxides derived from high&#8208;entropy PBA possess good electronic properties, which can prompt the further research of high&#8208;entropy PBA derivatives.







Abstract
The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials. Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate that high&#8208;entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance. Additionally, a variety of nanocubic metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our coprecipitation and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryldifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with Aryldifluoromethyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes is shown to form diaryl difluoromethanes. A simple dialkyl(dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand for palladium, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;interactions between palladium and the difluorobenzyl ligand during reductive elimination, and a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes enabled the reaction to form diverse products, including those possessing biological activities.







Abstract
Diaryl difluoromethanes are valuable targets for medicinal chemistry because they are bioisosteres of diaryl ethers and can function as replacements for diaryl methane, ketone, and sulfone groups. However, methods to prepare diaryl difluoromethanes are scarce, especially methods starting from abundant aryl halides. We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryldifluoromethylation of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes (TMSCF2Ar). The reaction occurs when the catalyst contains a simple, but unusual, dialkylaryl phosphine ligand that promotes transmetallation of the silane. Computational studies show that reductive elimination following transmetallation occurs with a low barrier, despite the fluorine atoms on the &#945;&#8208;carbon, due to coordination of the difluorobenzyl &#960;&#8208;system to palladium. The co&#8208;development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes broadened the scope of the process including several applications to the synthesis biologically relevant diaryl difluoromethanes.
