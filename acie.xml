         <title>Chromophore&#8208;inspired Design of Pyridinium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Polymers for Dual Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium (TPT+) functioned as a classic organic photocatalyst exhibits a noteworthy absorption in the visible range, strongly oxidizing excited states, and a somewhat unstable structure. Inspired by the nuclear chromophore and dual catalysis strategy, herein, we report a universal photoredox platform constructed by TPT+&#8208;mimic bridging ligands and reductive metal ions on the basis of metal&#8208;organic supramolecular systems for various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation under visible light irradiation. Significant photoinduced electron transfer and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer events are both integrated and regulated by the spatial and kinetic confinement effects of the structurally confined microenvironments, effectively improving the efficiency of electron transfer and radical&#8208;radical coupling processes in photocatalysis. This package deal paves a promising way for designing novel photocatalysts and developing versatile and sustainable synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Interphase Chemistry to Stabilize High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode Material via Spinel Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) are critical to cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage cathodes for batteries, yet their formation mechanism and properties remain elusive. Here we report that the compositions of CEI are largely controlled by abundant species in inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and can be tuned from material aspects. The IHL of LiCoO2 (LCO) was found to alter after charging, with solvent&#8208;rich environment that results in fragile organic&#8208;rich CEI. By passivated spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating, we achieve anion&#8208;rich IHL after charging, thus enabling robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI. In&#8208;situ microscopy reveals that LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains mechanical integrity at 500 &#176;C, in sharp contrast to organic&#8208;rich CEI with severe expansion and subsequent voids/cracks in cathode. As a result, the spinel&#8208;coated LCO exhibits a high specific capacity of 194 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C and a capacity retention of 83% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. Our work sheds new light on modulating CEI for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Si Sites Enabled by Negative Valent Ru for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in LaRuSi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and identification of novel active sites are paramount for deepening the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and driving the development of remarkable electrocatalysts. Here, we reveal that the genuine active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in LaRuSi are Si sites, not the usually assumed Ru sites. Ru in LaRuSi has a peculiar negative valence state, which leads to strong hydrogen binding to Ru sites. Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063 eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites   and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Straightforward Access to Multifunctional &#960;&#8208;Conjugated P&#8208;Heterocycles Featuring an Internal Ylidic Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel 5 or 6&#8208;membered P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond: P&#8208;containing acenaphthylenes and phenanthrenes. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization through direct arylation to introduce electron&#8208;rich/poor substituents and the synthetic strategy is also compatible with the preparation of more elaborated polyaromatic scaffolds such acenes and helicenes. Using a joint experimental (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical approach, we perform a full structure&#8208;property relationships study on these new platforms. In particular, we show that molecular engineering allows not only tuning their absorption/emission on the entire visible range but also endowing them with chiroptical or non&#8208;linear optical properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing aza&#8208;BODIPY: A New Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) J&#8208;aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine&#8208;containing aza&#8208;BODIPY precursor (  BDP&#8208;NH  2  ), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate (  BDP&#8208;NO  ). The introduction of  N  &#8208;nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of  BDP&#8208;NH  2  , which instead promotes the formation of J&#8208;aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of ~109 nm to the NIR window (820 nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of  BDP&#8208;NO  within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammation for the  in vivo  treatment of MRSA infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution and Single&#8208;Droplet Analysis of Fuel&#8208;Driven Compartments by Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active droplets are a great model for membraneless organelles. However, the analysis of these systems remains challenging and is often limited due to the short timescales of their kinetics. We use droplet&#8208;based microfluidics to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate droplets to overcome this challenge. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. We discovered that the fuel concentration dictates the formation of the coacervate&#8208;based droplets and their properties. We observe that coacervate&#8208;based droplets grow through fusion, decay simultaneously independent of their volume, and shrinkage rate scales with their initial volume. This method helps to further understand the regulation of membraneless organelles, and we believe the analysis of individual coacervate&#8208;based droplets enables future selection&#8208; or evolution&#8208;based studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding Multiphoton Active Units within Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Turning on High&#8208;Order Multiphoton Excited Fluorescence for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescent materials for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging has always been an intractable challenge. In this study, a reasonable strategy guided by theoretical calculations was employed to fabricate a novel high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF)&#8208;responsive UiO&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF,  ZrTc  ). Strategically, the functionalization of the photonic&#8208;responsive thiazolothiazole&#8208;based organic ligand gave rise to amplified H&#8208;MPEF (four&#8208;photon activity) performance and prolonged excitation wavelength (1550 nm) of  ZrTcI  . The results reveal that the extended &#960;&#8208;electron system, enhanced charge transfer, improved dipole moment, and weakened &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions within the MOFs endow them with excellent H&#8208;MPEF performance for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging. It is an extremely rare report on H&#8208;MPEF bioimaging using MOFs and provide a universal strategy for the fabrication of H&#8208;MPEF&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Reaction Intermediates to Predict Enantioselectivity Using Mass Spectrometry**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereomeric intermediates can be separated by ion mobility mass spectrometry. Monitoring of the kinetics of the intermediates allows the prediction of the overall reaction enantioselectivity. The experiments can be performed in a small scale and do not require an isolation of the products.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions are at the core of chemical synthesis. Their development mostly relies on prior knowledge, laborious product analysis and post&#8208;rationalization by theoretical methods. Here, we introduce a simple and fast method to determine enantioselectivities based on mass spectrometry. The method is based on ion mobility separation of diastereomeric intermediates, formed from a chiral catalyst and prochiral reactants, and delayed reactant labeling experiments to link the mass spectra with the reaction kinetics in solution. The data provide rate constants along the reaction paths for the individual diastereomeric intermediates, revealing the origins of enantioselectivity. Using the derived kinetics, the enantioselectivity of the overall reaction can be predicted. Hence, this method can offer a rapid discovery and optimization of enantioselective reactions in the future. We illustrate the method for the addition of cyclopentadiene (CP) to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde catalyzed by a diarylprolinol silyl ether.

         <title>A Lattice Matching Strategy for Highly Reversible Copper Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu) metal is an attractive anode material of aqueous rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (844 mAh g  &#8208;1  ), good environmental compatibility and high earth abundance. However, the Cu anodes often suffer from poor deposition/stripping reversibility and nonuniform deposition during the charge/discharge process, degrading the lifetime of aqueous Cu metal batteries. Herein, a lattice matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu metal anodes. In such strategy, Ni substrates that exhibit high lattice matching with Cu was selected to support the Cu anodes. The high lattice matching endows Cu anodes with high deposition/stripping reversibility, low nucleation overpotential as well as a uniform and dense electrodeposition on Ni substrates. Based on the Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes, the full cells paired with lead dioxide cathodes show a capacity retention of 99.3% after 200 charge/discharge cycles. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu electrodes in aqueous rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a bioinformatic workflow and subsequent discovery of a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase, which we named MG8, from the human saliva metagenome. MG8 has robust PET plastic degradation activities under different temperature and salinity conditions, outperforming several naturally occurring and engineered hydrolases in degrading PET. Moreover, we genetically encode 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP) in place of the catalytic serine residue of MG8, thereby converting a PET hydrolase into a covalent binder for bio&#8208;functionalization of PET. We show that MG8(DAP), in conjunction with a split green fluorescent protein system, can be used to attach protein cargos to PET as well as other polyester plastics. The discovery of a highly active PET hydrolase from the human metagenome&#8212;currently an underexplored resource for industrial enzyme discovery&#8212;as well as the repurposing of such an enzyme into a plastic functionalization tool, should facilitate ongoing efforts to degrade and maximize reusability of PET.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternative Benzoxazole Assembly Discovered in Anaerobic Bacteria Provides Access to Privileged Heterocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole scaffolds feature prominently in diverse synthetic and natural product&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals. Our understanding of their bacterial biosynthesis is, however, limited to ortho&#8208;substituted heterocycles from Actinomycetes. We report an overlooked biosynthetic pathway in anaerobic bacteria (typified in Clostridium cavendishii) that expands the benzoxazole chemical space to meta&#8208;substituted heterocycles and heralds a distribution beyond Actinobacteria. The first benzoxazoles from the anaerobic realm (closoxazole A and B) were elucidated by NMR and chemical synthesis. By genome editing in the native producer, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and systematic pathway dissection we show that closoxazole biosynthesis invokes an unprecedented precursor usage (3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate) and manner of assembly. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis of a tafamidis analogue. A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins represents a straightforward approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides, but is hampered by the necessity to employ CO gas, often at elevated pressures. We herein describe, as an alternative, an enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes leveraging dual copper hydride and palladium catalysis to enable the use of readily available carbamoyl chlorides as a practical carbamoylating reagent. The protocol is applicable to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Substrates containing a diverse range of functional groups as well as heterocyclic substructures undergo functionalization to provide  &#945;  &#8208; and  &#946;  &#8208;chiral amides in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H Arylation of Aldehydes and Ketones by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalization of ketones and aldehydes has been intensively explored in organic synthesis. The functionalization of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds in such carbonyl compounds is less well investigated and developing a general method for their &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation remains challenging. Herein we report a method that uses cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis for the formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of aldehydes and ketones with (hetero)aryl bromides. The method features mild conditions, remarkable scope and wide functional group tolerance. Importantly, the introduced synthetic strategy also allows the &#946;&#8208;alkenylation, &#946;&#8208;alkynylation and &#946;&#8208;acylation of aldehydes under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that this transformation proceeds through a single electron oxidation/Ni&#8208;mediated coupling/reductive elimination cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Stepwise Arylation of Unprotected Peptides by PtIV Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective stepwise arylation of S&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds in unprotected peptides by air&#8208; and moisture&#8208; stable PtIV complexes is reported. These compounds showed high reactivity and selectivity toward the N terminal NH2 group over other N&#8722;H bonds in complex biologically relevant substrates.







Abstract
LPtIVF(Aryl) complexes bearing a bulky bidentate 2&#8208;[bis(adamant&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phosphino]phenoxide ligand (L) demonstrate excellent reactivity and selectivity in the arylation of X&#8722;H (X=S, N) bonds of amino acid residues in unprotected peptides under mild, including aqueous, conditions. Stepwise addition of these complexes allowed a convenient one&#8208;pot introduction of different aromatic groups in the X&#8722;H bonds of Cys and N terminus. PtIV reagents can also be used to further arylate N&#8722;H bonds in Lys and Trp providing access to peptides bearing multiple aromatic groups.

         <title>Expanded Azaporphyrins Consisting of Multiple BODIPY Units: Global Aromaticity and High  Affinities Towards Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY  9  under the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination conditions gave nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer  10  , pentamer  11  , and hexamer  12  . Oxidations of  10  ,  11  , and  12  in the presence of alkali metal ions provided monopotassium complex of [38]azaoctaphyrin&#8208;(BF  2  )  4  monoanion  13  , disodium complex of [46]azadecaphyrin&#8208;(BF  2  )  5  monoanion  15  , and disodium complex of [56]azadodacaphyrin&#8208;(BF  2  )  6  dianion  16  , respectively as the first example of expanded azaporphyrin possessing more than six pyrrole units. Curiously, the oxidation even in the absence of alkali metal ion gave the same alkali metal ion complexes after the usual work&#8208;up and chromatographic separation as spontaneous and inevitable complexation. The precursors  10  &#8208;  12  showed large association constants (10  4  ~ 10  6  M  &#8208;1  ) with K  +  and Na  +  , but the spontaneous and inevitable complexations were not observed, indicating extremely high affinities of  13  &#8208;  16  toward alkali metal ions, which can be ascribed mainly to the multiple and effective ion&#8208;dipole interaction of the alkali metal ion with the negatively polarized F atoms of the BF  2  walls surrounding the cavity. Importantly,  13  ,  14  , and  15  show diatropic ring currents due to the global aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 2D Hybrid Double Perovskites on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 Crystals towards Ultrasensitive Detection of Weak Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the self&#8208;assembly of 2D double perovskite (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7&#160;  (BLA = benzylammonium) on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6  crystals, providing the first demonstration of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection using lead&#8208;free double perovskite HCs. The (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7/Cs2AgBiBr6  HC successfully combines the anisotropy of 2D double perovskites with the well&#8208;defined interface provided by heterogeneous integration. Driven by the built&#8208;in electric field in junction, photodetectors of HCs exhibit unique polarization dependence of zero&#8208;bias photocurrent with a large anisotropy ratio up to 9, which is 6 times amplified as compared to the pristine 2D (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7. More importantly, the present devices can remain polarization sensitive with incident light intensity down to nW/cm^2 level. Our study on lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskite HCs marks a step toward establishing robust material foundations for fundamental scientific investigations and the development of optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Oxazine&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probe with Changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation to Eliminate False&#8208;Positive Interference of Albumin and Its Application to Sensing Aminopeptidase N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many fluorophores/probes suffer from the interference of albumin in biosystems. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to overcome this interference by virtue of both an albumin&#8208;insensitive fluorophore and its changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and demonstrate it by designing an oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe for aminopeptidase N (APN). The modification on the N atom in the oxazine fluorophore with alanine through a cleavable linker locks the resulting probe in a non&#8208;conjugated, colorless and non&#8208;fluorescent state, so the non&#8208;specific interaction of albumin produces no spectroscopic response. APN can selectively cleave the alanine moiety, restoring the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong fluorescence. The capability of the probe to eliminate the albumin influence has been demonstrated by imaging APN in different cell lines, and by quantitatively determining APN in human serum and mouse urine. The present strategy may be useful for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.</dc:description>

Here we report that Ala  B  can serve as universal building blocks in the synthesis of a diverse collection of modified amino acids, peptides, and proteins. First, we develop the synthesis of Ala  B  from redox&#8208;active esters of aspartic acid resulting in a series of b&#8208;boronoalanine derivatives. Next, we show that Ala  B  can be integrated into automated oligopeptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Ala  B  is compatible with common transformations used in preparative peptide chemistry such as native chemical ligation and radical desulfurization as showcased by total synthesis of Ala  B  &#8208;containing ubiquitin. Furthermore, Ala  B  reagents participate in Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, including C&#8208;C cross&#8208;couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, Ala  B  synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;driven Overproduction of Biofuels in&#160;Microorganisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial cell factories reinvigorate current industries by producing complex fine chemicals at low costs.&#160;Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the main reducing power to drive the biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. However, the insufficient intrinsic NADPH limits the productivity of microorganisms. Here, we report that supplying microorganisms with long&#8208;lived electrons from persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3) can elevate the NADPH level to facilitate efficient fine chemicals production. The defects in meso&#8208;Al2O3 were demonstrated to be highly efficient in prolonging electrons&#8217; lifetime. The long&#8208;lived electrons in meso&#8208;Al2O3 can pass the material&#8208;microorganism interface and power the biosynthetic pathways of E. coli to produce jet fuel farnesene. This work represents a reliable strategy to design photo&#8208;biosynthesis systems to improve the productivity of microorganisms with solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Interfacial Stability Model with Na&#8211;K Liquid Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial stability study based on a unique multi&#8208;cation liquid Na&#8211;K alloy anode is conducted with long cycle&#8208;life and small overpotential after stabilization, revealing the decomposition model and the relationship between kinetic factors and interfacial composition in solid&#8208;state batteries. Designs based on this model can control the charge&#8208;selection process and improve the performance of a dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8211;K solid&#8208;state battery.







Abstract
In this work, the Na&#8211;K liquid alloy with a charge selective interfacial layer is developed to achieve an impressively long cycling life with small overpotential on a sodium super&#8208;ionic conductor solid&#8208;state electrolyte (NASICON SSE). With this unique multi&#8208;cation system as the platform, we further propose a unique model that contains a chemical decomposition domain and a kinetic decomposition domain for the interfacial stability model. Based on this model, two charge selection mechanisms are proposed with dynamic chemical kinetic equilibrium and electrochemical kinetics as the manners of control, respectively, and both are validated by the electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations. This study provides an effective design for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state battery with alkali Na&#8211;K anode, but also presents a novel approach to understand the interfacial chemical processes that could inspire and guide future designs.

         <title>One&#8208;For&#8208;All Polyolefin Functionalization: Active Ester as Gateway to Combine Insertion Polymerization with ROP, NMP, and RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. It allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials that comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.







Abstract
This work develops the Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process to afford well&#8208;defined polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl block copolymers. &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII&#8208;catalyzed olefin polymerizations were investigated through in&#8208;depth kinetic studies in comparison to an analog to establish the critical design that facilitates catalyst activation. Simple transformations lead to a diversity of functional groups forming polyolefin macroinitiators or macro&#8208;mediators for various subsequent controlled polymerization techniques. Preparation of block copolymers with different architectures, molecular weights, and compositions was demonstrated with ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP), and photoiniferter reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PI&#8208;RAFT). The significant difference in the properties of polyolefin&#8211;polyacrylamide block copolymers was harnessed to carry out polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and study the nanostructure behaviors.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation for a Gradient Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interphase Enables High&#8208;Rate and Stable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient inorganic&#8208;rich interphase is constructed on Na surface in a high&#8208;concentration ether&#8208;based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether. It leads to a configuration of solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters for a reinforced inner solvation sheath. The derived interphase results in a reduced energy barrier for Na+ migration and fast interfacial kinetics, and hence excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising anode for rechargeable batteries, however, it is plagued by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Na dendrites. Herein, a robust anion&#8208;derived SEI is constructed on Na anode in a high&#8208;concentration 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether, which effectively restrains Na dendrite growth. The hydrofluoroether can tune the solvation configuration of the electrolyte from three&#8208;dimensional network aggregates to solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters, enabling more anions to enter and reinforce the inner solvation sheath and their stepwise decomposition. The gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI leads to a reduced energy barrier of Na+ migration and enhanced interfacial kinetics. These render the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery with an excellent rate capability of 79.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 24&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 6000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. This highlights the modulation of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry for advanced batteries.

         <title>Unbiased C3&#8208;Electrophilic Indoles: Triflic Acid Mediated C3&#8208;Regioselective Hydroarylation of N&#8722;H Indoles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct dearomative C3&#8208;functionalization of indoles provided access to privileged scaffolds by an umpolung strategy. Against all odds, C3&#8208;indolium intermediates could be generated from NH&#8208;indoles under operationally simple conditions with triflic acid at room temperature to promote intra&#8208; and intermolecular C3&#8208;regioselective hydroarylation. DFT studies suggest that these cationic or dicationic intermediates could be stabilized by H&#8208;bonded clusters.







Abstract
The direct dearomative addition of arenes to the C3 position of unprotected indoles is reported under operationally simple conditions, using triflic acid at room temperature. The present regioselective hydroarylation is a straightforward manner to generate an electrophilic indole at the C3 position from unbiased indoles in sharp contrast to previous strategies. This atom&#8208;economical method delivers biologically relevant 3&#8208;arylindolines and 3,3&#8208;spiroindolines in high yields and regioselectivities from both intra&#8208; and intermolecular processes. DFT computations suggest the stabilization of cationic or dicationic intermediates with H&#8208;bonded (TfOH)n clusters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct dearomative addition of arenes to the C3 position of unprotected indoles is reported under operationally simple conditions, using triflic acid at room temperature. The present regioselective hydroarylation is a straightforward manner to generate an electrophilic indole at the C3 position from unbiased indoles in sharp contrast to previous strategies. This atom-economical method delivers biologically relevant 3-arylindolines and 3,3-spiroindolines in high yields and regioselectivities from both intra- and intermolecular processes. DFT computations suggest the stabilization of cationic or dicationic intermediates with H-bonded (TfOH)&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and Perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) are Simple Synthons for Nitrosylated Iron Sulfur Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple Fe2+ ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool, react with thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) to yield synthons to biologically&#8208;relevant Fe&#8722;S clusters.







Abstract
S/N crosstalk species derived from the interconnected reactivity of H2S and NO facilitate the transport of reactive sulfur and nitrogen species in signaling, transport, and regulatory processes. We report here that simple Fe2+ ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool (LIP), react with thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) to yield the dinitrosyl iron complex [Fe(NO)2(S5)]&#8722;. In the reaction of FeCl2 with SNO&#8722; we were able to isolate the unstable intermediate hydrosulfido mononitrosyl iron complex [FeCl2(NO)(SH)]&#8722;, which was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. We also show that [Fe(NO)2(S5)]&#8722; is a simple synthon for nitrosylated Fe&#8722;S clusters via its reduction with PPh3 to yield Roussin's Red Salt ([Fe2S2(NO)4]2&#8722;), which highlights the role of S/N crosstalk species in the assembly of fundamental Fe&#8722;S motifs.

         <title>Double&#8208;Modification Oriented Design of a Deep&#8208;UV Birefringent Crystal Functionalized by [B12O16F4(OH)4] Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;modification strategy, that is, introducing two types of anions (F and OH), is used to increase the polarizability anisotropy and HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap simultaneously. This leads to the discovery a new metal&#8208;free (NH4)4[B12O16F4(OH)4] with the unprecedented [B12O16F4(OH)4] giant cluster as a potential deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. It shows the largest birefringence (of &#916;nexp.=0.12 at 546.1&#8197;nm) among all inorganic hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is of significance to current technologies, and to this end, the birefringent crystal has emerged as an invaluable material as it allows for effective light modulation. Herein, a double&#8208;modification strategy driven by F and OH anions that makes double effects towards the critical property enhancement of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals is proposed. This leads to a new hydroxyborate (NH4)4[B12O16F4(OH)4] with giant cluster as a deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal with large birefringence (&#916;nexp.=0.12@546.1&#8197;nm). This birefringence is a record among inorganic hydroxyborates with experimentally measured birefringence. Structural analysis shows that the near&#8208;plane arrangement of [B12O16F4(OH)4] cluster is responsible for the large optical anisotropy. Theoretical calculations indicate that its &#960;&#8208;conjugated [BO3] and [BO2OH] units are the main source of this large optical anisotropy.

         <title>Controlling the Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Nanosized Molecular Upconverter to Tap into Luminescence Thermometry Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the energy transfer to establish the application potential for molecular upconverters is demonstrated in a molecular cluster aggregate (MCA). Using a spherical MCA with a judicious choice of the metal composition, we show luminescence thermometry accessed via molecular upconversion for the first time.







Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) in molecular species remains a highly sought&#8208;after property with vast potential applications in many fields. Until now, a few reports on molecular upconverters are limited to demonstrating upconversion. The low UC quantum yields (QY) and nuclearities hindered the application capabilities for molecular upconverters. To overcome these limitations, we report the use of a molecular cluster&#8208;aggregate (MCA) containing 20 lanthanide ions to target YbIII&#8208;TbIII&#8208;based cooperative UC. Upconversion quantum yield value of 1.04&#215;10&#8722;4&#8201;%, among the highest value observed for a molecular cooperative UC, was attained for the {Gd11Tb2Yb7} composition. Substitution of GdIII ions for EuIII centers opens a YbIII&#8594;TbIII&#8594;EuIII energy&#8208;transfer pathway, allowing the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of potential application for molecular UC. This report on upconversion&#8208;based luminescence thermometry in a molecular species endorses further development of upconversion properties of nanoscale MCAs.

         <title>Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4 via Pd&#948;+&#8208;Assisted Hydrodeoxygenation over CeO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal oxide nanosheets doped with positively charged Pd&#948;+ sites can act as the active sites of water activation to offer additional H* species, which could improve the probability of further protonation over the carbon&#8208;containing intermediates, thus promoting the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.







Abstract
Here, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets are designed to realize selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4. As a prototype, Pd&#8208;doped CeO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the active sites of Pd&#948;+ (2&lt;&#948;&lt;4) and Ce3+&#8722;Ov are revealed by quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Moreover, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra of D2O photodissociation and desorption verify the existence of the Pd&#8722;OD bond, implying that Pd&#948;+ sites can participate in water oxidation to deliver H* species for facilitating the protonation of the intermediates. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest the Pd doping could regulate the formation energy barrier of the key intermediates CO* and CH3O*, thus making CO2 reduction to CH4 become the favorable process. Accordingly, Pd&#8208;doped CeO2 nanosheets achieve nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity of CO2 photoreduction, with the raising CH4 evolution rate of 41.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Rapid and Sequential Dual Oxime Ligation Enables De Novo Formation of Functional Synthetic Membranes from Water&#8208;Soluble Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual oxime bond formation enables the spontaneous generation of functional membranes from non&#8208;amphiphilic, water&#8208;soluble precursors at physiological conditions in the micromolar concentration range. In situ lipid synthesis proceeds in the absence of detergents, facilitating membrane protein reconstitution.







Abstract
Cell membranes define the boundaries of life and primarily consist of phospholipids. Living organisms assemble phospholipids by enzymatically coupling two hydrophobic tails to a soluble polar head group. Previous studies have taken advantage of micellar assembly to couple single&#8208;chain precursors, forming non&#8208;canonical phospholipids. However, biomimetic nonenzymatic coupling of two alkyl tails to a polar head&#8208;group remains challenging, likely due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the initial coupling step. Here we demonstrate rapid de novo formation of biomimetic liposomes in water using dual oxime bond formation between two alkyl chains and a phosphocholine head group. Membranes can be generated from non&#8208;amphiphilic, water&#8208;soluble precursors at physiological conditions using micromolar concentrations of precursors. We demonstrate that functional membrane proteins can be reconstituted into synthetic oxime liposomes from bacterial extracts in the absence of detergent&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroxylation of Dihydrosilanes to Si&#8208;Chiral Silanols Catalyzed by In Situ Generated Copper(II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective hydroxylation of prochiral dihydrosilanes with water is expected to be a highly efficient way to access Si&#8208;chiral silanols, yet has remained unknown up to date. Herein, we describe a strategy for realizing this reaction: using an alkyl bromide as a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidant for invoking CuII species and chiral multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for effective enantiocontrol. The reaction readily provides a broad range of Si&#8208;chiral silanols with high enantioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility. In addition, we manifest the synthetic potential by establishing two synthetic schemes for transforming the obtained products into Si&#8208;chiral compounds with high structural diversity. Our preliminary mechanistic studies support a mechanism involving SET for recruiting chiral CuII species as the active catalyst and its subsequent  &#963;&#8208;metathesis with dihydrosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Precise, Bright, Photostable, and Biocompatible Cyanine Nanodots as Alternatives to Quantum Dots for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent imaging with fluorophores  has become a powerful way to explore complex biological systems and visualize nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, it is challenging to develop fluorophores with ideal physical and optical properties. We report a method to synthesize cyanine nanodots with single&#8208;molecule structure, well&#8208;defined particle size, customizable fluorescent spectrum, bright and stable fluorescence. These cyanine nanodots are acquired by the divergent synthesis of cyanine dyes&#8208;cored polylysine (PLL) dendrimers. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by synthesizing cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or cyanine 7 (Cy7) cored single&#8208;molecule nanodots up to eight generations with a size around 11 nm. We show these cyanine nanodots are capable of multiple biomedical applications, including multicolor cellular tracing and cancer imaging. These cyanine nanodots possess many merits of organic dots and quantum dots that are promising for future application.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Mn Metal Battery Enabled by Inorganic&#8208;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous batteries that use metal anodes exhibit maximum anodic capacity, whereas the energy density is still unsatisfactory partially due to the high redox potential of metal anode. Current metal anode is plagued by the dilemma that the redox potential of Zn is not low enough while Al, Mg, and others with excessively low redox potential cannot work properly in aqueous electrolytes. Mn metal with suitably low redox potential is a promising candidate, which was rarely explored before. Here, we report a rechargeable aqueous Mn metal battery enabled by a well&#8208;designed electrolyte and robust inorganic&#8208;organic interfaces. The inorganic Sn&#8208;based interface with a bottom&#8208;up microstructure is constructed to preliminarily suppress water decomposition. With this bubble&#8208;free interface, the organic interface can be formed via esterification reaction of sucrose triggered by acyl chloride in the electrolyte, generating a dense physical shield that isolates water while permitting Mn  2+  diffusion. Hence, a Mn symmetric cell achieves a superior plating/stripping stability for 200 hours, and a Mn||V  2  O  5  battery maintains approximately 100% capacity after 200 cycles. Moreover, the Mn||V  2  O  5  battery realizes a much higher output voltage than that of the Zn||V  2  O  5  battery, evidencing the possibility of increasing energy density through using Mn anode. This work develops a systematic strategy to stabilize Mn metal anode for Mn metal batteries, opening a new door towards enhanced voltage of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Multivalent Targeting of Siglecs with Photosensitizing Liposome Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modification of surfaces with multiple ligands allows the formation of platforms for the study of multivalency in diverse processes. Herein we use this approach for the implementation of a photosensitizer (PS)&#8208;nanocarrier system that binds efficiently to siglec&#8208;10, a member of the CD33 family of siglecs (sialic acid (SA)&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins). In particular, a zinc phthalocyanine derivative bearing three SA moieties (PcSA) has been incorporated in the membrane of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), retaining its photophysical properties upon insertion into the SUV&#180;s membrane. The interaction of these biohybrid systems with human siglec&#8208;10&#8208;displaying supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) has shown the occurrence of weakly multivalent, superselective interactions between vesicle and SLB. The SLB therefore acts as an excellent cell membrane mimic, while the binding with PS&#8208;loaded SUVs shows the potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Reveals the Evasive Hepatitis B Virus Capsid&#160;C&#8208;Terminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Experimentally determined protein structures often feature missing domains. One example is the C terminal domain (CTD) of the hepatitis B virus capsid protein, a functionally central part of this assembly, crucial in&#160;regulating&#160;nucleic&#8208;acid interactions, cellular trafficking, nuclear import, particle assembly and maturation. However, its structure remained elusive to all current techniques, including NMR. Here we show that the recently developed proton&#8208;detected fast magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning solid&#8208;state NMR at &gt;100 kHz MAS&#160;allows&#160;one&#160;to detect this domain and unveil its structural and dynamic behavior. We describe the experimental framework used and compare the domain&#8217;s behavior in different capsid states. The developed approaches extend solid&#8208;state NMR observations to residues characterized by large&#8208;amplitude motion on the microsecond timescale, and shall allow&#160;one to shed light on other flexible protein domains still lacking their structural and dynamic characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of an Arsenic Diradicaloid with a Cyclic C2As2&#8208;Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity studies of the first cyclic C  2  As  2  &#8208;diradicaloid {(IPr)CAs}  2  (  6  ) (IPr = C{N(Dipp)CH}  2  ; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ). Treatment of (IPr)CH  2  (  1  ) with AsCl  3  affords the Lewis adduct {(IPr)CH  2  }AsCl  3  (  2  ). Compound  2  undergoes stepwise dehydrochlorination to yield {(IPr)CH}AsCl  2  (  3  ) and {(IPr)CAsCl}  2  (  5a  ) or [{(IPr)CAs}  2  Cl]OTf (  5b  ). Reduction of  5a  (or  5b  ) with magnesium turnings gives  6  as a red crystalline solid in 90% yield. Compound  6  featuring a planar C  2  As  2  ring is diamagnetic and exhibits well resolved NMR signals. DFT calculations reveal a singlet ground state for  6  with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 8.7 kcal/mol. The diradical character of  6  amounts to 20% (CASSCF, complete active space self consistent field) and 28% (DFT). Treatments of  6  with (PhSe)  2  and Fe  2  (CO)  9  give rise to {(IPr)CAs(SePh)}  2  (  7  ) and {(IPr)CAs}  2  Fe(CO)  4  (  8  ), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild Acidosis&#8208;Directed Signal Amplification in Tumor Microenvironment via Spatioselective Recruitment of DNA Amplifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA biotechnology offers intriguing opportunities for amplification&#8208;based sensitive detection. However, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled manipulation of signal amplification for in situ imaging of tumor microenvironment remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based strategy that can spatial&#8208;selectively amplify the acidic signal in extracellular milieu of tumor to achieve specific imaging with improved sensitivity. The strategy, termed mild acidosis&#8208;targeted amplification (MAT&#8208;amp), leverages specific acidic microenvironment to engineer tumor cells with artificial DNA receptors through a pH (low) insertion peptide, which permits controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers via hybridization chain reaction. The acidosis&#8208;responsive amplification cascade enables significant fluorescence enhancement in tumors with reduced background signal in normal tissues, leading to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. These results highlight the utility of MAT&#8208;amp for in situ imaging of microenvironment characterized by pH disequilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydration of Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of water to alkenes is an important method for the synthesis of alcohols, but the regioselectivity of acid&#8208;catalyzed hydration of terminal alkenes yields secondary alcohols according to Markovnikov&#8217;s rule, making it difficult to obtain primary alcohols. Here we report a styrene monooxygenase that catalyzes the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of the terminal aryl alkenes under anaerobic conditions. This hydration provides primary alcohols in good yields (up to 100%), excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity (&gt;99:1), and good enantiomeric purity (60&#8208;83% ee). Residues Asn46, Asp100, and Asn309 are essential for catalysis suggesting an acid&#8208;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate that could account for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity. Our work reveals a new enzymatic tool with unusual regioselectivity based on the promiscuous catalytic activity of a monooxygenase.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Synthesis of Various Low&#8208;Bandgap Donor&#8208;Acceptor Alternating Conjugated Polymers via Living Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate that living Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) using RuPhos Pd G3 precatalyst is a versatile method for the precision synthesis of various donor&#8208;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers (DA ACPs). First, the living SCTP of biaryl monomers with combinations of both medium to strong A and D were optimized to produce DA ACPs with controlled number average molecular weight (Mn), narrow dispersity (&#208;, 1.05&#8211;1.29), and high yield (&gt;87%). Moreover, its expansion to controlled polymerization (Mn  = 9.2&#8211;40.0 kg/mol) of an A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2&#8208;D quateraryl monomer containing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP; strong A) was successful. The living SCTP also enabled the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of various diblock and triblock copolymers. Lastly, the DA ACPs showed tunable optical bandgap (Egopt  , from 1.29 to 1.77 eV) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (from &#8208;5.57 to &#8208;4.75 eV), while their block copolymers exhibited broad absorption ranges and promising visible light&#8208;harvesting properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired and Ligand&#8208;Regulated Unnatural Prenylation and Geranylation of Oxindoles with Isoprene under Pd Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, prenylation and geranylation are two important metabolic processes for the creation of hemiterpenoids and monoterpenoids under enzyme catalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated bioinspired unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles using the basic industrial feedstock isoprene through ligand regulation under Pd catalysis. Pentenylated oxindoles (with C5  added) were attained with high selectivity when using a bisphosphine ligand, whereas upon switching to a monophosphine ligand, selectivity toward geranylated oxindoles (with C10  added) was achieved. Moreover, the head&#8208;to&#8208;head product could be further isomerized to an internal skipped diene under Pd&#8722;H catalysis. No stoichiometric by&#8208;product was formed in the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Chemistry Engineered Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photoanode with Ultralow Onset Potential for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CConstruction of an intimate film/substrate interface is of great importance for a photoelectrode to achieve efficient photoelectrochemical performance. Inspired by coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) film is intimately grown on a titanium (Ti) coated substrate by an in&#8208;situ thermal condensation process. The as&#8208;prepared PCN photoanode exhibits a record low onset potential (Eonset) of &#8208;0.38 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a decent photocurrent density of 242 &#956;A/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE for water splitting. Detailed characterization confirms that the origin of the ultralow onset potential is mainly attributed to the substantially reduced interfacial resistance between the Ti coated substrate and the PCN film benefited from the constructed interfacial sp2 N&#8594;Ti coordination bonds. For the first time, the ultralow onset potential enables the PCN photoanode to drive water splitting without external bias with a stable photocurrent density of ~9 &#956;A/cm2 up to 1 hour.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiations of Fluorinated Arenes and Heteroarenes Using Magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;Diisopropylamide (MBDA) in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various fluoro&#8208;substituted aromatics and heterocycles were magnesiated with the hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble organomagnesium amide (iPr2N)2Mg (magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;diisopropylamide; MBDA) at non&#8208;cryogenic temperatures providing thermally stable arylmagnesium amides (or diheteroarylmagnesium amides in the case of heterocyclic substrates). Trapping reactions with typical electrophiles furnished polyfunctional fluoro&#8208;substituted building blocks.







Abstract
We report a convenient preparation of a new and storable magnesium amide (iPr2N)2Mg (magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;diisopropylamide; MBDA) which proved to be especially suitable for the non&#8208;cryogenic magnesiation of fluoro&#8208;substituted arenes and heteroarenes providing arylmagnesium amides (ArMgDA) or bis&#8208;heteroaryl magnesiums (HetAr)2Mg in hydrocarbons. Further reactions with electrophiles (aldehydes, ketones, allylic bromides, aryl halides (Negishi cross&#8208;coupling)) furnished a range of polyfunctional fluoro&#8208;substituted unsaturated building blocks. Several postfunctionalizations were described as well as NMR&#8208;studies confirming the dimeric structure of the base.

         <title>Enantiomorphic Single Crystals of Linear Lead(II) Bromide Perovskitoids with White Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White circularly polarized emission based on lead(II) bromide perovskitoids was successfully achieved. The emission results from the synergistic combination of chiral organic cations and lead bromide inorganic anions. The chiral lead(II) bromide perovskitoids are obtained through a concise synthesis process, and they show excellent white&#8208;emission photoluminescence quantum yields and ultrastable persistence in ambient conditions.







Abstract
Chiroptical hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as a new class of promising materials with mirror optical signal responses for optoelectronic applications. However, chiroptical white&#8208;emission materials have been scarcely unearthed. Herein, four pairs of hybrid lead(II) bromide perovskitoids were obtained, namely, (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)PbBr4 (R/S&#8208;MPz=(R)&#8208;(&#8722;)/(S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpiperazine) (1 and 2), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)3Pb2Br10&#8901;2&#8201;DMAc (3 and 4), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)PbBr4&#8901;0.5&#8201;MeCN (5 and 6) and (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)2Pb2Br8&#8901;DCM (7 and 8). Notably, they all exhibit ultrabroadband emission and chiroptical signals. Perovskitoids 3&#8211;6 even achieve white circularly polarized emission with a high dissymmetric factor (glum) (&#177;3&#215;10&#8722;3 for 3 and 4; &#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3 for 5 and 6). This new type of hybrid perovskitoids will attract attention and find applications in chiroptical fields because of the extensively and easily tunable photophysical properties.

         <title>Role of Nanoscale Roughness and Polarity in Odd&#8211;Even Effect of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) was investigated by studying the static contact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. Phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness is observed.







Abstract
The dependency of substrate roughness on wetting properties of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been studied extensively, but most previous studies used limited selection of probing liquid and range of surface roughness. These studies disregarded the limit to observation of sub&#8208;nanometer odd&#8211;even parity effect, hence are inconclusive. In this work we report the role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of SAMs by studying static con&#8208;tact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. By overlapping the roughness ranges with previous studies on Au, the limitation of surface roughness (RMS=1&#8197;nm) to observation of the odd&#8211;even effect using water as probing liquid was confirmed, but other probing liquid yielded different roughness&#8208;dependent behaviors, with more polar solvent showing more roughness&#8208;dependent behavior. Based on these observations, we concluded that there exists a phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness and molecule chain length, but whose determination is dependent on the probing liquid.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photoredox Catalysis Triggers Nitric Oxide Release for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis is used for the controlled release of nitric oxide signaling molecules under physiological conditions. This new NO&#8208;releasing platform shows excellent antimicrobial activity and kills bacteria by hyperpolarizing and permeabilizing bacterial membranes, which can not only eradicate pathogens but also accelerate the healing of MRSA&#8208;infected wounds.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a robust tool for chemical synthesis. However, it remains challenging to implement photoredox catalysis under physiological conditions due to the complex microenvironment and the quenching of photocatalyst by biologically relevant molecules such as oxygen. Here, we report that UV&#8208;absorbing N,N&#8242;&#8208;dinitroso&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine derivatives can be selectively activated by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 photocatalyst within micellar nanoparticles under visible light irradiation (e.g., 500&#8197;nm) through photoredox catalysis in aerated aqueous solutions to form quinonediimine (QDI) residues with concomitant release of NO. Notably, the formation of QDI derivatives can actively scavenge the reactive oxygen species generated by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, thus avoiding oxygen quenching of the photocatalyst. Further, we exemplify that the oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis&#8208;mediated NO release can not only kill planktonic bacteria in vitro but also efficiently treat MRSA infections in vivo.

         <title>Hierarchical Hollow Zinc Oxide Nanocomposites Derived from Morphology&#8208;Tunable Coordination Polymers for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six zinc&#8208;containing coordination&#8208;polymer particles (Zn&#8208;CPPs) with multivariate characters were selectively prepared using a ligand competition strategy and further calcined to form hollow ZnO microparticles. The secondary design integrates hollow ZnO and O&#8208;ZnIn2S4 into a hierarchical tubular architecture with double&#8208;heterojunction shells and efficient charge&#8208;transfer nanochannels for superior solar H2&#8208;releasing activity.







Abstract
Infinite coordination&#8208;polymer particles (CPPs) are promising materials for solar energy conversion with high efficiency. However, the range of organic ligands that may be used to create CPPs is limited, as are strategies for modification, thereby hindering the applications of such material.

&lt;p&gt;Six zinc-containing coordination-polymer particles (Zn-CPPs) with multivariate characters were selectively prepared using a ligand competition strategy and further calcined to form hollow ZnO microparticles. The secondary design integrates hollow ZnO and O-ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into a hierarchical tubular architecture with double-heterojunction shells and efficient charge-transfer nanochannels for superior solar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-releasing activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinite coordination-polymer particles (CPPs) are promising materials for solar energy conversion with high efficiency. However, the range of organic ligands that may be used to create CPPs is limited, as are strategies for modification, thereby hindering the applications of such material. In this paper, competitive evolution&#8211;morphological and structural change from Zn-based crystallites to amorphous particles is described. Controlled contribution of organic linkers selectively derived six Zn-CPPs with multivariate characters. Based on the diversity of these substructures, hollow zinc oxide particles were initially formed by self-pyrolysis of CPPs and effectively modified by ultrathin doped nanosheets. The obtained double-sided heterojunctions offer fully-covered active sites, bringing together efficient light-excited charge-transfer nanochannels, which exhibit an excellent solar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-releasing activity (e.g., 4512.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stable cyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile Approach to Produce Star Polymers Based on Coordination Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy based on coordination polymerization to synthesize star polymers with highly regular arms via a common insertion reaction between a carbon&#8211;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8211;alkyl species is proposed. The yield of star polymers reaches values as high as 91.8&#8201;%. Employing this method, a synthetic polyisoprene rubber with green strength up to 1.99&#8197;MPa superior to the natural rubber (RSS1: 1.43&#8197;MPa) was prepared for the first time.







Abstract
Many efforts have been devoted to preparing star polymers. Research into coordination polymerization, the most powerful stereoselective process to endow polymers with superb properties, lags far behind those achieved by radical polymerization and ionic polymerization. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to prepare star polymers with regular arms based on coordination polymerization via an insertion reaction between the carbon&#8211;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8211;alkyl species. Terminating a living cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization by using isocyanate as cross&#8208;linker (CL), a star polyisoprene with low polydispersity was obtained in high yield (91.8&#8201;%). A kinetic study showed the star polymer was formed via a step&#8208;growth procedure. The types of CL and the ratio of [CL]0&#8201;:&#8201;[Cat.]0 are key factors to determine the arm number and the yield of star polymer. Finally, synthetic IR rubber with a green strength up to 1.99&#8197;MPa superior to natural rubber (1.43&#8197;MPa) was prepared for the first time.

         <title>A Separation&#8208;Sensing Platform Performing Accurate Diagnosis of Jaundice in Complex Biological Tear Fluids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SiO2@Au@AuNPs substrate was constructed as a separation sensing platform. This separation performance depends on the pore size. Three types of diffusion occur, including interception, single&#8208;file diffusion and Fickian diffusion. This structure was integrated into a home&#8208;made tear assay kit for the diagnosis of jaundice.







Abstract
The detection of biomarkers in tears has aroused great interest owing to the advantages of non&#8208;invasive and rapid collection. The combination of ultrasensitivity and label&#8208;free detection of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors is expected to achieve real&#8208;time diagnosis in home medical care. However, the surface of SERS sensors is susceptible to biofouling and inactivation by biological impurities in tears, resulting in rapid degradation of sensitivity, limiting the commercialization of point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices. Herein, a binary nanosphere array with dual properties is constructed as a separation&#8208;sensing platform for the diagnosis of target molecules in tears. The upper part of the structure is composed of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and a sputtering Au layer, which can bind the target molecules that interact with Au and provide high&#8208;strength and high&#8208;density SERS hotspots. The lower half is an inactive SiO2 nanosphere array with periodic large pores that allows biological impurities to penetrate the lower part and be separated from the target analyte. Furthermore, this substrate was integrated into homemade tear kits, enabling simultaneous tear collection, pre&#8208;separation, and detection. Combined with the Raman spectra of tears and LDA analysis, we successfully identified patients with jaundice in clinics. This platform is expected to provide an opportunity for early disease screening based on biological fluids.

         <title>Hydrogen Production and Water Desalination with On&#8208;demand Electricity Output Enabled by Electrochemical Neutralization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange enables utilization of the chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings for hydrogen production with electricity output.







Abstract
Energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production can be achieved by using renewables or decoupling the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction from overall water splitting, which still needs electricity input. We have realized hydrogen production and water desalination with on&#8208;demand electricity output via an electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81&#8197;kWh electricity per m3 of hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with a high peak power density up to 85.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without an external electricity supply.

         <title>Rational Electrolyte Design toward Cyclability Remedy for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte is demonstrated to enable a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase conversion via controllable nucleophilic reactions to improve the performance of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The fluorinated ether as anti&#8208;solvent further minimizes polysulfides solubility, and simultaneously stabilizes the Na anode. The as&#8208;developed batteries achieved high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.







Abstract
Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology, owing to the merits of high energy density and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance has been severely hindered by the poor compatibility between the existing electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, containing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (MTFE) anti&#8208;solvent and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, can greatly enhance the reversibility and cyclability of RT Na&#8211;S batteries. A NaF&#8208; and Na3N&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase derived from FDMA and FEC enables a &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase&#8221; Na&#8211;S conversion, eliminating the shuttle of polysulfides. The MTFE not only reduces polysulfide dissolution, but also further stabilizes the Na anode via a tailored solvation structure. The as&#8208;developed RT Na&#8211;S batteries deliver a high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.

         <title>Photouncaging of Carboxylic Acids from Cyanine Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared Light**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocages based on cyanine dyes that are accessible on multigram scale enable the efficient delivery and release of carboxylic acids in live cells using tissue&#8208;penetrating near&#8208;infrared light. The photouncaging process was examined by using several techniques, with the findings suggesting a photooxidative pathway.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light (NIR; 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) offers unparalleled advantages as a biocompatible stimulus. The development of photocages that operate in this region represents a fundamental challenge due to the low energy of the excitation light. Herein, we repurpose cyanine dyes into photocages that are available on a multigram scale in three steps and efficiently release carboxylic acids in aqueous media upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820&#8197;nm. The photouncaging process is examined using several techniques, providing evidence that it proceeds via photooxidative pathway. We demonstrate the practical utility in live HeLa cells by delivery and release of the carboxylic acid cargo, that was otherwise not uptaken by cells in its free form. In combination with modularity of the cyanine scaffold, the realization of these accessible photocages will fully unleash the potential of the emerging field of NIR&#8208;photoactivation and facilitate its widespread adoption outside the photochemistry community.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Probes with Long&#8208;Lasting High Brightness for In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrabright activatable chemiluminescent probes were synthesized which were equipped with intramolecular hydrogen bonding to prolong their half&#8208;lives for in vivo imaging of neutrophils in peritonitis and psoriasis mouse models.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time optical imaging of immune cells can contribute to understanding their pathophysiological roles, which still remains challenging. Current sensitive chemiluminophores have issues of short half&#8208;lives and low brightness, limiting their ability for in vivo longitudinal monitoring of immunological processes. To tackle these issues, we report benzoazole&#8208;phenoxyl&#8208;dioxetane (BAPD)&#8208;based chemiluminophores with intramolecular hydrogen bonding for in vivo imaging of neutrophils. Compared with the classical counterpart, chemiluminescence half&#8208;lives and brightness of BAPDs in the aqueous solution are increased by &#8764; 33&#8208; and 8.2&#8208;fold, respectively. Based on the BAPD scaffold, a neutrophil elastase&#8208;responsive chemiluminescent probe is developed for real&#8208;time imaging of neutrophils in peritonitis and psoriasis mouse models. Our study provides an intramolecular hydrogen bonding molecular design for improving the performance of chemiluminophores in advanced imaging applications.

         <title>Controlling the Structure, Properties and Surface Reactivity of Clickable Azide&#8208;Functionalized Au25(SR)18 Nanocluster Platforms Through Regioisomeric Ligand Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlational properties of regioisomeric, azide&#8208;functionalized Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters have been explored, and the molecular structures of the neutral forms of these clusters have been obtained. Although the optical properties are similar, alterations to electrochemical profiles and cluster&#8211;surface reactivity with a strained&#8208;alkyne have been observed that appear to change as the position of the surface azido moiety is changed.







Abstract
To fine&#8208;tune structure&#8211;property correlations of thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters through post&#8208;assembly surface modifications, we report the synthesis of the o, m, and p regioisomeric forms of the anionic azide&#8208;functionalized [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; platform. They can undergo cluster&#8211;surface strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (CS&#8208;SPAAC) chemistry with complementary strained&#8208;alkynes. Although their optical properties are similar, the electrochemical properties appear to correlate with the position of the azido group. The ability to conduct CS&#8208;SPAAC chemistry without altering the parent nanocluster structure is different as the isomeric form of the surface ligand is changed, with the [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; isomer having the highest reaction rates, while the [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;o&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; isomer is not stable following CS&#8208;SPAAC. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction provide the molecular structure of the neutral forms of the three regioisomeric clusters, [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;o/m/p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3]0, which illustrates correlated structural features of the central core as the position of the azido moiety is changed.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Natural Lindenane Sesquiterpenoid Oligomers via a Triene as a Potential Biosynthetic Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated triene was evidenced as a universal synthetic and biosynthetic intermediate toward various natural lindenane oligomers under simulated physiological conditions with high stereoselectivity. The related oligomerization modes involve linear connection, head&#8208;to&#8208;head [4+2] cycloaddition, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail [4+2] cycloaddition, head&#8208;to&#8208;back [4+2] cycloaddition, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail [6+6] cycloaddition.







Abstract
A previously proposed triene of the lindenane skeleton was synthesized, characterized, and identified as the common intermediate for the non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of natural lindenane oligomers through linear, [4+2]&#8208;type and [6+6]&#8208;type homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208; dimerization under simulated physiological conditions. As a result, the following six natural products were successfully synthesized through thermal head&#8208;to&#8208;head, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail, and head&#8208;to&#8208;back binding modes: shizukaols&#8197;A and J, cycloshizukaol&#8197;A, chlorahupetone&#8197;F, chlotrichene&#8197;B, and trishizukaol&#8197;A.

         <title>Spectroscopic Fingerprints of Cavity Formation and Solute Insertion as a Measure of Hydration Entropic Loss and Enthalpic Gain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissecting hydration entropy and enthalpy into hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions from &#8220;wrap&#8221; and &#8220;bound&#8221; spectroscopic fingerprints in the low frequency THz range is reported. In the future, this THz&#8208;calorimetry decomposition method could be broadly applied to uncover local hydration thermodynamics, e.g. in molecular recognition.







Abstract
Hydration free energies are dictated by a subtle balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. We present here a spectroscopic approach, which gives direct access to the two main contributions: Using THz&#8208;spectroscopy to probe the frequency range of the intermolecular stretch (150&#8211;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and the hindered rotations (450&#8211;600&#8197;cm&#8722;1), the local contributions due to cavity formation and hydrophilic interactions can be traced back. We show that via THz calorimetry these fingerprints can be correlated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 with the group specific solvation entropy and enthalpy. This allows to deduce separately the hydrophobic (i.e. cavity formation) and hydrophilic contributions to thermodynamics, as shown for hydrated alcohols as a case study. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations quantitatively support our experimental results. In the future our approach will allow to dissect hydration contributions in inhomogeneous mixtures and under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydration free energies are dictated by a subtle balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. We present here a spectroscopic approach, which gives direct access to the two main contributions: Using THz-spectroscopy to probe the frequency range of the intermolecular stretch (150&#8211;200&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the hindered rotations (450&#8211;600&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the local contributions due to cavity formation and hydrophilic interactions can be traced back. We show that via THz calorimetry these fingerprints can be correlated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 with the group specific solvation entropy and enthalpy. This allows to deduce separately the hydrophobic (i.e. cavity formation) and hydrophilic contributions to thermodynamics, as shown for hydrated alcohols as a case study. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations quantitatively support our experimental results. In the future our approach will allow to dissect hydration contributions in inhomogeneous mixtures and under non-equilibrium conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Production of C3&#8211;C6 Acetate Esters via CO Electroreduction in a Membrane Electrode Assembly Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of C3&#8211;C6 acetate esters from the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide in a membrane electrode assembly cell is reported. The near water&#8208;free reaction conditions and the high local pH played key roles in the formation of the esters. Acetate esters could be produced with an unprecedented Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;22&#8201;% and with a current density of up to &#8722;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon monoxide reduction has been previously reported to yield a range of carbonaceous products including alcohols, hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids. However, esters, an important family of organic compounds, have not been formed. Herein, we report the electrosynthesis of C3 to C6 acetate esters (H3C&#8722;(C=O)&#8722;O&#8722;R) from carbon monoxide using copper catalysts in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Ethyl acetate and propyl acetate could be produced with an unprecedented total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;22&#8201;% and with a current density of up to &#8722;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, alongside minor quantities of methyl acetate and butyl acetate. The esters are produced via the addition reaction of ethenone (H2C=C=O) and alcohols produced during CO reduction. We show that the near water&#8208;free reaction conditions and the high local pH play key roles in the formation of the esters.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryl Phosphorus Compounds by Chiral&#8208;Phosphonium&#8208;Salt&#8208;Enabled Cascade Arene Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective organocatalytic cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl phosphorus compounds. The approach involves multistep arene formation promoted by multifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis and proceeds through a complex Thorpe&#8208;type cycloaddition/oxidative hydroxylation/aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl monophosphorus molecules, exemplified by atropisomeric 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl aminophosphines, are significant motifs in numerous chiral ligands/catalysts. Developing efficient methods for preparing phosphorus compounds with these privileged motifs is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a chiral&#8208;phosphonium&#8208;salt&#8208;catalyzed novel cascade between phosphorus&#8208;containing nitroolefins and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins, leading to a great diversity of atropisomeric biaryls bearing phosphorus groups in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The reaction features include a Thorpe&#8208;type cycloaddition/oxidative hydroxylation/aromatization cascade pathway with a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer process. Insight gained from our studies is expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of atropisomeric biaryl phosphorus compounds, offering a platform for developing new efficient chiral ligands and catalysts.

         <title>Fluorinating the Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Rational Molecular Design for Practical Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design principles of fluorinated molecules were proposed to construct a fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
The lifespan of practical lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries is severely hindered by the instability of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) emerges as a promising strategy to improve the stability of Li&#8208;metal anodes. The rational design of fluorinated molecules is pivotal to construct fluorinated SEI. Herein, design principles of fluorinated molecules are proposed. Fluoroalkyl (&#8722;CF2CF2&#8722;) is selected as an enriched F reservoir and the defluorination of the C&#8722;F bond is driven by leaving groups on &#946;&#8208;sites. An activated fluoroalkyl molecule (AFA), 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorobutane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol dinitrate is unprecedentedly proposed to render fast and complete defluorination and generate uniform fluorinated SEI on Li&#8208;metal anodes. In Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries under practical conditions, the fluorinated SEI constructed by AFA undergoes 183&#8197;cycles, which is three times the SEI formed by LiNO3. Furthermore, a Li&#8722;S pouch cell of 360&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 delivers 25&#8197;cycles with AFA. This work demonstrates rational molecular design principles of fluorinated molecules to construct fluorinated SEI for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Organic Cathodes for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries through Electron Cloud and Solvation Structure Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during this process. Based on the Nernst equation, a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change of the redox process was proposed that improved the output voltage of organosulfur&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries from 0.8&#8197;V to 1.7&#8197;V.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active organic materials, as a new generation of sustainable resources, are receiving increasing attention in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their resource abundance and tunable structure. However, organic molecules with high potential are rare, and the voltage of most reported organic cathode&#8208;based ZIBs is less than 1.2&#8197;V. Herein, we explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during the process. Then, we proposed a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change and eventually improve the output voltage of the organic electrode. Combining the regulation of the electron cloud of organic molecules and the manipulation of the solvation structure, the output voltage of an organosulfur compound based ZIB was greatly increased from 0.8&#8197;V to 1.7&#8197;V. Our results put forward a specific pathway to improve the working voltage and lay the foundation for the practical application of organic electrodes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;based oxyhydroxide catalyst was developed for CO2 photoreduction into formic acid.

         <title>Water Networks Repopulate Protein&#8208;Ligand Interfaces With Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;resolution crystal structures highlight the importance of water networks in protein&#8208;ligand interactions. However, as these are typically determined at cryogenic temperature, resulting insights may be structurally precise but not biologically accurate. By collecting 10 matched room&#8208;temperature and cryogenic datasets of the biomedical target Hsp90&#945;, we identified changes in water networks that impact protein conformations at the ligand binding interface. Water repositioning with temperature repopulates protein ensembles and ligand interactions. We introduce  Flipper  conformational barcodes to identify temperature&#8208;sensitive regions in electron density maps. This revealed that temperature&#8208;responsive states coincide with ligand&#8208;responsive regions and capture unique binding signatures that disappear upon cryo&#8208;cooling. Our results have implications for discovering Hsp90 selective ligands, and, more generally, for the utility of hidden protein and water conformations in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazide Derivatives for Defect Passivation in Pure CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3  perovskite presents preeminent chemical stability and desirable band gap as the front absorber for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, CsPbI3  perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still show low efficiency due to high density of defects in solution&#8208;prepared CsPbI3  films. Herein, three kinds of hydrazine derivatives (benzoyl hydrazine (BH), formohydrazide (FH) and benzamide (BA)) are designed to reduce the defect density and stabilize the phase of CsPbI3  . Calculation and characterization results corroborate that the carboxyl and hydrazine groups in BH form strong chemical bonds with Pb2+  ions, resulting in synergetic double coordination. In addition, the hydrazine group in the BH also forms a hydrogen bond with iodine to assist the coordination. Consequently, a high efficiency of 20.47% is achieved, which is the highest PCE among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based PSCs reported to date. In addition, an unencapsulated device showed excellent stability in ambient air.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sequential vertical polyfunctionalization of 2D addend&#8208;patterned graphene is still elusive. Here, we report a practical realization of this goal via a &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; approach, which is based on a combination of a lithography&#8208;assisted reductive functionalization approach and a post&#8208;functionalization step to sequentially and controllably link the molecular building blocks ethylpyridine, cis&#8208;dichlorobis(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium, and triphenylphosphine (4&#8208;methylbenzenethiol, respectively) on selected lattice regions of a graphene matrix. The assembled 2D hetero&#8208;architectures are unambiguously characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, revealing the stepwise stacking of the molecular building blocks on the graphene surface. Our method overcomes the current limitation of a one&#8208;layer&#8208;only binding to the graphene surface and opens the door for a vertical growth in the z&#8208;direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Restoration of the Immunogenicity of Tumor Cells for Enhanced Cancer Therapy via Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Copper Chaperone Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent progress in studying copper&#8208;dependent targets and pathways in the context of tumor treatment has provided new insights into therapeutic strategies of leveraging copper&#8208;dependent disease vulnerabilities and pharmacologically manipulation of intratumor copper transportation to improve chemotherapy. Here, we developed ROS&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles loaded with copper chaperone inhibitor DC_AC50 and cisplatin(IV) prodrug. The released DC_AC50 can promote a remarkable accumulation of intracellular cisplatin and copper through inhibition of the Atox1&#8208;ATPase pathways, thereby enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin and inducing significant ROS generation. Excessive ROS then elicit intense endoplasmic reticulin (ER) stress which facilitates the immunogenic cell death (ICD) spurring a sustained immune response. Our study suggests that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated copper chaperone inhibition via DC_AC50 can restore the immunogenicity of tumor cells for enhanced chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Degradation of Microplastics at the Liquid Interface of Ice Crystals in Frozen Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microplastics (MPs), as one of the emerging contaminants in various environmental media, have raised great concerns to ecosystems with persistent degradation resistance. Although numerous advanced technologies have been developed, the degradation of widespread MPs in natural environment is still lack of suitable technologies. Herein, for the first time, we discovered that MPs could be exceptional&#8208;rapidly degraded in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20 &#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (  3  PS*) in the narrow space of liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce&#160;singlet oxygen&#160;(  1  O  2  )&#160;. The  1  O  2  would boost PS oxidating in liquid layer thus further causing frozen&#8208;accelerated degradation. This finding not only offers a highly efficient MPs degrading pathway, but also sheds light on the unusual disposal of MPs in nature.</dc:description>

Herein, for the first time, we discovered that MPs could be exceptional-rapidly degraded in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20 &#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (  3  PS*) in the narrow space of liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce&#160;singlet oxygen&#160;(  1  O  2  )&#160;. The  1  O  2  would boost PS oxidating in liquid layer thus further causing frozen-accelerated degradation. This finding not only offers a highly efficient MPs degrading pathway, but also sheds light on the unusual disposal of MPs in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Li2S&#8211;Cu Nanocomposite Cathodes Enabled by Kinetically Favored Displacement Interconversion between Cu2S and Li2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high activation barrier, inferior rate performance, and short cycling life severely constrain the practical applications of the high&#8208;capacity Li2S cathode. Herein, we   fabricate   a Li2S&#8208;Cu nanocomposite   with a   drastically   reduced activation potential  , fast rate capability, and extraordinary cycling stability  even under a practically relevant areal capacity of 2.96 mAh cm&#8208;2  .  Detailed experimental investigations aided by theoretical calculations indicate that instead of converting to S8  via  troublesome soluble lithium polysulfides, Li2S is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable to react with Cu by the displacement reaction, which alters the redox couple from Li2S/S to Cu/Cu2S, leading to the excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, the stability of the composite is demonstrated in the full&#8208;cell configuration consisting of commercial graphite anodes. This work provides an innovative and effective approach to realize highly activated and stable Li2S cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Switchability of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetodielectric Effect Induced by Intermolecular Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing magnetic switchability into artificial molecular machines is fascinating for precise control of magnetism  via  external stimuli. Herein, a field&#8208;induced Co  II  single&#8208;molecule magnet was found to exhibit the reversible switch of Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion near room temperature, along with thermal conformational motion of the 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 rotor, which pulls the coordinated H  2  O to rotate through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and triggers a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition with  T  warm  = 282 K and  T  cool  = 276 K. Interestingly, the molecular magnetic anisotropy probed by single&#8208;crystal angular&#8208;resolved magnetometry revealed the reorientation of easy axis by 14.6&#176;. Moreover, ON/OFF negative magnetodielectric effects were respectively observed in the high&#8208;/low&#8208;temperature phase, which manifests the spin&#8208;lattice interaction in the high&#8208;temperature phase could be stronger, in accompanied by the hydrogen bonding between the rotating 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 and the coordinated H  2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed dehydratation as synthetic tool for generation of a new Na4SnS4 polymorph: Crystal structure, Na+ conductivity, and influence of Sb&#8208;substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the convenient synthesis and characterization of the new ternary thiostannate Na4SnS4 (space group ) by directed removal of crystal water molecules from Na4SnS4&#183;14H2O. The compound represents a new kinetically stable polymorph of Na4SnS4, which is transformed into the known, thermodynamically stable form (space group ) at elevated temperatures. Thermal co&#8208;decomposition of mixtures with Na3SbS4&#183;9H2O generates solid solution products Na4&#8208;xSn1&#8208;xSbxS4 (x=0.01, 0.10) isostructural to the new polymorph (x=0). Incorporation of Sb5+ affects the bonding and local structural situation noticeably evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, 119Sn and 23Na NMR, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates an enormous improvement of the ionic conductivity with increasing Sb content for the solid solution (s25&#176;C=2&#183;10&#8208;3, 2&#183;10&#8208;2, and 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8209;1 for x=0, 0.01, and 0.10), being several orders of magnitude higher than for the known Na4SnS4 polymorph.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract:  DNA/RNA duplexes containing metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated base pairs (metallo&#8208;base pairs) have potential applications in developing nucleic acid&#8208;based nanodevices and genetic code expansion. Many metallo&#8208;base pairs are formed within duplexes stabilized by Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs. Recently, the crystal structure of an Ag(I)&#8208;DNA nanowire with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional silver array was determined. Here, we present a new DNA helical wire, the &#8220;Ag(I)&#8208;DNA rod&#8221;, containing an uninterrupted array of 11 Ag(I) ions. The Ag(I)&#8208;DNA rod consisted of only C&#8208;Ag(I)&#8208;C, G&#8208;Ag(I)&#8208;G, G&#8208;Ag(I)&#8208;5&#8208;bromouracil (  Br  U), and  Br  U&#8208;Ag(I)&#8208;  Br  U metallo base pairs, with no Watson&#8208;Crick pairs. The Ag(I)&#8208;DNA rods were connected by non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;G pairs in crystals.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural designability of organic electrode materials makes them attractive for symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries (SAOBs) by virtue of different plateaus. However, quite a few works reported all&#8208;organic batteries and it is still challenging to develop a high performance organic material for SAOBs. Herein, a small molecule, 2,3,7,8&#8208;tetraaminophenazine&#8208;1,4,6,9&#8208;tetraone (TAPT), is reported for SAOBs. The rich C=O and C=N groups ensure the high capacity at both plateaus for C=O/C&#8208;O and C=N/C&#8208;N redox reactions, which are hence utilized as cathodic and anodic active centers respectively. Moreover, the presence of C=O, C=N and NH2 groups resulted in plentiful strong intermolecular interactions, leading to layered structures, insolubility and high stability. The rich functional groups also facilitated the chelation of N and O with Li cations and hence benefited the storage of Li cations. The electrochemical performances of TAPT&#8208;based SAOBs outperformed all of the previously reported SAOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Reprogramming of Kinases Expands Cellular Activities of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yielding synthetic route to bifunctional molecules that reprogram activities of protein kinase&#8197;C and engineered Abelson kinase to induce phosphorylation on neo&#8208;substrates is reported. These phosphorylations have promising inhibitory effects on the activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent cancer cells.







Abstract
Phosphorylation&#8208;inducing chimeric small molecules (PHICS) can enable a kinase to act at a new cellular location or phosphorylate non&#8208;native substrates (neo&#8208;substrates)/ sites (neo&#8208;phosphorylations).[1,&#8201;2] We report a modular design and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of such PHICS that endowed multiple new activities to protein kinase&#8197;C (PKC). For example, while PKC is unable to downregulate the activity of a gain&#8208;of&#8208;function variant (S180A) of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that evokes B cell malignancy phenotype, PHICS enabled PKC to induce inhibitory neo&#8208;phosphorylations on this variant. Furthermore, while PKC typically phosphorylates its membrane&#8208;associated substrates, PKC with PHICS phosphorylated multiple cytosol&#8208;based neo&#8208;substrates (e.g., BCR&#8208;ABL). Finally, a PHICS for BCR&#8208;ABL induced death of chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. These studies show the power of synthetic chemistry to expand the chemical and functional diversity of proteins in cells using bifunctional molecules.

     alt="Synthetic Reprogramming of Kinases Expands Cellular Activities of Proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-yielding synthetic route to bifunctional molecules that reprogram activities of protein kinase&#8197;C and engineered Abelson kinase to induce phosphorylation on neo-substrates is reported. These phosphorylations have promising inhibitory effects on the activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and BCR-ABL-dependent cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation-inducing chimeric small molecules (PHICS) can enable a kinase to act at a new cellular location or phosphorylate non-native substrates (neo-substrates)/ sites (neo-phosphorylations).&lt;sup&gt;[1,&#8201;2]&lt;/sup&gt; We report a modular design and high-yielding synthesis of such PHICS that endowed multiple new activities to protein kinase&#8197;C (PKC). For example, while PKC is unable to downregulate the activity of a gain-of-function variant (S180A) of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that evokes B cell malignancy phenotype, PHICS enabled PKC to induce inhibitory neo-phosphorylations on this variant. Furthermore, while PKC typically phosphorylates its membrane-associated substrates, PKC with PHICS phosphorylated multiple cytosol-based neo-substrates (e.g., BCR-ABL). Finally, a PHICS for BCR-ABL induced death of chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. These studies show the power of synthetic chemistry to expand the chemical and functional diversity of proteins in cells using bifunctional molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 2,3&#8208;Diarylallyl Amines with a Threonine&#8208;Derived P&#8208;Stereogenic Ligand for the Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinolines and Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>

         <dc:description>
A P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinooxazoline iridium catalyst prepared from L&#8208;threonine methyl ester provides very high enantioselectivity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylallyl amines. The synthetic applicability of the resulting 2,3&#8208;diarylpropyl amines is demonstrated with the preparation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines and 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, achieving the highest ee values reported to date for this class of compounds.







Abstract
Chiral compounds containing nitrogen heteroatoms are fundamental substances for the chemical, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. However, the preparation of some of these interesting scaffolds is still underdeveloped. Herein we present the synthesis of a family of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinooxazoline iridium catalysts from L&#8208;threonine methyl ester and their use in the asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylallyl amines, achieving very high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the 2,3&#8208;diarylpropyl amines obtained is demonstrated by their transformation to 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines and 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, which have not yet been obtained in an enantioselective manner by direct reduction of the corresponding aromatic heterocycles. This strategy allows the preparation of these types of alkaloids with the highest enantioselectivity reported up to date.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of a Kekul&#233; Hydrocarbon with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state Kekul&#233; hydrocarbon&#8212;a kinetically stabilized derivative of bisdibenzo[3,4&#8201;:&#8201;5,6]cyclohepta[1,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;2,1&#8208;d]benzene&#8212;has been designed and synthesized. Its triplet ground state has been confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent ESR measurements and its structure and fundamental physical properties have been determined. These results could lead to diversification of high&#8208;spin molecules for organic magnetic materials.







Abstract
Design, synthesis, and isolation of a Kekul&#233; hydrocarbon with a triplet ground state is described. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by ESR experiments, and the structure and fundamental physical properties were also revealed. The key feature of the molecular design is the decrease in the bonding interaction in the singlet state by aromatic stabilization of benzene rings and the increase of the exchange interaction of unpaired electrons which are favorable for the triplet state. These results contribute to the development of hydrocarbon&#8208;based organic magnetic materials.

         <title>Fluorescent Microswimmers Based on Cross&#8208;&#946; Amyloid Nanotubes and Divergent Cascade Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Nature's ability to harness intercellular metabolic products towards programming crucial functions, a new and rational approach has been developed to plug&#8208;in multi module functions within cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid microphases. By using amyloid nanotubes loaded with orthogonal enzymes, divergent cascade networks have been engineered that enable the generation of both fluorescence and motility.







Abstract
Shaped through millions of years of evolution, the spatial localization of multiple enzymes in living cells employs extensive cascade reactions to enable highly coordinated multimodal functions. Herein, by utilizing a complex divergent cascade, we exploit the catalytic potential as well as templating abilities of streamlined cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid nanotubes to yield two orthogonal roles simultaneously. The short peptide based paracrystalline nanotube surfaces demonstrated the generation of fluorescence signals within entangled networks loaded with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The nanotubular morphologies were further used to generate cascade&#8208;driven microscopic motility through surface entrapment of sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and catalase (Cat). Moreover, a divergent cascade network was initiated by upstream catalysis of the substrate molecules through the surface mutation of catalytic moieties. Notably, the resultant downstream products led to the generation of motile fluorescent microswimmers by utilizing the two sets of orthogonal properties and, thus, mimicked the complex cascade&#8208;mediated functionalities of extant biology.

         <title>A Chain&#8208;Growth Mechanism for Conjugated Polymer Synthesis Facilitated by Dinuclear Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of dinuclear nickel complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands as initiators for chain&#8208;growth polymerization of both donor and acceptor conjugated monomers is demonstrated. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the coupling of multiple metal centers with a redox&#8208;active ligand allows access to new radical pathways, thereby expanding the known methodologies for conjugated polymer synthesis.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are widely used in energy conversion and sensor applications, but their synthesis relies on imprecise step&#8208;growth or narrow&#8208;scope chain&#8208;growth methods, typically based on transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Here we report that a dinickel complex with a redox&#8208;active naphthyridine diimine ligand accesses new chain&#8208;growth mechanistic manifolds for both donor and acceptor conjugated polymers, represented by poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), poly(2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thienopyrazine), and poly(2&#8208;(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)benzotriazole). For the latter, our method is particularly effective: we achieve high degrees of polymerization (DP) (&gt;100) with moderate dispersities (&#272;) of &#8776;1.4. Mechanistic analysis supports a radical/radical anion chain&#8208;growth mechanism with organometallic intermediates instead of TM&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. Hence, our work develops new mechanisms for conjugated polymer synthesis and furnishes insights about the elementary reactivity of dinuclear complexes.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Skeleton of Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Materials towards High&#8208;Efficiency Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three boron/nitrogen&#8208;based deep&#8208;blue emitters with 7, 9, and 13 fused rings have been accessed by one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation from the same precursor. All the emitters possess CIEy coordinates below 0.08 and a narrow FWHM of only 15&#8211;18&#8197;nm. The &#960;&#8208;extension approach increases the oscillator strength (fosc), accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, and improves the color purity for MR&#8208;TADF emitters.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for high&#8208;resolution OLEDs, but the concurrent optimization of excited&#8208;state dynamics and color purity remains a tough challenge.

&lt;p&gt;Three boron/nitrogen-based deep-blue emitters with 7, 9, and 13 fused rings have been accessed by one-pot lithium-free borylation from the same precursor. All the emitters possess CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates below 0.08 and a narrow FWHM of only 15&#8211;18&#8197;nm. The &#960;-extension approach increases the oscillator strength (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;osc&lt;/sub&gt;), accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, and improves the color purity for MR-TADF emitters.

         <title>Amplification&#8208;Free Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Using CRISPR Cas13a and Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET biosensors are reported for target amplification&#8208;free and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and respiratory syncytial virus. The sensor harnesses the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and the high sensitivity of graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). The sensor performance was validated using synthetic targets, heat&#8208;inactivated virus samples, and clinical samples, showing a sensitivity comparable to that of RT&#8208;qPCR.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) systems have recently received notable attention for their applications in nucleic acid detection. Despite many attempts, the majority of current CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors in infectious respiratory disease diagnostic applications still require target preamplifications. This study reports a new biosensor for amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid detection via harnessing the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and ultrasensitive graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET achieves the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome down to 1 attomolar without target preamplifications. Additionally, we validate the detection performance using clinical SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 samples, including those with low viral loads (Ct value &gt;30). Overall, these findings establish our CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET among the most sensitive amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid diagnostic platforms to date.

         <title>Reversible Multilevel Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness and Multicolor Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Based on a Single&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;component organic small molecule with a high phosphorescence quantum yield (68.4&#8201;%) and multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness (mechanical and thermal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness) has been synthesized. The multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is based on a phase transition of the N&#8208;BOX from a crystalline state to an amorphous state. The phase transition regulates the reversible change of N&#8208;BOX between high&#8208;efficiency blue and yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
There are limited reports about the transformation of pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness at different RTP emission wavelengths under external stimuli. It is difficult to ensure efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) in different states of a single&#8208;component system. This research reports the conversion of the organic single&#8208;component small molecule 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (N&#8208;BOX) with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness between high&#8208;efficiency blue and yellow RTP by grinding or thermal annealing N&#8208;BOX crystals. The RTP emission of N&#8208;BOX in the crystalline state was easy to adjust by external stimuli (grinding or thermal annealing) due to its non&#8208;compact packing, which led to a phase transition and generated unique multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In particular, the RTP quantum yield of 7&#8208;BOX with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness reached 68.4&#8201;%, which provides an opportunity for regulation of smart optical materials based on pure organic RTP.

         <title>Quantification of Biocatalytic Transformations by Single Microbial Cells Enabled by Tailored Integration of Droplet Microfluidics and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic platform for investigating the biocatalytic conversion of substrates into products at the single&#8208;cell level by mass spectrometry is presented. The platform was used to obtain product formation rates for individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.







Abstract
Improving the performance of chemical transformations catalysed by microbial biocatalysts requires a deep understanding of cellular processes. While the cellular heterogeneity of cellular characteristics, such as the concentration of high abundant cellular content, is well studied, little is known about the reactivity of individual cells and its impact on the chemical identity, quantity, and purity of excreted products. Biocatalytic transformations were monitored chemically specific and quantifiable at the single&#8208;cell level by integrating droplet microfluidics, cell imaging, and mass spectrometry. Product formation rates for individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were obtained by i) incubating nanolitre&#8208;sized droplets for product accumulation in microfluidic devices, ii) an imaging setup to determine the number of cells in the droplets, and iii) electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry for reading the chemical contents of individual droplets. These findings now enable the study of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis at single&#8208;cell resolution.

         <title>Enantioselective (8+3) Cycloadditions by Activation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes Employing Chiral Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;covalent organocatalytic enantioselective (8+3) cycloaddition of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes and heptafulvenoids is reported. The reaction design employs an anionic cyclopropane activation strategy by employing a bifunctional optically&#8208;active Br&#248;nsted base. The reaction pathway and mechanism of stereochemical control was investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
A novel enantioselective (8+3) cycloaddition between donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes and heptafulvenoids catalysed by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base is described. Importantly, the reaction, which leverages an anionic activation strategy, is divergent from prototypical Lewis&#8208;acid activation protocols. A series of cyclopropylketones react with tropones affording the desired (8+3) cycloadducts in high yield and enantiomeric excess. For barbiturate substituted heptafulvenes, the (8+3) cycloaddition with cyclopropylketones proceeds in good yield, excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantiomeric excess. The experimental work is supported by DFT calculations, which indicate that the bifunctional organocatalyst activates both the donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropane and tropone; the reaction proceeds in a step&#8208;wise manner with the ring&#8208;closure being the stereodetermining step.

         <title>Cationic P,O&#8208;Coordinated Nickel(II) Catalysts for Carbonylative Polymerization of Ethylene: Unexpected Productivity via Subtle Electronic Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The installation of substituents with strong electron&#8208;donating capacity on diphosphazane monoxide ligands provides a highly efficient cationic Ni catalyst. It exhibits a remarkable productivity of 31&#8201;150&#8197;g&#8201;PK&#8201;(g&#8201;Ni)&#8722;1 for alternating copolymerization of ethylene with CO. The use of non&#8208;noble Ni catalysts for efficient synthesis of polyketone co&#8208; and ter&#8208;polymers in the industry renders this methodology extremely appealing.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide affords polyketones materials with excellent mechanical strength, photodegradability, surface and barrier properties. Unlike the widely used and rather expensive Pd catalysts, Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative polymerization is very difficult since the strong binding affinity of CO to Ni deactivates the highly electrophilic metal center easily. In this study, various cationic P,O&#8208;coordinated Ni complexes were synthesized using the electronic modulation strategy, and the catalyst with strong electron&#8208;donating substituents exhibits an excellent productivity of 104&#8197;g&#8201;polymer&#8201;(g&#8201;Ni)&#8722;1, which represents a rare discovery that a Ni complex could operate with such exceptional efficiency in comparison with Pd catalysts. Notably, those Ni catalysts were also efficient for terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene with CO for producing commercial polyketone materials with low melting temperatures and easy processibility.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Multienzyme Compartmentalization for Terpene Biosynthesis in a Prokaryote</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prokaryotic cells generally lack organelles to compartmentalize the intracellular content. When liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated protein condensates were constructed inside E.&#8197;coli, membraneless organelles were created to compartmentalize terpene biosynthetic enzymes. Compartmentalizing the enzymes in protein condensates increased the production rate of the terpene product, showing this method to be an effective way of enhancing heterologous biosynthesis.







Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) forms biomolecular condensates or coacervates in cells. Metabolic enzymes can form phase&#8208;separated subcellular compartments that enrich enzymes, cofactors, and substrates. Herein, we report the construction of synthetic multienzyme condensates that catalyze the biosynthesis of a terpene, &#945;&#8208;farnesene, in the prokaryote E.&#8197;coli. RGGRGG derived from LAF&#8208;1 was used as the scaffold protein to form the condensates by LLPS. Multienzyme condensates were then formed by assembling two enzymes Idi and IspA through an RIAD/RIDD interaction. Multienzyme condensates constructed inside E.&#8197;coli cells compartmentalized the cytosolic space into regions of high and low enzyme density and led to a significant enhancement of &#945;&#8208;farnesene production. This work demonstrates LLPS&#8208;driven compartmentalization of the cytosolic space of prokaryotic cells, condensation of a biosynthetic pathway, and enhancement of the biosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;farnesene.

         <title>Towards Upcycling Biomass&#8208;Derived Crosslinked Polymers with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodegradable, recyclable, and renewable crosslinked polymers from bioresources show promise towards developing a sustainable strategy to address the issue of plastic degradability and recyclability.







Abstract
Photodegradable, recyclable, and renewable, crosslinked polymers from bioresources show promise towards developing a sustainable strategy to address the issue of plastics degradability and recyclability. Photo processes are not widely exploited for upcycling polymers in spite of the potential to have spatial and temporal control of the degradation in addition to being a green process. In this report we highlight a methodology in which biomass&#8208;derived crosslinked polymers can be programmed to degrade at &#8776;300&#8197;nm with &#8776;60&#8201;% recovery of the monomer. The recovered monomer was recycled back to the crosslinked polymer.

         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric radical cyclization of alkenes via stereospecific homolytic substitution of sulfonamides was established, allowing ready access to a diversity of cyclic sulfinamides with excellent stereocontrol. The protocol offers a robust tool for the synthesis of chiral sulfinamides and their derivatives.







Abstract
We report a novel asymmetric radical cyclization of alkenes via stereospecific homolytic substitution of sulfinamides. This reaction produces a variety of cyclic sulfinamides with excellent stereocontrol. The protocol features broad functional group tolerance, high product diversity, and easy accessibility to feedstocks, and outlines a new pathway for the synthesis of chiral cyclic sulfinamides.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of PNP ligands (W&#8208;Phos) was designed and applied in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of linear Grignard reagents to ketones, allowing ready access to versatile chiral tertiary alcohols in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The asymmetric catalytic addition of linear Grignard reagents to ketones has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, a novel family of PNP ligands (W&#8208;Phos) was designed and applied in copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of linear Grignard reagents to aryl alkyl ketones, allowing facile access to versatile chiral tertiary alcohols in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee). The process can also be used to synthesize chiral allylic tertiary alcohols from more challenging &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Notably, the potential utility of this method is demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and modification of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Alkyl Sulfoxides as Radical Precursors and Their Use in the Synthesis of Pyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the use of simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides as precursors to radicals and their application in the preparation of pyridine derivatives. We show that alkyl sulfoxides,  N  &#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form EDA complexes in solution, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to afford various pyridine derivatives smoothly. This reaction displays broad scope with respect to both sulfoxides and  N  &#8208;methoxy pyridiniums. The synthetic versatility of sulfoxides as a handle in chemistry adds to their power as radical precursors. Glycosyl sulfoxides are converted to the corresponding pyridyl  C  &#8208;glycosides with high stereoselectivities. Computational and experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Synthesis and Anti&#8208;Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth Activity of a Highly Branched Heptadecasaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactive polysaccharides from natural resources target various biological processes and are increasingly used as potential target molecules for drug development. However, the accessibility of branched and long complex polysaccharide active domains with well&#8208;defined structures remains a major challenge. Herein we describe an efficient first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from  Carthamus tinctorius  L. as well as shorter fragments of the heptadecasaccharide. The key feature of the approach is that a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy enables rapid assembly of the heptadecasaccharide, whereby a photoremovable  o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group is used to generate the corresponding acceptor for glycosylation  in situ  upon ultraviolet radiation. Biological activity tests suggest that the heptadecasaccharide can target galectin&#8208;3 and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Porous Organic Polymer Films for High&#8208;Performance Memristors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The porous organic polymer films (PFs) with intrinsical porosity and tuneable pore environment are ideally suited for application in electronic devices. However, the huge challenges still exist for construction of electronic devices based on PFs owing to lack of robustness, processability, and controllable preparation. Herein, we report the electrochemical preparation of carbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer films (eCPFs) for memristors. These eCPFs possess the characteristics of controllable thickness/size, high stability, and excellent porosity. Carbazole and cyano groups are introduced into the eCPFs to constructing electron transfer systems, respectively. Thus the memristors constructed based on these eCPFs exhibit excellent switching performance, reliability, and reproducibility. The electrochemically controllable preparation method of porous organic polymer membranes proposed in this paper provides a feasible idea for the developments of electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Visualization of Entangled 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Valency Stereoscopic Molecular Nodes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural diversity of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are limited as there are only a few choices of building units with multiple symmetrically distributed connection sites. To date, 4 and 6&#8208;connected stereoscopic nodes with Td, D3h, D3d and C3 symmetries have been mostly reported, delivering limited 3D topologies. We propose an efficient approach to expand the 3D COF repertoire by introducing a high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic node with a connectivity of eight, based on which two isoreticular 3D imine&#8208;linked COFs can be created. Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy allows the direct visualization of their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated bcu networks. These 3D COFs are endowed with unique pore architectures and strong molecular binding sites, and exhibit excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The introduction of high&#8208;valency stereoscopic nodes would lead to an outburst of new topologies for 3D COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclopentyl Boronic Esters Bearing Contiguous Fully Substituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing two or more contiguous, quaternary stereocenters is challenging, owing to the difficulty in controlling stereochemistry whilst simultaneously constructing a sterically congested motif. Herein, we report the electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes for the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, quaternary stereocenters with high levels of stereocontrol. Remarkably, simple variation of the reaction solvent enabled their diastereodivergent construction with facile access to complementary diastereomeric pairs. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8209;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Co Pair Sites Catalyst Boosts the Energetics for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the coordination environment of the active center via anions modulation to reveal tailored activity and selectivity has been widely achieved, especially for carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs). However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single&#8208;site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing Ru/LiCoO  2  SAC with atomically dispersed Ru&#8208;Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near&#8208;optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000 A g  oxide  &#8208;1  at a small overpotential of 335 mV, and excellent long&#8208;term stability. It also exhibits rapid kinetics with superior rate capability and outstanding durability in a zinc&#8208;air battery.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Nanoconfinement on Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advances in nanoscale fabrication techniques have promoted the development of electrocatalysts where the electrochemical reactions occur within a nanoconfined space. This Review explores how different degrees of freedom of nanoconfinement affects the electrocatalytic activity for a range of reactions and how implementing nanoconfinement can help break linear scaling relationships.







Abstract
The use of nanoparticles and nanostructured electrodes are abundant in electrocatalysis. These nanometric systems contain elements of nanoconfinement in different degrees, depending on the geometry, which can have a much greater effect on the activity and selectivity than often considered. In this Review, we firstly identify the systems containing different degrees of nanoconfinement and how they can affect the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions. Then we follow with a fundamental understanding of how electrochemistry and electrocatalysis are affected by nanoconfinement, which is beginning to be uncovered, thanks to the development of new, atomically precise manufacturing and fabrication techniques as well as advances in theoretical modeling. The aim of this Review is to help us look beyond using nanostructuring as just a way to increase surface area, but also as a way to break the scaling relations imposed on electrocatalysis by thermodynamics.

These nanometric systems contain elements of nanoconfinement in different degrees, depending on the geometry, which can have a much greater effect on the activity and selectivity than often considered. In this Review, we firstly identify the systems containing different degrees of nanoconfinement and how they can affect the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions. Then we follow with a fundamental understanding of how electrochemistry and electrocatalysis are affected by nanoconfinement, which is beginning to be uncovered, thanks to the development of new, atomically precise manufacturing and fabrication techniques as well as advances in theoretical modeling. The aim of this Review is to help us look beyond using nanostructuring as just a way to increase surface area, but also as a way to break the scaling relations imposed on electrocatalysis by thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Homoallylic Amines by Radical Allylation of Imines with Butadiene under Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conceptually novel metal&#8208;free single electron (1&#8201;e&#8722;) mediated allylation of imines with butadiene and alkyl halides is reported. This operationally simple method provides efficient access to a broad range of structurally diverse homoallylic amines with exceptional functional&#8208;group compatibility.







Abstract
Ionic (2&#8201;e&#8722;) nucleophilic addition of allylmetal regents to imines dominates the synthesis of homo&#8208;allyl amine; however, single electron (1&#8201;e&#8722;) mediated imine allylation with feedstocks butadiene as an alternative allyl source remains unexplored. In this work, we report a conceptually different radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the synthesis of a homoallyl amine between an &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radical and a transient allylic radical. This metal&#8208;free method provided a novel approach for the synthesis of homoallylic amines (&gt;80 examples) from readily available materials with excellent regioselectivity and exceptional broad functional group compatibility.

         <title>Metathesis between E&#8722;C(spn) and H&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;Bonds (E=Si, Ge; n=2, 3) on an Osmium&#8208;Polyhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pentahydride&#8208;silyl/germyl&#8208;osmim(VI) derivatives was prepared. These d2&#8208;species of a late transition metal undergo a novel metathesis reaction between non&#8208;activated E&#8722;C(spn) and H&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;bonds (E=Si, Ge; n=2, 3) affording new osmium(IV) tetrahydride complexes bearing phosphino&#8208;silane and phosphino&#8208;germane chelate ligands.







Abstract
The silylation of a phosphine of OsH6(PiPr3)2 is performed via net&#8208;metathesis between Si&#8722;C(spn) and H&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;bonds (n=2, 3). Complex OsH6(PiPr3)2 activates the Si&#8722;H bond of Et3SiH and Ph3SiH to give OsH5(SiR3)(PiPr3)2, which yield OsH4{&#954;1&#8208;P,&#951;2&#8208;SiH&#8208;[iPr2PCH(Me)CH2SiR2H]}(PiPr3) and R&#8722;H (R=Et, Ph), by displacement of a silyl substituent with a methyl group of a phosphine. Such displacement is a first&#8208;order process, with activation entropy consistent with a rate determining step occurring via a highly ordered transition state. It displays selectivity, releasing the hydrocarbon resulting from the rupture of the weakest Si&#8208;substituent bond, when the silyl ligand bears different substituents. Accordingly, reactions of OsH6(PiPr3)2 with dimethylphenylsilane, and 1,1,1,3,5,5,5&#8208;heptamethyltrisiloxane afford OsH5(SiR2R&#8242;)(PiPr3)2, which evolve into OsH4{&#954;1&#8208;P,&#951;2&#8208;GeH&#8208;[iPr2PCH(Me)CH2SiR2H]}(PiPr3) (R=Me, OSiMe3) and R&#8242;&#8722;H (R&#8242;=Ph, Me). Exchange reaction is extended to Et3GeH. The latter reacts with OsH6(PiPr3)2 to give OsH5(GeEt3)(PiPr3)2, which loses ethane to form OsH4{&#954;1&#8208;P,&#951;2&#8208;GeH&#8208;[iPr2PCH(Me)CH2GeEt2H]}(PiPr3).

         <title>Direct Conversion of Syngas to Higher Alcohols via Tandem Integration of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis and Reductive Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst engineering enables the single&#8208;pot integration of solid nanoparticulate and molecular cobalt catalysts in a slurry&#8208;phase tandem Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis/olefin reductive hydroformylation process for a direct and highly selective conversion of syngas (H2/CO) to higher alcohols. The new tandem process contributes to bridging the traditionally dissevered disciplines of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The selective conversion of syngas to higher alcohols is an attractive albeit elusive route in the quest for effective production of chemicals from alternative carbon resources. We report the tandem integration of solid cobalt Fischer&#8211;Tropsch and molecular hydroformylation catalysts in a one&#8208;pot slurry&#8208;phase process. Unprecedented selectivities (&gt;50&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to C2+ alcohols are achieved at CO conversion levels &gt;70&#8201;%, alongside negligible CO2 side&#8208;production. The efficient overall transformation is enabled by catalyst engineering, bridging gaps in operation temperature and intrinsic selectivity which have classically precluded integration of these reactions in a single conversion step. Swift capture of 1&#8208;olefin Fischer&#8211;Tropsch primary products by the molecular hydroformylation catalyst, presumably within the pores of the solid catalyst is key for high alcohol selectivity. The results underscore that controlled cooperation between solid aggregate and soluble molecular metal catalysts, which pertain to traditionally dichotomic realms of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, is a promising blueprint toward selective conversion processes.

         <title>Solar Energy Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar energy catalysis is a specific and &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; definition for catalytic reactions that utilize solar light as the energy input. Based on the different conversion pathways, solar energy catalysis can be divided into photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered catalysis, pyroelectric catalysis, and the combined effect of some of these processes.







Abstract
When it comes to using solar energy to promote catalytic reactions, photocatalysis technology is the first choice. However, sunlight can not only be directly converted into chemical energy through a photocatalytic process, it can also be converted through different energy&#8208;transfer pathways. Using sunlight as the energy source, photocatalytic reactions can proceed independently, and can also be coupled with other catalytic technologies to enhance the overall catalytic efficiency. Therefore, sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic reactions are diverse, and need to be given a specific definition. We propose a timely perspective for catalytic reactions driven by sunlight and give them a specific definition, namely &#8220;solar energy catalysis&#8221;. The concept of different types of solar energy catalysis, such as photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered electrocatalysis, and pyroelectric catalysis, are highlighted. Finally, their limitations and future research directions are discussed.

The concept of different types of solar energy catalysis, such as photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered electrocatalysis, and pyroelectric catalysis, are highlighted. Finally, their limitations and future research directions are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zeolitic Hollow&#8208;Fiber Membranes by a Viscosity&#8208;Confined Dry Gel Conversion Process for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach (viscosity&#8208;confined dry gel conversion, VCDGC) is demonstrated for versatile fabrication of zeolite membranes on inexpensive hollow fibers. VCDGC does not require liquid&#8208;phase hydrothermal processing and is amenable to integration with coating processes. The VCDGC synthesis allows preparation of high&#8208;quality CHA and MFI zeolite type membranes, which showed excellent performance in gas separations.







Abstract
Zeolite membranes show great potential for gas and hydrocarbon separations, but high manufacturing cost has been one of the main hurdles in their industrial application. Here we demonstrate a method termed viscosity&#8208;confined dry gel conversion (VCDGC) for zeolite hollow fiber membrane fabrication. We demonstrate in detail the VCDGC synthesis of small&#8208;pore CHA zeolite membranes. Extensive permeation measurements reveal that dry gel&#8208;processed CHA zeolite hollow fiber membranes have excellent gas and hydrocarbon separation characteristics well exceeding or comparable to current membranes. Medium&#8208;pore MFI membranes are also fabricated, and their favorable hydrocarbon separation characteristics indicate the versatility and reliability of the VCDGC method.

         <title>Switching Excited State Distribution of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Dramatically Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol was proposed to switch the excited state from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer to 3IL (intraligand) for dramatically improving the sensitizing ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Hierarchical integration of single&#8208;site catalysts into 3IL MOFs can directionally and rapidly steer electron transfer, leading to an extremely high H2 evolution activity and a record HCOOH yield among all the MOF photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photosensitization associated with electron/energy transfer represents the central science of natural photosynthesis. Herein, we proposed a protocol to dramatically improve the sensitizing ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by switching their excited state distribution from 3MLCT (metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer) to 3IL (intraligand). The hierarchical organization of 3IL MOFs and Co/Cu catalysts facilitates electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution with a yield of 26&#8201;844.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and CO2 photoreduction with a record HCOOH yield of 4807.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 among all the MOF photocatalysts. Systematic investigations demonstrate that strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorption, long&#8208;lived excited state and ingenious multi&#8208;component synergy in the 3IL MOFs can facilitate both interface and intra&#8208;framework electron transfer to boost photocatalysis. This work opens up an avenue to boost solar&#8208;energy conversion by engineering sensitizing centers at a molecular level.

         <title>In Vivo Production of Diverse &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural non&#8208;canonical peptide splicing reaction was repurposed to achieve incorporation of various &#946;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acid residues) at C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminal or internal positions of proteins. The protein backbone modification is carried out by a recently discovered family of peptide&#8208;modifying radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine enzymes in E. coli, suggesting diverse applications in chemical biology.







Abstract
The wide range of moieties installed in ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) suggests largely untapped potential for protein engineering. However, many RiPP maturases recognize target peptide precursors through an N&#8208;terminal leader sequence that is challenging to adapt to proteins. We have recently reported a family of enzymes that splice XYG sites in RiPPs to install &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Backbone modifications influence diverse protein properties, yet the toolkit to install &#946;&#8208;amino acids is limited. Here we report their leader&#8208;independent incorporation into proteins in E. coli. Integrating an 11&#8208;residue splice tag into six different proteins permitted the site&#8208;selective introduction of &#946;&#8208;residues in vivo. The motif fusion at C&#8208;, N&#8208;terminal, and internal positions yielded various &#946;&#8208;residues. Our approach complements the few existing methods to introduce &#946;&#8208;amino acids or ketone&#8208;bearing moieties, suggesting diverse applications in chemical biology.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper alkynyl charge separation units were constructed in aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)ethene aggregates (T4EPE) to generate a highly efficient photocatalyst T4EPE&#8208;Cu. The catalyst produces different ratios of 1O2 and O2.&#8722; products from 1.3 to 10.7 at the same site by light regulation. The mechanism of photo&#8208;regulated generation of reactive oxygen species was studied and its performance in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation evaluated.







Abstract
Active species regulation is a key scientific issue that essentially determines the selectivity and activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, CuI&#8208;bridged tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)ethene aggregates (T4EPE&#8208;Cu) with photo&#8208;regulated 1O2 and O2.&#8722; generation were demonstrated for selective photocatalytic aerobic oxidation. In this system, transient photovoltage combined with the density functional theory calculations confirmed that Cu&#8208;alkynyl was the main oxygen activation site. The adsorbed O2 tends to produce O2.&#8722; because of the potential well effect of Cu&#8208;alkynyl under high&#8208;energy light excitation. But under low&#8208;energy light, O2 tends to produce 1O2 via resonance energy transfer with Cu&#8208;alkynyl. For &#945;&#8208;terpinene oxidation, the ratios of 1O2 products to O2.&#8722; products can be controlled from 1.3 (380&#8197;nm) to 10.7 (600&#8197;nm). Furthermore, T4EPE&#8208;Cu exhibited ultrahigh photocatalytic performance for Glaser coupling and benzylamine oxidation, with a conversion and selectivity of over 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Fast Protein Modification in the Nanomolar Concentration Range Using an Oxalyl Amide as Latent Thioester**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxalyl thioesters are cell metabolites endowed with remarkably powerful acyl transfer abilities. The bioinspired design of stable and activatable oxalyl thioester surrogates and their application for the modification of peptides and proteins is reported. Formation of a stable oxalamide crosslink proceeds at rates &#8776;30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, in the nanomolar concentration range, in purified media or in protein extracts of cell lysates.







Abstract
We show that latent oxalyl thioester surrogates are a powerful means to modify peptides and proteins in highly dilute conditions in purified aqueous media or in mixtures as complex as cell lysates. Designed to be shelf&#8208;stable reagents, they can be activated on demand to enable ligation reactions with peptide concentrations as low as a few hundred nM at rates approaching 30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Functionalised Cofactor Mimics for Interactome Discovery and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cofactors are essential, but their functions and binding partners are not fully understood even after decades of research. Functionalised cofactor mimics that bind in place of the unmodified cofactor can provide answers, as well as expand the scope of cofactor activity. This Review outlines the growing use of cofactor mimics in interactome discovery, drug development, the study of post&#8208;translational modifications, and other novel biotechnologies.







Abstract
Cofactors are required for almost half of all enzyme reactions, but their functions and binding partners are not fully understood even after decades of research. Functionalised cofactor mimics that bind in place of the unmodified cofactor can provide answers, as well as expand the scope of cofactor activity. Through chemical proteomics approaches such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling, the interactome and localisation of the native cofactor in its physiological environment can be deciphered and previously uncharacterised proteins annotated. Furthermore, cofactors that supply functional groups to substrate biomolecules can be hijacked by mimics to site&#8208;specifically label targets and unravel the complex biology of post&#8208;translational protein modification. The diverse activity of cofactors has inspired the design of mimics for use as inhibitors, antibiotic therapeutics, and chemo&#8208; and biosensors, and cofactor conjugates have enabled the generation of novel enzymes and artificial DNAzymes.

         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free imaging and on&#8208;tissue top&#8208;down identification of proteoforms in tissues using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) mass spectrometry is demonstrated by Julia Laskin, Neil Kelleher, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200721). The differential expression of individual proteoforms provides first insights into cell&#8208;specific biological pathways in different regions of the tissue.

         <title>Impacts of Dissolved Ni2+ on the Solid Electrolyte Interphase on a Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8211;lithium ion exchange reaction&#160;in solid state interphase&#160;(SEI)&#160;on graphite anode is investigated by Jun Lu, Khalil Amine, Xinping Qiu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202202894). The Li+&#160;path is blocked due to the&#160;substitution of Li by Ni in the organic species, leading to the increase of resistivity&#160;of the SEI.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multichromophoric macrocycles and cyclophanes are important supramolecular architectures for the elucidation of interchromophoric interactions originating from precise spatial organization. Herein, by combining an axially chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) and a bay&#8208;substituted conformationally labile twisted perylene bisimide (PBI) within a cyclophane of well&#8208;defined geometry, we report a chiral PBI hetero&#8208;cyclophane (  BBI  &#8208;  PBI  ) that shows intramolecular energy and solvent&#8208;regulated chirality transfer from the BBI to the PBI subunit. Excellent spectral overlap and spatial arrangement of BBI and PBI lead to efficient excitation energy transfer and subsequent PBI emission with high quantum yield (80&#8208;98%) in various solvents. In contrast, chirality transfer is strongly dependent on the respective solvent as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The combination of energy and chirality transfer affords a bright red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the PBI chromophore by excitation of BBI.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Anchored on Graphene For Enhanced Organic Pollutant Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of great potential as adsorbents owing to their tailorable functionalities, low density and high porosity. However, their intrinsically stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure limits the full use of their complete surface for sorption, especially the internal pores. The construction of ultrathin COFs could increase the exposure of active sites to the targeted molecules in a pollutant environment. In this contribution, an ultrathin COF with a uniform thickness of ca. 2 nm is prepared employing graphene as the surface template. The resulting hybrid aerogel with an ultralow density (7.1 mg cm&#8208;3  ) exhibits the ability to remove organic dye molecules of different sizes with high efficiency. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroporous structure and well&#8208;exposed adsorption sites permit rapid diffusion of solution and efficient adsorption of organic pollutants, thereby, greatly contributing to its enhanced uptake capacity. This work highlights the effect of COF layer thickness on adsorption performance.</dc:description>

         <title>S,O&#8208;Ligand Promoted meta&#8208;C&#8211;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C  &#8722;H activation processes provides new retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds  . Here, we report a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene and an S,O&#8208;ligand for the  meta  &#8208;C  &#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers that significantly outperforms previously reported systems. We demonstrate the unique ability of this system to employ alkoxyarene substrates bearing electron donating and withdrawing substituents. Additionally,  ortho  &#8208;substituted aryl ethers are well tolerated, overcoming the &#8220;  ortho  constraint&#8221;, which is the necessity to have a  meta  &#8208;substituent on the alkoxyarene to achieve high reaction efficiency, by enlisting novel norbornene mediators. Remarkably, for the first time the monoarylation of alkoxyarenes is achieved efficiently enabling the subsequent introduction of a second, different aryl coupling partner to rapidly furnish unsymmetrical terphenyls. Further insight into the reaction mechanism was achieved by isolation and characterization of some Pd&#8208;complexes&#8212; before and after  meta  C&#8208;H activation&#8212;prior to evaluation of their respective catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Carbonylation of CH3Cl to Acetic Acid Catalyzed by Pyridine&#8208;Treated MOR Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added chemicals under mild conditions is of great significance for the commercially viable and sustainable utilization of methane but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a strategy for efficiently converting methane to acetic acid via CH3Cl as an intermediate. Up to 99.3% acetic acid and methyl acetate (AA+MA) selectivity was achieved over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR (MOR&#8208;8) under moderate conditions of 523 K and 2.0 MPa. Water, conventionally detrimental to carbonylation reaction over zeolite catalysts, was conducive to the production of AA in the current reaction system. In the 100 h continuous test with the MOR&#8208;8 catalyst, the average AA+MA selectivity remained over 98%. AA was formed by carbonylation of methoxy groups within 8&#8208;membered rings of MOR followed by hydrolysis. This strategy provided an approach for highly efficient utilization of methane to oxygenates under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrically Doping a Platium Atom into a Au38 Nanocluster for Changing the Electron Configuration and Reactivity in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It becomes an obstacle to precisely manipulate a doped heteroatom into a desired position of a metal nanocluster. Here, we overcome such a difficulty to obtain Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters via controllably doping Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24. We reveal that asymmetrical doping of one Pt atom into either core of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 elevates relative energy of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) accompanied by one free valence electron loss of Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24, compared to Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 with 14 electrons, while symmetrical doping of two Pt atoms into the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 narrows the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (LUMO: lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 with two valence electrons less. Consequently, Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 shows an electron&#8208;spin&#8208;induced high activity for CO2 electroreduction, whereas Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 is least efficient and Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 has a decent performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;Rearrangement of Porous Organic Cage Membrane for CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous Organic Cages (POCs) with tunable tailoring chemistry properties and polymer&#8208;like processing conditions are of great potential for molecular selective membranes, but it remains challenging in the assembly of high crystalline POCs with regular nanochannels for effective molecular sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;rearrangement strategy for the design of POC membrane with hetero&#8208;structure. Due to electrostatic attraction, ionic liquid molecules induced cage molecules to rearrange into a sub&#8208;10 nm uniform and defect&#8208;free crystal layer, thus owning competitive CO  2  separation performance. The optimized hetero&#8208;structured membrane exhibited an attractive CO  2  /N  2  separation selectivity of over 130 which was superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes, accompanied with excellent long&#8208;term and thermal shock stability. This strategy provides a new inspiration for the preparation of crystal&#8208;rearranged membrane with regular channels for gas molecule sieving.</dc:description>

         <title>Sirtuin&#8208;Derived Covalent Binder for the Selective Recognition of Protein Crotonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is increasingly recognized as a key protein post&#8208;translational modification. However, selective detection and enrichment of crotonylated proteins remains a challenging task. Herein we present a covalent binder for the selective recognition of protein crotonylation. Based on proximity&#8208;induced crosslinking, a bacterial sirtuin (CobB) was remodeled with genetically installed thiol&#8208;bearing noncanonical amino acids at Kcr&#8208;interacting site, which subsequently could react with Kcr sites in a unique NAD  +  dependent manner. The covalent binder has been used to selectively recognize crotonylated proteins in extracted histone samples and in fixed cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Polyimide&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework with Multiple Redox&#8208;active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Cathodic Li Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are gaining increasing attention as renewable cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, COFs electrodes reported so far still exhibit unsatisfying capacity due to their limited active site density and insufficient utilization. Herein, a new two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked COF, HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF with multiple redox&#8208;active sites for storing Li  +  ions, was designed and fabricated from a new module of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacarboxyl hexaazatrinaphthalene trianhydrides with 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone linker. HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF possessing excellent stability, good conductivity, and a large pore size of 3.8 nm enables the stable and fast ion transport. This, in combination with the abundant redox active sites, results in a high reversible capacity of 319 mA h g  &#8722;1  at 0.5 C (1 C = 358 mA g  &#8208;1  ) for the HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF electrode with a high active site utilization of 89% and good cycle performance, representing one of the best performances among the reported COFs electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol at Close to Theoretical Potential via Engineering Abundant Electron&#8208;Donating Cu&#948;+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction to liquid multi&#8208;carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu  &#948;+  (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the  in situ  formed Cu  &#948;+  is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu  0  . Here a Cu  2  S  1&#8208;x  catalyst with abundant Cu  &#948;+  (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species is designedly  synthesized  and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19 V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9% and Faradaic efficiency of 73.3% but also provides a long&#8208;term stability of Cu  &#948;+  , gaining an economic profit based on techno&#8208;economic analysis. The calculation and  in situ  spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu  &#948;+  sites own electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8211;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe2+/Fe3+ Cycling for Coupling Self&#8208;powered Hydrogen Evolution and Preparations of Electrode Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel Zn&#8208;Fe flow battery featuring Fe3+ reduction reaction (Fe3+RR)&#8208;coupled zinc oxidation, and a Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system as well, were established for the first time, and such a battery is capable of driving two Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER systems in series based on the above Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling, for the self&#8208;powered efficient hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, such a Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling enables the preparation of a multifunctional catalyst, named as Pt&#8208;3@SXNS (siloxene nanosheet), by Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted Pt nanoparticles dispersing on SXNS, which could be alternatively obtained by Fe3+RR&#8208;assisted exfoliation using Fe3+ from the anolyte of Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER. Such a Pt&#8208;3@SXNS catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities toward Fe3+RR in the Zn&#8208;Fe flow battery, HER and Fe2+OR in the electrolyzer, which is attributed to the strong electron interaction between Pt and Si. This work offers a new strategy for energy storage and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from the acidic wastewater.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Cu+ via Strong Electronic Interaction for Selective and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper oxide&#8208;based materials effectively electrocatalyze carbon dioxide reduction (CO  2  RR). To comprehend their role and achieve high CO  2  RR activity, Cu  +  in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu  2  O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu  +  . The C  2  H  4  /CO ratio increased 1.62&#8208;fold in the CO  2  RR with Cu  2  O&#8208;BN compared to that with Cu  2  O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu  2  O&#8208;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8208;O bonds. Electrophilic h&#8208;BN receives partial electron density from Cu  2  O, protecting the Cu&#8208;O bonds from electron attack during the CO  2  RR and stabilizing the Cu  +  species during long&#8208;term electrolysis. The well&#8208;retained Cu  +  species enhanced the C  2  product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu  2  O&#8208;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal&#8208;valence&#8208;state&#8208;dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Resolution of Helical Building Block through the Formation of Homochiral Helices in Two Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous resolution leading to conglomerate crystals remains a significant challenge. Here we propose to form orthogonal homochiral supramolecular helices in at least two dimensions to allow the spontaneous resolution. A designing rationale is accordingly suggested that the chiral species is made into helical building blocks to allow the helix formation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept, acetylalanine was chosen to be made into a helical short azapeptide, its  N  &#8208;amidothiourea derivative containing a &#946;&#8208;turn structure, to which a halogen atom was further introduced at the phenylthiourea aromatic ring. The resultant folded species is therefore enabled to undergo both the intermolecular hydrogen and halogen bonding across the turn structure to form orthogonal intermolecular hydrogen bonded and halogen bonded supramolecular helices in two dimensions, respectively, and undergoes chiral resolution upon crystallization. While their counterpart containing an F&#8208;substituent of weak halogen bonding or no halogen atom, crystallizes in the racemic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cobalamin&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzes the Unique C&#945;&#8208;Methylation of Glutamine in Methyl&#8208;Coenzyme M Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase, which is responsible for the production of the greenhouse gas methane during biological methane formation, carries several unique posttranslational amino acid modifications, inter alia a 2&#8208;(S)&#8208;methylglutamine. The enzyme responsible for the C&#945;&#8208;methylation of this glutamine is not known. Here, we identify and characterize a cobalamin&#8208;dependent Radical SAM enzyme as the glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase. The recombinant protein from Methanoculleus thermophilus binds cobalamin in a base&#8208;off, His&#8208;off conformation and contains a single [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster. The cobalamin cofactor cycles between the methyl&#8208;cob(III)alamin, cob(II)alamin and cob(I)alamin states during catalysis and produces methylated substrate, 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine in a 1:1:1 ratio. The newly identified glutamine C&#8209;methyltransferase belongs to the class B of Radical SAM methyltransferases known to catalyze challenging methylation reactions of sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries towards Highly Functional Exsolved Catalyst for Dry Reforming of Methane under A Dilution&#8208;Free System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been emerging as a viable solution to achieving carbon neutrality enhanced by the Paris Agreement as it converts the greenhouse gases of CO  2  and CH  4  into industrially useful syngas. However, there have been limited studies on the DRM catalyst under mild operating conditions with a high dilution gas ratio due to their deactivation from carbon coking and metal sintering. Herein, we apply the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) concept to DRM catalyst via exsolution phenomenon that can secure elongated TPB by controlling the Fe&#8208;doping ratio in perovskite oxide. Remarkably, the exsolved catalyst with prolongated TPB shows exceptional CO  2  and CH  4  conversion rates of 95.9% and 91.6%, respectively, stable for 1000 hours under a dilution&#8208;free system. DFT calculations confirm that the Lewis acid of support and Lewis base of metal at the TPB promote the adsorption of reactants, resulting in lowering the overall CO  2  dissociation and CH  4  dehydrogenation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dismutation of Tricyanoboryllead Compounds: The Homoleptic Tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyanoborylplumbate anions have been obtained and isolated as thermally robust salts. The tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722; was obtained from [EtPbB(CN)3]&#8722; by stepwise dismutation in water or hydrochloric acid via [Et2Pb{B(CN)3}2]2&#8722; and [EtPb{B(CN)3}3]3&#8722;.







Abstract
A series of unprecedently air&#8208;stable (tricyanoboryl)plumbate anions was obtained by the reaction of the boron&#8208;centered nucleophile B(CN)32&#8722; with triorganyllead halides. Salts of the anions [R3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; (R=Ph, Et) were isolated and found to be stable in air at room temperature. In the case of Me3PbHal (Hal=Cl, Br), a mixture of the anions [Me4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1, 2) was obtained. The [Et3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; ion undergoes stepwise dismutation in aqueous solution to yield the plumbate anions [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1&#8211;4) and PbEt4 as by&#8208;product. The reaction rate increases with decreasing pH value of the aqueous solution or by bubbling O2 through the reaction mixture. Adjustment of the conditions allowed the selective formation and isolation of salts of all anions of the series [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=2&#8211;4) including the homoleptic tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722;.

         <title>Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type&#8197;II Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The global distribution and structural diversity of bacterial aromatic polyketides were assessed by pan&#8208;genomic analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. Such a global atlas will guide genome mining efforts to fully exploit natural products, as exemplified by the discovery of the unusual angular naphthopyrans from a rare actinobacterium.







Abstract
Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large&#8208;scale analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type&#8197;II polyketide synthase&#8208;derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing a Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Grubbs&#8208;type complexe containing macrocyclic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand with two small aryl arms tied together was obtained and characterised. Interestingly, it can exist in two forms, cis and trans. Both of them exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis, however both can be used in difficult metathesis reactions, also leading to the formation of tetrasubstituted double bonds.







Abstract
Formation of sterically hindered C&#8722;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkyl chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis&#8208;arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;Type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, anionic cyanines are designed as the phototherapy agents by controlling their aggregates through counterion engineering. The resulting J&#8208;type aggregate nanoparticles show NIR emission, high photostability, negatively charge surface, mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, and significantly enhanced singlet oxygen generation efficiency, leading to efficient antitumor phototherapy efficacy.







Abstract
Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in the biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on a tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant 5&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable in vivo antitumor phototheranostic efficacy, making them have a potential for clinical use.

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong&#8208;binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA facilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA dehybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.

&lt;p&gt;The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong-binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inorganic Chiral Hybrid Nanostructures for Tailored Chiroptics and Chirality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of chiral hybrid nanostructures comprising chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and functional semiconductors are constructed via a general synthesis. The obtained hybrids show new and tunable chiroptical activity, and exhibit chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance of water splitting under circularly polarized light, paving the way for complex chiral nanostructures and new chiral light&#8211;matter interactions.







Abstract
Inorganic chiral hybrid nanostructures that embed chirality within distinct material compositions can create novel chiral properties and functionalities absent from achiral nanostructures; however, they remain largely unexplored. We report, for the first time, a class of chiral plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor core&#8208;shell nanostructures that employ structurally chiral nanoparticles as chirality inducing templates to grow functional shell materials, which allowed us to independently control material parameters such as core geometry and shell thickness, as well as handedness of the system. We experimentally and theoretically achieved enhanced and tunable chiroptical activity of the heterostructures as a result of the core&#8208;shell strong coupling effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we demonstrate that the chiral hybrid nanostructures can drive chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic hydrogen generation under circularly polarized light. This study enables rational design and functionalization of chiral hybrid nanomaterials towards enhanced chiral light&#8211;matter interactions and chiral device applications.

         <title>Sustained Release of a Synthetic Autoinducing Peptide Mimetic Blocks Bacterial Communication and Virulence In Vivo.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic peptide was found to block cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signalling, or quorum sensing, in bacteria and be highly bioavailable in mouse tissue. The controlled release of this agent from degradable polymeric microparticles strongly inhibited skin infection in a wound model at levels that far surpassed the potency of the peptide when delivered conventionally.







Abstract
There is significant interest in approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections that block virulence without creating selective pressures that lead to resistance. Here, we report the development of an &#8220;anti&#8208;virulence&#8221; strategy that exploits the activity of potent synthetic inhibitors of quorum sensing (QS) in Staphylococcus aureus. We identify peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of QS that are resistant to sequestration or degradation by components of murine tissue and demonstrate that encapsulation of a lead inhibitor in degradable polymer microparticles provides materials that substantially inhibit QS in vitro. Using a murine abscess model, we show that this inhibitor attenuates methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) skin infections in vivo, and that sustained release of the inhibitor from microparticles significantly improved outcomes compared to mice that received a single&#8208;dose bolus. Our results present an effective and modular approach to controlling bacterial virulence in vivo and could advance the development of new strategies for skin infection control.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Expeditious Synthesis of Diblock Copolymers with Different Morphologies by Lewis Pair Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful application of Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly enabled the expeditious, single&#8208;step synthesis of well&#8208;defined diblock copolymeric nano&#8208;assemblies with different morphologies from acrylate and methacrylate mixture in minutes.







Abstract
Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its unique advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct a frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control (CSC) copolymerization and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.

         <dc:description>
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides using equivalent amounts of amines has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. The method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated and unreactive N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, representing a powerful new activation mode of unactivated amide bonds.







Abstract
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. Most crucially, the method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, thus reverting the classical order of reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives. This method provides a direct route to amide&#8208;to&#8208;amide bond interconversion with excellent chemoselectivity using equivalent amounts of amines. The combination of acid and iodide has been identified as the essential factor to activate the amide C&#8722;N bond through electrophilic catalytic activation, enabling the production of new desired transamidated products with wide substrate scope of both unactivated amides and amines, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs (&gt;80&#8197;examples). We anticipate that this powerful activation mode of unactivated amide bonds will find broad&#8208;ranging applications in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective desymmetrization route to [3]&#8208;ladderanol has been devised that is centered around an organocatalytic enantioselective formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of tetracyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenedione. This strategy involving the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality offers flexibility and enabled the facile synthesis of both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue.

Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of natural ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.

The use of strained bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) for the synthesis of a library of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone scaffolds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective C&#8722;C activation is described. Both experimental and DFT studies provided insights into the crucial stabilizing effect of base additives on the palladium&#8208;carbon intermediates.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective coupling of readily available bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) with various halides is reported, which offers expedient approaches to a wide range of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone skeletons via single or double C&#8722;C activation. The chemistry shows a broad substrate scope in terms of both the range of BCP&#8722;OH and halides including a series of natural product derivatives. Moreover, dependency of reaction chemodivergence on base additive has been investigated through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, which is expected to significantly enrich the reaction modes and increase the synthetic potential of BCP&#8722;OH in preparing more complex molecules.

         <title>Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as hydrogen donor is very challenging for hydrogen atom transfer reaction. Compared with gCN, the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) shows the activation of H&#8722;O bonds in water under visible light irradiation, thus rendering water as hydrogen donor for multiple reductions involving a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step and the oxidation of water to H2O2.







Abstract
Employing pure water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor to initiate chemical reactions that involve a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is fascinating but challenging due to its large H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy (BDEH&#8208;O=5.1&#8197;eV). Many approaches have been explored to stimulate water for hydrogenative reactions, but the efficiency and productivity still require significant enhancement. Here, we show that the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate H&#8722;O bonds in water, enabling abstraction of hydrogen atoms via dehydrogenation of pure water into hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation. The gCN&#8722;OH presents a stable catalytic performance for hydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling, pinacol&#8208;type coupling and dehalogenative C&#8722;C coupling, all with high yield and efficiency, even under solar radiation, featuring extensive impacts in using renewable energy for a cleaner process in dye, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Hydrophobization Engineering of the Air&#8211;Cathode Catalyst for Improved Oxygen Diffusion towards Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic&#8208;inspired hydrophobization engineering of electrocatalysts is developed to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion on an air cathode, achieving enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency toward zinc&#8211;air battery with higher energy density in comparison with that employing the air cathode without hydrophobic surface design.







Abstract
Poor oxygen diffusion at multiphase interfaces in an air cathode suppresses the energy densities of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Developing effective strategies to tackle the issue is of great significance for overcoming the performance bottleneck. Herein, inspired by the bionics of diving flies, a polytetrafluoroethylene layer was coated on the surfaces of Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon cloth (CC) to create a hydrophobic surface to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion, rendering the hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode a higher limiting current density (214&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V) than that (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode. Consequently, the assembled ZAB employing hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode acquired a higher power density (171&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) than that (102&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) utilizing untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode, proving the enhanced interfacial reaction kinetics on air cathode benefiting from the hydrophobization engineering.

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions to shorten and lengthen the conjugation between oligoaryl alkene units of aggregation&#8208;induced emitters toggle between rapid photocyclization and efficient photoluminescence properties. Trienes are resistant to photocyclization, giving them higher photoluminescence quantum yields, whereas nonconjugated aryl alkene units cyclize readily to form extended polycyclic frameworks.







Abstract
Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkene chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular N2 was directly fixed into arylamines in a plasma&#8211;liquid system at ambient temperature and pressure without transition metal mediation, which provides a green alternative to the hazardous multistep processes as practiced in the traditional method for large&#8208;scale arylamine production.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8722;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N2) is of great interest but remains a challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8211;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly couple benzene and N2, two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45&#8201;% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N2 (A3
) and N2+ species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing the plasma reactor, the realization of cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N2 could become reality.

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications**
</title>

Porphyrin derivatives that can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence (PL) over 60&#8197;min are reported and a mechanism for the phenomenon is proposed. The derivatives are used to synthesize supramolecular probes with peroxynitrite&#8208;activated PL and light&#8208;triggered imaging&#8208;modality transformation characteristics that permit improved biological uses.







Abstract
Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60&#8197;min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.

         <title>Tuning an Imine Reductase for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Azacycloalkylamines by Concise Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided engineering of an imine reductase IR&#8208;G36 gave a final variant M5 for reductive amination, enabling the asymmetric synthesis of a series of azacycloalkylamines with up to 47&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate loadings and up to 99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Crystal structures of IR&#8208;G36 and computational studies shed light on the structural basis for the performance improvement.







Abstract
Although imine reductases (IREDs) are emerging as attractive reductive aminases (RedAms), their substrate scope is still narrow, and rational engineering is rare. Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2&#8201;&#176;C improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78&#8201;% (R) to &gt;99&#8201;% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.

         <title>Sustaining Electron Transfer Pathways Extends Biohybrid Photoelectrode Stability to Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The viability of biohybrid technologies is primarily limited by the inherent fragility of the biological component. The operational stability of photoproteins adsorbed to mesoporous ITO electrodes is prolonged to 33&#8197;days under intense illumination, and 28&#8197;months in storage, demonstrating the feasibility of protein&#8208;based devices that last years.







Abstract
The exploitation of natural photosynthetic enzymes in semi&#8208;artificial devices constitutes an attractive and potentially sustainable route for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and solar fuels. However, the stability of photosynthetic proteins after incorporation in a biohybrid architecture typically limits the operational lifetime of biophotoelectrodes to a few hours. Here, we demonstrate ways to greatly enhance the stability of a mesoporous electrode coated with the RC&#8208;LH1 photoprotein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. By preserving electron transfer pathways, we extended operation under continuous high&#8208;light to 33&#8197;days, and operation after storage to over two years. Coupled with large photocurrents that reached peak values of 4.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the optimized biophotoelectrode produced a cumulative output of 86&#8197;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the largest reported performance to date. Our results demonstrate that the factor limiting stability is the architecture surrounding the photoprotein, and that biohybrid sensors and photovoltaic devices with operational lifetimes of years are feasible.

         <title>Selective Extraction of Transition Metals from Spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 Cathode via Regulation of Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep eutectic solvent composed of choline chloride and oxalic acid was prepared. After leaching at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 10&#8197;hours, the nickel oxalate dihydrate and the filtrate containing other metal elements are separated. Then the filtrate is diluted with water to precipitate the cobalt oxalate dihydrate. Finally, manganese compounds were separated by adjusting pH.







Abstract
The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1&#8201;%, 95.1&#8201;%, and 95.3&#8201;%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the battery recycling industry.

&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with high recovery yields of 99.1&#8201;%, 95.1&#8201;%, and 95.3&#8201;%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well-designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine-tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the battery recycling industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for fabrication of highly loaded supercapacitors. Coupling with controllable capillary densification, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.







Abstract
Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging. In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time. The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity. Furthermore, simultaneous in situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8211;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics. As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu nanoparticles enhances transmetalation and phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu surface to the Pd surface by low&#8208;flux visible light. This feature enables a choice between the cross&#8208;coupling product and homo&#8208;coupling product dependent on wavelength.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8722;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940&#8197;nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.

         <title>Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Chiral Cyclic and Acyclic gem&#8208;Difluoromethylenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and cyclic or acyclic gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones enabled the synthesis of chiral gem&#8208;difluoromethylene compounds. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was the key to providing high yield products with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene moieties are attractive in medicinal chemistry due to their ability to mimic other more ubiquitous functional groups. Thus, effective asymmetric methods for their construction are highly desirable, especially for the industrial production of chiral drugs. Using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones, we were able to easily access chiral 1,3&#8208;dioxanes that contain a tetrasubstituted difluoroalkyl stereogenic center in cyclic and acyclic skeletons. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was developed to provide the products in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity. Strikingly, the gem&#8208;difluoro substitution pattern promotes the reaction, and pentafluoroethylketone, an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketoester, and a &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone are suitable substrates for this method.

         <title>Fusion of Multi&#8208;Resonance Fragment with Conventional Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon for Nearly BT.2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise synthetic fusion of a multi&#8208;resonance fragment with a conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), ultrapure green BN&#8208;ICz emitters were successfully constructed. The optimal bottom&#8208;emitting OLED exhibits a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 with a high EQE of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieves the BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78), but also shows a leading performance with current efficiency up to 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general strategy for achieving ultra&#8208;pure green emissions by suppressing the shoulder peaks in the emission spectra of conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Through precise synthetic fusion of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters exhibited ultra&#8208;pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99&#8201;%, a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Unprecedented Mushroom Polyketide Synthases Produce the Universal Anthraquinone Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Pre&#8208;)Anthraquinones are a diverse class of bioactive natural products. Dissimilar to plants, molds, and bacteria, the webcaps, one of the most species&#8208;rich genera of mushrooms, use an evolutionarily distinct class of remarkably small polyketide synthases to produce atrochyrsone carboxylic acid, the universal precursor of (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones. These enzymes represent an outstanding example of convergent evolution of biosynthetic capacities.







Abstract
(Pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are widely distributed natural compounds and occur in plants, fungi, microorganisms, and animals, with atrochrysone (1) as the key biosynthetic precursor. Chemical analyses established mushrooms of the genus Cortinarius&#8212;the webcaps&#8212;as producers of atrochrysone&#8208;derived octaketide pigments. However, more recent genomic data did not provide any evidence for known atrochrysone carboxylic acid (4) synthases nor any other polyketide synthase (PKS) producing oligocyclic metabolites. Here, we describe an unprecedented class of non&#8208;reducing (NR&#8208;)PKS. In vitro assays with recombinant enzyme in combination with in vivo product formation in the heterologous host Aspergillus niger established CoPKS1 and CoPKS4 of C.&#160;odorifer as members of a new class of atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthases. CoPKS4 catalyzed both hepta&#8208; and octaketide synthesis and yielded 6&#8208;hydroxymusizin (6), along with 4. These first mushroom PKSs for oligocyclic products illustrate how the biosynthesis of bioactive natural metabolites evolved independently in various groups of life.

         <title>Digitizing Chemical Synthesis in 3D Printed Reactionware</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines reactions as building blocks with 3D printed reactor hardware or reactionware is presented. This practical approach allows the synthetic chemist to encode the unit operations allowing a digital blueprint to be built of the entire process.







Abstract
Chemistry digitization requires an unambiguous link between experiments and the code used to generate the experimental conditions and outcomes, yet this process is not standardized, limiting the portability of any chemical code. What is needed is a universal approach to aid this process using a well&#8208;defined standard that is composed of syntheses that are employed in modular hardware. Herein we present a new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines process chemistry principles with 3D printed reactionware. This approach outlines the process for transforming unit operations into digitized hardware and well&#8208;defined instructions that ensure effective synthesis. To demonstrate this, we outline the process for digitizing 3 MIDA boronate building blocks, an ester hydrolysis, a Wittig olefination, a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction, and synthesis of the drug sulfanilamide.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen over PdCu/Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdCu/zeolite exhibited promising catalytic performance for selective oxidation of CH4 to oxygenates with O2 and H2 via tandem catalysis. The PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2, while Cu single atoms activated the H2O2 and facilitated the direct conversion of CH4 to CH3OH by a radical&#8208;triggered pathway.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates with O2 under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Here we report a ZSM&#8208;5 (Z&#8208;5) supported PdCu bimetallic catalyst (PdCu/Z&#8208;5) for methane conversion to oxygenates by reacting with O2 in the presence of H2 at low temperature (120&#8201;&#176;C). Benefiting from the co&#8208;existence of PdO nanoparticles and Cu single atoms via tandem catalysis, the PdCu/Z&#8208;5 catalyst exhibited a high oxygenates yield of 1178&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1Pd&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95&#8201;%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2 from O2 and H2, while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H2O2 for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) from H2O2 decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH4 by &#8901;OH to methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3). Subsequently, the &#8901;OH reacted quickly with the &#8901;CH3 to form CH3OH with high selectivity.

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery is constructed with an electrocatalyst&#8208;assisted sulfur positive electrode and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The electrocatalyst accelerates the sulfur conversion and the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfide, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a high energy density and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8211;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries of ultrahigh energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst&#8208;boosting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery, which involves a sulfur&#8208;anchored cobalt/nitrogen co&#8208;doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;impregnated metal&#8211;organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co&#8722;N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al&#8722;Cl and S&#8722;S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43&#8197;V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9&#8197;V. In the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al&#8722;S battery to deliver 820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific capacity and 78&#8201;% capacity retention after 300&#8197;cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al&#8722;S batteries for stable energy storage.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;(carbone) Pincer Ligand and Its Coordinative Behavior toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer ligand was prepared and its structural characterization reported. With a total of five electron pairs available, this new pincer framework was studied for its coordinative behavior, enabling the formation of trinuclear heterometallic complexes.







Abstract
Carbones are divalent carbon(0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This bis&#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8722;Pd&#8722;Au, Au&#8722;Ni&#8722;Au, and Cu&#8722;Ni&#8722;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8211;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the bis&#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.

     alt="A Bis-(carbone) Pincer Ligand and Its Coordinative Behavior toward Multi-Metallic Configurations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable &lt;i&gt;bis-&lt;/i&gt;(carbone) pincer ligand was prepared and its structural characterization reported. With a total of five electron pairs available, this new pincer framework was studied for its coordinative behavior, enabling the formation of trinuclear heterometallic complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbones are divalent carbon(0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-(carbone) pincer framework with a well-defined solid-state structure. This &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8722;Pd&#8722;Au, Au&#8722;Ni&#8722;Au, and Cu&#8722;Ni&#8722;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum-theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8211;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi-metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cycloisomerization/Cross&#8208;Coupling of Carbonyl&#8208; and Imine&#8208;Tethered Alkylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalytic system is reported for the divergent tandem cycloisomerization and cross&#8208;coupling of carbonyl&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs). The selection of ancillary ligands is pivotal for the interception of the heteropalladacyclic intermediates with different external nucleophiles.







Abstract
Pd0 catalysts featuring phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization/cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8722;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP's is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.

         <title>Organic Four&#8208;Electron Redox Systems Based on Bipyridine and Phenanthroline Carbene Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel four&#8208;electron redox&#8208;systems featuring up to five isolable oxidation states are presented. The synthesis is modular and based on the combination of diquat or phenanthrolinium salts with stable carbenes. The different oxidation states can be isolated and feature diradical and mixed valence states. Charge/discharge experiments confirm that these redox systems are promising new lead structures for two&#8208;electron anolyte materials.







Abstract
Novel organic redox systems that display multistage redox behaviour are highly sought&#8208;after for a series of applications such as organic batteries or electrochromic materials. Here we describe a simple strategy to transfer well&#8208;known two&#8208;electron redox active bipyridine and phenanthroline architectures into novel strongly reducing four&#8208;electron redox systems featuring fully reversible redox events with up to five stable oxidation states. We give spectroscopic and structural insight into the changes involved in the redox&#8208;events and present characterization data on all isolated oxidation states. The redox&#8208;systems feature strong UV/Vis/NIR polyelectrochromic properties such as distinct strong NIR absorptions in the mixed valence states. Two&#8208;electron charge&#8211;discharge cycling studies indicate high electrochemical stability at strongly negative potentials, rendering the new redox architectures promising lead structures for multi&#8208;electron anolyte materials.

         <title>Tailored Pyridoxal Probes Unravel Novel Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Targets and Antibiotic Hits in Critical Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented targets are needed to fight the bacterial pandemic. A suite of pyridoxal probes that infiltrate the cellular metabolism of critical pathogens and get incorporated in pyridoxal&#8208;phosphate dependent enzymes is applied. Chemoproteomics facilitated the functional characterization of previously unknown members and the identification of essential targets with antibiotic hit molecules.







Abstract
Unprecedented bacterial targets are urgently needed to overcome the resistance crisis. Herein we systematically mine pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes (PLP&#8208;DEs) in bacteria to focus on a target class which is involved in crucial metabolic processes. For this, we tailored eight pyridoxal (PL) probes bearing modifications at various positions. Overall, the probes exceeded the performance of a previous generation and provided a detailed map of PLP&#8208;DEs in clinically relevant pathogens including challenging Gram&#8208;negative strains. Putative PLP&#8208;DEs with unknown function were exemplarily characterized via in&#8208;depth enzymatic assays. Finally, we screened a panel of PLP binders for antibiotic activity and unravelled the targets of hit molecules. Here, an uncharacterized enzyme, essential for bacterial growth, was assigned as PLP&#8208;dependent cysteine desulfurase and confirmed to be inhibited by the marketed drug phenelzine. Our approach provides a basis for deciphering novel PLP&#8208;DEs as essential antibiotic targets along with corresponding ways to decipher small molecule inhibitors.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymers with Fluorine&#8208;Induced Favorable Molecular Stacking Enable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) was explored, featuring fluorine&#8208;substituted pyrene and specific Pb&#8722;Se secondary interactions. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM, afforded an excellent PCE of 22.3&#8201;%, positioning it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with the perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both the HTM layer and the perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3&#8201;% and the dramatically enhanced device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Catalytic Degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate Using a Phase&#8208;Transitional Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 catalyzes the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomers. During the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 transforms into another Zr&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;140 which also shows good catalytic reactivity for the degradation of PET.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is utilized as one of the most popular consumer plastics worldwide, but difficulties associated with recycling PET have generated a severe environmental crisis with most PET ending its lifecycle in landfills. We report that zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 deconstructs waste PET into the building blocks terephthalic acid (TA) and mono&#8208;methyl terephthalate (MMT) within 24&#8197;hours at 260&#8201;&#176;C (total yield of 98&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm H2 and 81&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm Ar). Extensive structural characterization studies reveal that during the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 undergoes an intriguing transformation into MIL&#8208;140A, which is another Zr&#8208;MOF that shows good catalytic activity toward PET degradation under similar reaction conditions. These results illustrate the diversity of applications for Zr&#8208;MOFs and establish MOFs as a new class of polymer degradation catalysts with the potential to address long&#8208;standing challenges associated with plastic waste.

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing fluorophores based on aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission into supramolecular monomers, the molecular weight and fluorescence color of supramolecular polymers can be linked. In this system, with the increasing molecular weight, the fluorescence color changed from dark blue to yellow&#8208;green concurrently, thus enabling the visual differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer M1 with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing M1 concentration (0.100&#8211;100&#8197;mM), the average degree of polymerization (DPDOSY) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DPDOSY and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing a competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Inside Cover: Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 24/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as a hydrogen source to perform chemical reactions is fascinating but challenging because of the high H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy of water (ca. 5&#8197;eV). Tingbin Lim, Ren Su, and co&#8208;workers show in their Research Article (e202204256) that surface&#8208;hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate water for reactions involving a hydrogen atom transfer step, allowing solar&#8208;driven eco&#8208;friendly synthetic chemistry.

Enhancement of the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles by depleting membrane cholesterol is demonstrated by Weiwei&#8197;Gao, Liangfang Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202203115). Increased membrane permeability, caused by the reduction in cholesterol level, is likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. This discovery broadens the use of these biomimetic nanoparticles in drug delivery and biodetoxification.

The global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides is reported by Lihan Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202202286). By pan&#8208;genomic analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases, the global distribution, abundance, and structural diversity of the aromatic polyketides were assessed. The study also provides insight for the molecular evolution of aromatic polyketides and serves as a compass for future discoveries of this class of natural products.

Are photoproteins stable enough for operation in real world technologies? The Research Article (e202201148) by Vincent&#8197;M. Friebe, Raoul&#8197;N. Frese, and co&#8208;workers pushes the operation of a biohybrid photoelectrode to new lengths. By stabilizing the pathways crucial for electron transfer, it was possible to prolong electrode operation to the equivalent of a full year of solar insolation in the Netherlands, as well as to maintain output after storage for 2.5&#8197;years. These findings will be instrumental for realizing photoprotein&#8208;based technologies such as biosensors or biophotovoltaics.

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection Using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various signal transduction strategies that are employed in chemical and biological sensing with DNA&#8208;based nanostructures are the focus of this Minireview. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these different methods are also discussed and the considerations that determine the ideal strategy for a given application are delineated.







Abstract
The use of DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes has led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA's inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in constructing photocatalysts based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) heterojunctions, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, which show improved carrier separation and accelerated surface reaction rates for efficient solar energy conversion are discussed systematically in this Review. Techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are also evaluated and challenges and future directions highlighted.







Abstract
With fascinating photophysical properties and a strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.

         <title>Reversing a Platinum Micromotor by Introducing Platinum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced during the sputter&#8208;coating of Pt films by O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the swimming direction of a micromotor by self&#8208;electrophoresis.







Abstract
Understanding and controlling the swimming direction of a synthetic nano&#8208; and micromotor holds fundamental and applied significance. Here, we focus on platinum&#8208;containing Janus colloids that catalytically decompose H2O2 into O2, an archetypical model of chemical micromotor. We discover that platinum oxides (primarily PtO) are produced on Pt films sputter&#8208;coated in O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the motor possibly by self&#8208;electrophoresis. Using this knowledge, micromotors moving in either direction were fabricated by intentionally introducing or removing PtO. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that a Pt micromotor is powered by Pt alone, and open up new avenues for controlling the swimming directions of a micro&#8208; and nanomachine.

         <title>Functionalized Acyclic (l)&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Four&#8208;Way Junction with High Stability In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligonucleotide analogue (l)&#8208;aTNA forms a highly stable four&#8208;way junction, which is used to assemble multiple components conjugated to the short (l)&#8208;aTNA strands. This represents a modular approach to assemble multifunctional drug structures. The cellular targeting of a structure containing a HER2 nanobody is shown in vitro and the circulation of a fatty acid functionalized structure is shown in vivo.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection material to assemble molecules and proteins in well&#8208;defined structures. For the application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non&#8208;toxic, and non&#8208;immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic l&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four&#8208;way junction (4WJ) that is highly stable and enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The aTNA 4WJ is serum&#8208;stable, shows no non&#8208;targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with a cancer&#8208;targeting and a serum half&#8208;life extension moiety and show the effect of these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic Generation and Accumulation of Triplet Excitons for Efficient Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of generation and accumulation of triplet excitons, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh), which exhibits a fast rate of intersystem crossing and a small energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers.







Abstract
The traditional method to achieve ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is to hybrid n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* configurations in appropriate proportion, which are contradictory to each other for improving efficiency and lifetime of phosphorescence. In this work, through replacing the electron&#8208;donating aromatic group with a methoxy group and combining intramolecular halogen bond to promote intersystem crossing and suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh) has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers. As compared to CzS2Br, which has a similar substituted position of bromine atom and a larger kisc (the rate of intersystem crossing), the smaller &#916;ETT* (the energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence) in 2Br&#8208;OSPh could accelerate the transition from T1 to T1*. This research indicates that both generation and accumulation of triplet excitons play an important role in realizing efficient UOP materials.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Vinylcyclopropanes with Imines for the Synthesis of Chiral Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropanes are important synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. In this study, the first phosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines was achieved, which led to the formation of a range of highly functionalized pyrrolidines in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective and diastereoselective (up to 98&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines has been developed, which allows facile access to a range of highly functionalized chiral pyrrolidines. Notably, this method makes use of vinylcyclopropanes as a synthon for phosphine&#8208;mediated asymmetric annulation reaction, which will offer new opportunities for potential applications of cyclopropanes substrates in phosphine&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations.

         <title>An Anionic Dinuclear Ruthenium Dihydrogen Complex of Relevance for Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic and neutral non&#8208;classical &#963;&#8208;H2 complexes are plentiful, but anionic ones remain exceedingly rare. It was during an investigation into the fate of a Ru&#8208;precatalyst in the light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation that such a species was encountered, which seems to be &#8220;first&#8208;in&#8208;class&#8221;: it lacks any substructures that counteract the negative charge and prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H&#8722;H bond from occurring.







Abstract
During an investigation into the fate of ruthenium precatalysts used for light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation reactions with formation of Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium catalysts, it was found that the reaction of [(IPr)(&#951;6&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] with H2 under UV&#8208;irradiation affords an anionic dinuclear &#963;&#8208;dihydrogen complex, which is thermally surprisingly robust. Not only are anionic &#963;&#8208;complexes in general exceedingly rare, but the newly formed species seems to be the first example lacking any structural attributes able to counterbalance the negative charge and, in so doing, prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H2 from occurring.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Endocyclic Allenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Annulation Followed by Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition and enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement is disclosed, affording chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Experimental and DFT calculation results rationalized the Cope rearrangement that allowed for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral endocyclic allenes remains a challenge in allene chemistry owing to unfavored tension and complex chirality. Here, we present a new relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation with enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement, providing a facile route to chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were performed to illustrate the critical, but unusual Cope rearrangement that allows for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Electrophilic Spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;Biphenylacetylene via Conformational Fixing within a Hollow&#8208;Cage Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;biphenyl acetylene was achieved by virtue of a spatial constraint in a self&#8208;assembled molecular cage. The unusual, folded conformation in the cavity alters the selectivity of the electrophilic cyclization from 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to form a hindered spiro compound. NBS= N&#8208;bromosuccinimide; NIS= N&#8208;iodosuccinimide.







Abstract
A 2&#8208;biphenylacetylene was fixed into a specific conformation within the confined cavity of a hollow cage, where it underwent a regioselective spirocyclization in the presence of an electrophile. A 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization proceeded selectively in the cage, which stands in sharp contrast to the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization that normally occurs in common organic media. The folded conformation adopted by the substrate within the cage was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.

         <title>Decarbonylative Transfer Hydrochlorination of Alkenes and Alkynes Based on a B(C6F5)3&#8208;Initiated Grob Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>

B(C6F5)3 initiates the Grob fragmentation of cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted acyl chlorides into a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, carbon monoxide and HCl. In the presence of &#960;&#8208;basic substrates such as alkenes and alkynes, HCl is transferred stepwise to afford the corresponding hydrochlorination products. The overall reaction is a decarbonylative transfer hydrochlorination driven by aromatization and carbon&#8208;monoxide release.







Abstract
Readily available cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;ylcarbonyl chloride derivatives are introduced as bench&#8208;stable HCl surrogates for transfer hydrochlorination of terminal and internal alkenes as well as selected alkynes. The stepwise Grob fragmentation of those acyl chlorides into chloride, carbon monoxide, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, and a proton is promoted by B(C6F5)3. This decarbonylative transfer process enables the addition of HCl across C&#8722;C double and triple bonds with Markovnikov selectivity at room temperature.

         <title>An Integrated Carbon Nitride&#8208;Nickel Photocatalyst for the Amination of Aryl Halides Using Sodium Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous photocatalytic method is reported for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using nickel deposited on a mesoporous carbon nitride material. This procedure removes the need for sophisticated ligands, precious metals, and elevated temperatures/pressures, and it takes place under mild reaction conditions with a recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of primary anilines via sustainable methods remains a challenge in organic synthesis. We report a photocatalytic protocol for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using a photocatalyst powder consisting of nickel(II) deposited on mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx). This heterogeneous photocatalyst contains a high surface area with a visible light&#8208;absorbing and adaptive &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; solid&#8208;state ligand for the integrated catalytic Ni site. The method displays a high functional group tolerance, requires mild reaction conditions, and benefits from easy recovery and reuse of the photocatalyst powder. Thereby, it overcomes the need of complex ligand scaffolds required in homogeneous catalysis, precious metals and elevated temperatures/pressures in existing protocols of primary anilines synthesis. The reported heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.

A catalytic asymmetric P&#8208;arylation of H&#8208;phosphinate was developed via an interesting dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation. The copper&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization provides a general method for the highly enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycles. The copper complex was responsible for the racemization of the H&#8208;phosphinates. H&#8208;Phenylphosphinates, H&#8208;alkenylphosphinate and H&#8208;alkylphosphinates were examined and delivered the products in high yields and high ee values.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aryl C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization reaction was successfully developed via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) under mild conditions. This study provides a general and simple method for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of stable six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus heterocycles with excellent enantioselectivities and moderate to high yields. One&#8208;pot gram&#8208;scale asymmetric synthesis of the P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycle from commercially available materials was also successfully accomplished with excellent enantioselectivity and high yield.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;Diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of methylene cyclopropanes allowed the synthesis of a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The structure complexity of 1,4&#8208;diamines was further increased by using two different functionalized amino agents. Mechanistic studies show a potential pathway involving the hydroamination ring&#8208;opening with &#946;&#8208;C elimination followed by a cascade hydroamination sequence.







Abstract
Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH2&#8208;Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring&#8208;opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution NMR H/D Exchange of Human Superoxide Dismutase Inclusion Bodies Reveals Significant Native Features Despite Structural Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Measurements of quenched hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange by NMR, FTIR, and Congo red binding provide a rare, high&#8208;resolution view of the inclusion body (IB) structure at the atomic level. Diverse mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) adopt remarkably similar IB structures comprising an ensemble with some amyloid&#8208;like structure together with extensive native&#8208;like conformations.







Abstract
Protein aggregation is central to aging, disease and biotechnology. While there has been recent progress in defining structural features of cellular protein aggregates, many aspects remain unclear due to heterogeneity of aggregates presenting obstacles to characterization. Here we report high&#8208;resolution analysis of cellular inclusion bodies (IBs) of immature human superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants using NMR quenched amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (qHDX), FTIR and Congo red binding. The extent of aggregation is correlated with mutant global stability and, notably, the free energy of native dimer dissociation, indicating contributions of native&#8208;like monomer associations to IB formation. This is further manifested by a common pattern of extensive protection against H/D exchange throughout nine mutant SOD1s despite their diverse characteristics. These results reveal multiple aggregation&#8208;prone regions in SOD1 and illuminate how aggregation may occur via an ensemble of pathways.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation for the Synthesis of C&#8208;Glycoamino Acids and C&#8208;Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation reaction was developed for the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide.







Abstract
The glycosylative modification of peptides could improve the pharmacological properties of peptide drugs and deliver them efficiently to the target sites. Compared with O&#8208;/N&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycosides exhibit more metabolic stability. We here disclose the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide, and are amenable to the synthesis of a wide variety of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The dual&#8208;functional photocatalyst formed in situ via coordination of the glycine derivative and the chiral phosphine Cu complex could not only catalyze the photoredox process but also control the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction.

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on classical BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) have been achieved through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Remarkably, diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracene (DPBNA), with a highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and excellent performance in phototransistors, is the first BN&#8208;PAH that outperforms amorphous silicon.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8722;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl&#8208; and diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN&#8208;PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN&#8208;PAH with mobility over 1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance phototransistors based on DPBNA are also demonstrated, implying the high potential of BN&#8208;PAHs for optoelectronic applications when the &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy is implemented.

Template&#8208;induced complexity: LiBF4 induces the rearrangement of a homoleptic Pd2L4 complex into a Pd4L8 assembly. The complex shows a folded, highly compact structure, with a low apparent symmetry and two highly specific binding pockets.







Abstract
Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]4+ complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8211;guest interactions. A structural analysis of the [Pd4L8]8+ receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.

         <title>Identifying Crystallographically Different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in LTA Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of crystallographically different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted acid sites in LTA zeolites has been identified using IR and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This has been successfully rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.







Abstract
A clear understanding of the acidic properties of bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups containing crystallographically different oxygen atoms in zeolites is a prerequisite for optimizing their performance as industrial solid catalysts and developing new acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, but presents many challenges. Here, we report the direct observation of yet unrecognized bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups in the LTA zeolite whose oxygen atoms are crystallographically different from those of already known Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We also report that the creation of a crystallographically particular type of bridging OH groups in zeolites and its concentration and acid strength can vary strongly with the content and spatial distribution of framework Al atoms, thus being synthetic in nature, which has been rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.

&lt;p&gt;The existence of crystallographically different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted acid sites in LTA zeolites has been identified using IR and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This has been successfully rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Corrole&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers are synthesized and are more active and durable than metal corrole monomers for electrocatalytic O2 reduction and evolution reactions. By tuning the metal active site, the Co&#8208;based framework showed the highest activity among examined catalysts. With the benefits of using highly active metal corrole cores, this work presents unparalleled examples of metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Integrating molecular catalysts into designed frameworks often enables improved catalysis. Compared with porphyrin&#8208;based frameworks, metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. M&#8208;POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers, M&#8208;POPs displayed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Co&#8208;POP outperformed other M&#8208;POPs by achieving four&#8208;electron ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaching 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 340&#8197;mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based POPs as electrocatalysts.

         <title>Membrane Cholesterol Depletion Enhances Enzymatic Activity of Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (NPs) are used for enzyme delivery because of their unique biointerface and loading capabilities. It is demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of the NPs is negatively correlated to the level of cholesterol within the cell membranes, providing a facile and practical approach for the design of enzyme&#8208;loaded nanotherapeutics.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs) have been increasingly used to encapsulate therapeutic enzymes for delivery. To better interface these MOF NPs with biological systems, researchers have coated them with natural cell membranes, enabling biomimicking properties suitable for innovative biomedical applications. Herein, we report that the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs can be significantly enhanced by reducing membrane cholesterol content. We demonstrate such cholesterol&#8208;enzymatic activity correlation using zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 MOF NPs to encapsulate catalase, horseradish peroxidase, and organophosphate hydrolase, respectively. MOF NPs coated with membranes of human red blood cells or macrophages show similar outcomes, illustrating the broad applicability of this finding. The mechanistic investigation further reveals that reducing cholesterol levels effectively enhances membrane permeability likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. These results also imply a facile approach to tailoring the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs by simply tuning the membrane cholesterol level.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Paired Bright Heptamethine Fluorophores with NIR&#8208;II Excitation and Emission Enable Multiplexed Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) has absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm. A counterion&#8208;paired strategy was explored to improve the brightness of HCs in aqueous solution by reducing aggregation and polarization. Profiting from enhanced brightness and well&#8208;shaped absorption spectra, dual&#8208;color imaging based on NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission was performed in living mice for the first time.







Abstract
Photon excitation and emission at the NIR&#8208;II spectral window enable high&#8208;contrast deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging. However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategies to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime. Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm through a physical organic approach. A bulky counterion paired to HCs was found to elicit substantial improvements in absorptivity (7&#8208;fold), brightness (14&#8208;fold), and spectral profiles in water, addressing a notorious quenching problem of NIR&#8208;II cyanines due to aggregation and polarization. We demonstrated the utilities of HC1222 and HC1342 for high&#8208;contrast dual&#8208;color imaging of circulatory system, lymphatic structures, tumor, and organ function in living mice under 1120&#8197;nm and 1319&#8197;nm excitation, showing HCs as a promising platform for non&#8208;invasive bioimaging.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. The cyclic allylborate could be used in several organic transformations such as regioselective protonation, the allylation of electrophiles, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.







Abstract
The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B2pin2 using a copper catalyst. Several 1,3&#8208;dienes were converted to the corresponding cyclic allylborates in moderate to high yields. The cyclic allylborate obtained could be used in several organic transformations such as allylation of electrophiles and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.

In situ Raman spectroscopy and the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique elucidated the fact that the nature of alkali metal cations can significantly influence the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework derived NiFe(OOH) electrocatalyst, following the order of Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+.







Abstract
Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8722;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser&#8208;induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation&#8208;dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Two&#8208;Axis Systems by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Arene&#8208;Forming Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete stereochemical addressability for all atropisomeric enantio&#8208; and diastereomers is viable by converting diketo substrates with simultaneous control over two configurationally stable stereogenic axes. The atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems were prepared by the direct catalyst&#8208;controlled arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalyst with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.







Abstract
Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Starfish Cyclic Steroid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, the use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing glycosylation, the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicoside&#8197;A and D and sepositoside&#8197;A, have been synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
Starfishes have evolved with a special type of secondary metabolites, namely starfish saponins, to ward off various predators and parasites; among them, the starfish cyclic steroid glycosides stand out structurally, featuring a unique 16&#8208;membered ring formed by bridging the steroidal C3 and C6 with a trisaccharide. The rigid cyclic scaffold and the congested and vulnerable steroid&#8208;sugar etherate linkage present an unprecedented synthetic challenge. Here we report a collective total synthesis of the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicosides&#8197;A (1) and D (2) and sepositoside&#8197;A (3), with an innovative approach, which entails a de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a decisive ring&#8208;closing glycosylation under the mild gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

         <title>Intermolecular Carbosilylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins with C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) Bond Formation Involving Silylium&#8208;Ion Regeneration</title>

Sterically unhindered silylium ions can initiate the silylalkynylation of terminal alkenes with silylated phenylacetylene derivatives in a two&#8208;component reaction. These alkynylsilanes and the silylium&#8208;ion initiator form bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocations as the actual catalysts (gray box). This new carbosilylation enables the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond (see scheme).







Abstract
A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated, terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by the capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.

         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocathode prepared by attaching a molecular cobalt catalyst on a n+&#8208;p Si film coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibits 100&#8201;% selectivity and 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in aqueous media under simulated sunlight irradiation. The high performance benefits from CNTs as both a support platform for highly dispersed molecular active sites and an efficient mediator for charge transfer.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy=4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8722;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 2&#8197;h in a neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.

Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TON&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of zeolite&#8208;like crystalline porous organic materials, ZOF&#8208;1 with high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) is reported. It is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks.







Abstract
The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic crb net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the determination of the monomer order of sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules by making use of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS is described. This approach, which relies on the introduction of random chain cleavages within the macromolecular backbone, enabled the rapid chemical sequencing of abiotic macromolecules.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone via a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Benzo[c]cinnoline&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Transporting Materials with 3D Molecular Interaction Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design high&#8208;performance electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton exhibit an exceedingly high glass transition temperature, a fast electron mobility and outstanding electroluminescent performances in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).







Abstract
The academically widely used electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs) typically suffer from low glass transition temperatures (Tg) that could lead to poor device stability. Considering practical applications, we herein put forward a &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy to design high&#8208;performance ETMs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton have been proposed and synthesized by the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H homo&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;acylaniline as the key step. 2,9&#8208;diphenylbenzo[c]cinnoline (DPBZC) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions that feature a 3D architecture, which boosts Tg to exceedingly high 218&#8201;&#176;C with a fast electron mobility (&#956;e) of 6.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. DPBZC&#8208;based fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show outstanding electroluminescent performances with an external quantum efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% and a power efficiency as high as 70.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, which are superior to those of the devices with the commonly used ETMs.

         <title>Metal&#8594;Carbon Dative Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 24, June 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic system containing a phosphine and a carbenium ion as an L&#8208;type and Z&#8208;type ligand, respectively, readily complexes zero&#8208;valent Group 10 metals to form complexes featuring M&#8594;Ccarbenium dative bonds. The formation of these dative bonds is supported by structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies which show that, out of three metals, palladium is the least metallobasic.







Abstract
As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds. Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of Group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the &#947; position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;Ccarbenium interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.

A robust &#960;&#8208;stacked porous organic molecular framework selectively separates aromatics over cyclic aliphatics.







Abstract
Selective separation using porous adsorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional separation techniques. Stacked porous organic molecular frameworks (POMFs) capable of noncovalent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. Here we report a robust porous molecular crystal (TAPM&#8208;1), which is stabilized by multiple intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. With its long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking, TAPM&#8208;1 has excellent hydrophobicity, thermostability, recyclability, and high selectivity for aromatics over the corresponding cyclic aliphatics. This enables TAPM&#8208;1 to serve as the stationary phase in the high&#8208;resolution gas chromatographic separation of benzene and cyclohexane or toluene and methylcyclohexane.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Hydrazonium Initiators**
</title>

The metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with hydrazonium initiators ultilizing the principle of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis is demonstrated.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn&#8804;9.4&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) with relatively low dispersities (&#272;&#8804;1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.
