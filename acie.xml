      <title>An Open Microfluidic Chip for Continuous Sampling of Solute from a Turbulent Particle Suspension</title>
      <dc:description>High solids content complicates in situ analysis of chemical processing, biological suspensions, and environmental streams. In most cases, analytical methods require at least one pre&#8208;treatment step of a small volume of sample before a particle&#8208;free fluid can be analyzed. We have developed a continuous in situ sampler that can &#8220;sip&#8221; particle&#8208;free solution from a turbulent high solids content stream (a slurry). An open microfluidic chip with an extended slit opening shields the internal laminar flow from the turbulence outside. Unlike other open chips, our chip does not require close proximity to a solid surface and operates in turbulent environments for hours without maintenance. Two applications are demonstrated: monitoring iron (III) in a stirred slurry of mixed ore particles at high solids loading (4%wt) and paracetamol tablet dissolution profiles for two different formulations.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic Seeded Growth of Ag Nanoplates Confined in Shape&#8208;Deformable Spaces</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional templating synthesis confines the growth of seeds in rigid spaces to achieve faithful morphological replication. Herein, we explore the use of spherical shape&#8208;deformable polymeric nanoshells to regulate the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates. The flexible shells deform adaptively to accommodate the initial overgrowth of the seeds but restrict the growth in the directions where the shells are fully stretched, eventually producing nanoplates with an unconventional circular profile. The diameter of the final Ag nanoplates can be precisely predicted by stretching and flattering the nanoshells into a plate&#8208;like capsule while retaining their original internal surface area. Further, unlike conventional templates, the polymer shells eventually turn themselves into a conformal coating that binds to the surface of the full&#8208;grown Ag nanoplates and significantly enhances their stability against oxidative etching. We believe the unique feature of adaptive regulation offered by the deformable templates may provide many new opportunities for creating novel nanostructures while still maintaining the typical advantages of templating synthesis such as high uniformity, robustness, and scalability.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;switched reversible emulsification and demulsification of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water Pickering emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsions have been shown to be an excellent platform for interfacial catalysis. However, developing simple and efficient strategies to achieve the goal of product separation and catalyst and emulsifier recovery is still a challenge. Herein, we report for the first time the switchable transition between emulsification and demulsification triggered by UV and visible light in a novel class of light&#8208;responsive Pickering emulsions fabricated from Pd supported silica nanoparticles, azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant, n&#8208;octane and water. It is shown that light&#8208;switchable emulsification and demulsification of the Pickering emulsions is attributed to the adsorption of azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant on the surface of the nanoparticles and the light switched surface activity of the ionic liquid surfactant. This feature enables the Pickering emulsion to be used as an easily controlled micro&#8208;reactor with the functions of catalytic reaction, product separation as well as emulsifier and catalyst recycling. As an example, highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation of some unsaturated hydrocarbons at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been performed in this system, with product separation and emulsifier and catalyst re&#8208;use achievable in a simple way.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallographic analysis of NifB with a full complement of clusters: Structural insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion during nitrogenase cofactor assembly</title>
      <dc:description>NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of  Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum  NifB without (apo  Mt  NifB) and with (holo  Mt  NifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo  Mt  NifB contain a partial TIM barrel core; yet, unlike apo  Mt  NifB that is structurally disordered outside the TIM barrel, holo  Mt  NifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. Of the three [Fe4S4] clusters in holo  Mt  NifB, the canonical radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster, like those in other radical SAM enzymes, is coordinated by three Cys ligands; whereas the adjacently positioned K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys ligands. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with  in silico  docking of SAM in holo  Mt  NifB, suggests plausible binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of  Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum  NifB without (apo  Mt  NifB) and with (holo  Mt  NifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo  Mt  NifB contain a partial TIM barrel core; yet, unlike apo  Mt  NifB that is structurally disordered outside the TIM barrel, holo  Mt  NifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. Of the three [Fe4S4] clusters in holo  Mt  NifB, the canonical radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster, like those in other radical SAM enzymes, is coordinated by three Cys ligands; whereas the adjacently positioned K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys ligands. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with  in silico  docking of SAM in holo  Mt  NifB, suggests plausible binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chemoproteomics&#8208;Enabled De Novo Discovery of Photoswitchable Carboxylesterase Inhibitors for Optically Controlled Drug Metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones as a novel class of photoswitchable serine hydrolase inhibitors and present a chemoproteomic platform for rapid discovery of optically controlled serine hydrolase targets in complex proteomes. Specifically, we identify highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes carboxylesterases 1 and 2 and demonstrate the pharmacological application of our compounds by optically controlling the metabolism of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil. Collectively, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study provides a first example of photopharmacological tools to optically control drug metabolism by modulating the activity of a metabolizing enzyme. Our arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones offer synthetically accessible scaffolds that can be expanded to a larger library with hundreds of compounds to identify specific photoswitchable inhibitors for other serine hydrolases, including lipases, peptidases, and proteases and our chemoproteomic platform can be expanded to other photoswitches and scaffolds to achieve optical control over diverse protein classes.</dc:description>

      <title>Potential&#8208;dependent Morphology of Copper Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction Revealed by In Situ Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The unresolved dynamic morphology of copper electrodes during the electrochemical CO  2  reduction (CO  2  RR) impedes deriving structure&#8208;reactivity relationships and controlling the catalytic properties of CO  2  RR electrocatalysts under operating conditions. We demonstrate that electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM) is a powerful tool for the real&#8208;space characterization of catalysts under realistic CO  2  RR conditions. Despite the challenges related to imaging within a highly gas&#8208;evolving potential regime (down to &#8211;1.1 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode), the evolution of structural features ranging from the micrometer to the atomic&#8208;scale could be resolved during CO  2  RR. Using Cu(100) as model surface, distinct nanoscale surface morphologies and their potential&#8208;dependent transformations from granular to smoothly curved mound&#8208;pit surfaces or structures with rectangular terraces are revealed during CO  2  RR in 0.1 M KHCO  3  . The density of undercoordinated copper sites during CO  2  RR is shown to increase with decreasing potential.  In situ  atomic scale imaging reveals specific adsorption occurring at distinct cathodic potentials impacting the observed catalyst structure. These results show the complex interrelation of the morphology, structure, defect density, applied potential and electrolyte in copper CO  2  RR catalysts, which are key for understanding and controlling the catalyst selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Light Controlled Cell&#8208;Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis</title>
      <dc:description>Cell&#8208;cycle interference by small molecules has widely been used to study fundamental biological mechanisms and to treat a great variety of diseases, most notably cancer. However, at present only limited possibilities exist for spatio&#8208;temporal control of the cell cycle.

The versatile proteasome inhibitor MG132 is photocaged directly at the reactive aldehyde function effectively masking its biological activity. Upon irradiation reversible cell cycle arrest in metaphase is demonstrated to take place&#160;in vivo. Similarly, apoptosis can efficiently be induced by irradiation of human cancer cells. With the developed photopharmacological approach spatio&#8208;temporal control of the cell cycle is thus enabled with very high modulation, as caged MG132 shows no effect on proliferation in the dark. In addition, full compatibility of photo&#8208;controlled uncaging with dynamic microcopy techniques&#160;in vivo&#160;is demonstrated.&#160;This visible&#8208;light responsive tool should be of great value for biological as well as medicinal approaches in need of high&#8208;precision targeting of the proteasome and thereby the cell cycle and apoptosis.</dc:description>

      <title>Does Molecular Catalyst Selectivity Change with Time? Polymerization Imaged via Single&#8208;Molecule Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The chemoselectivity of molecular catalysts underpins much of modern synthetic organic chemistry.&#160;&#160;Yet little is known about the selectivity of individual catalysts because this single&#8208;catalyst&#8208;level behavior is hidden by the bulk catalytic behavior.

      <title>MicroED Elucidation of Diverse Solid&#8208;State Packing in a Family of Electron&#8208;Deficient Expanded Helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state packing plays a defining role in the properties of a molecular organic material, but it is difficult to elucidate in the absence of single crystals that are suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction. Here, we demonstrate the coupling of divergent synthesis with microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for rapid assessment of solid&#8208;state packing motifs, using a class of chiral nanocarbons &#8211; expanded helicenes &#8211; as a proof of concept. Two highly selective oxidative dearomatizations of a readily&#8208;accessible helicene provided a divergent route to four electron&#8208;deficient analogues containing quinone or quinoxaline units. Crystallization efforts consistently yielded microcrystals that were unsuitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, but ideal for MicroED. This technique facilitated the elucidation of solid&#8208;state structures of all five compounds with &lt;1.1 &#197; resolution. The otherwise&#8208;inaccessible data revealed a range of notable packing behavior, including four different space groups, homochirality in a crystal for a helicene with an extremely low enantiomerization barrier, and nanometer scale cavities. The results of this study suggest that MicroED will soon become an indispensable tool for high&#8208;throughput investigations in pursuit of next&#8208;generation organic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergistic Interplay of Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Reactive Polymer Nanoassembly Facilitates Intracellular Delivery of Antibodies</title>
      <dc:description>Utility of antibody as a therapeutic is by far limited to extracellular or membrane bound proteins, even though these molecules can be engineered to recognize many &#8220;undruggable&#8221; therapeutic targets. The primary impediments in developing large antibodies as drugs against intracellular targets involve their low transfection efficiency and suitable reversible encapsulation strategies for intracellular delivery with retention of biological activity. To address this, we outline an electrostatics&#8208;enhanced covalent self&#8208;assembly strategy to generate polymer&#8208;protein/antibody nanoassemblies. Through structure&#8208;activity studies, we down&#8208;select the best performing self&#8208;immolative pentafluorophenyl containing activated carbonate polymer for bioconjugation. With the help of an electrostatics&#8208;aided covalent self&#8208;assembly approach, we demonstrate efficient encapsulation of medium to large proteins (HRP, 44 kDa and&#160;&#946;&#8208;gal, 465 kDa)&#160;and antibodies (~150 kDa). The designed polymeric nanoassemblies are shown to successfully traffic functional antibodies (anti&#8208;NPC and anti&#8208;pAkt) to cytosol to elicit their bioactivity towards binding intracellular protein epitopes and inducing apoptosis.</dc:description>

      <title>Electro&#8208;active pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence polymer based on a donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry</title>
      <dc:description>Amorphous polymers showing pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have emerged as an attractive alternative to crystalline small molecular phosphors due to their ease of film preparation and compatibility with flexible electronics. However, the current reported RTP polymers are electrically insulating, and unable to be used to fabricate practical optoelectronic devices that require charge transporting capability to some degree. Here we demonstrate an electro&#8208;active RTP polymer based on a characteristic donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry. Compared with the donor&#8208;acceptor reference, the inserted oxygen atom between donor and acceptor can not only decrease hole&#8208;electron orbital overlap to suppress the charge transfer fluorescence, but also strengthen spin&#8208;orbital coupling effect to facilitate the intersystem crossing and subsequent phosphorescence channels. As a result , a significant RTP is observed in solid states under photo excitation. Most noticeably, the corresponding polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) reveal a dominant electrophosphorescence with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 9.7%. The performance goes well beyond the 5% theoretical limit for typical fluors, opening a new door to the development of pure organic RTP polymers towards efficient PLEDs .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A novel synthetic strategy toward reversible cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials with tunable fluorescence properties is presented. Dimaleimide&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (TPE&#8208;2MI), which is non&#8208;emissive due to the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PET) between maleimide (MI) and tetraphenylethene (TPE) groups, was used to cross&#8208;link random copolymers of methyl (MM), decyl (DM) or lauryl (LM) with furfuryl methacrylate (FM). The mixture of copolymer and TPE&#8208;2MI in DMF showed reversible fluorescence with &#8220;on/off&#8221; behavior depending on the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA)/retro&#8208;DA process, which is easily adjusted by temperature. At high temperatures, the retro&#8208;DA reaction of polymer networks is dominant, and the fluorescence is quenched by the PET mechanism. In contrast, at low temperatures, the emission recovers as the DA reaction takes over. Based on these results, a transparent PMFM/TPE&#8208;2MI film was prepared, and the emission behavior was investigated. It was found that the polymer film shows an accurate response to the external temperature and exhibited tunable fluorescent &#8220;turn on/off&#8221; behavior. These exciting results suggest the possible application of this type of reversible cross&#8208;linked materials in many areas, including information security and transmission.

      <title>Enantioselective Protonation through Hydrophosphinylation of 1,1&#8208;Vinyl Azaheterocycle N&#8208;Oxides Catalyzed by Chiral Bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane as Higher Order Organosuperbase</title>
      <dc:description>An enantioselective protonation through a novel hydrophosphinylation reaction of diarylphosphine oxides with 2&#8208;vinyl azaheterocycle  N  &#8208;oxide derivatives was demonstrated using chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane as the higher order organosuperbase catalyst. It was confirmed on the basis of several control experiments that a chiral weak conjugate acid of the chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane, instead of achiral diarylphosphine oxides, directly functioned as the proton source to afford the corresponding product in a highly enantioselective manner in most cases. The present enantioselective protonation by a weak conjugate acid generated from the higher order organosuperbase would broaden the scope of enantioselective reaction systems because of the utilization of a range of less acidic pronucleophiles. This methodology is highlighted by the valuable synthesis of a series of chiral P,N&#8208;ligands for chiral metal complexes through the reduction of phosphine oxide and  N  &#8208;oxide units of the corresponding product without loss of enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

It was confirmed on the basis of several control experiments that a chiral weak conjugate acid of the chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane, instead of achiral diarylphosphine oxides, directly functioned as the proton source to afford the corresponding product in a highly enantioselective manner in most cases. The present enantioselective protonation by a weak conjugate acid generated from the higher order organosuperbase would broaden the scope of enantioselective reaction systems because of the utilization of a range of less acidic pronucleophiles. This methodology is highlighted by the valuable synthesis of a series of chiral P,N&#8208;ligands for chiral metal complexes through the reduction of phosphine oxide and  N  &#8208;oxide units of the corresponding product without loss of enantiomeric purity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free, highly regioselective, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H methylation of (hetero)arenes is reported. The reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility and is demonstrated to work for the late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H methylation of biologically active compounds. The method requires no external heating and benefits from considerably shorter reaction times than previous solution&#8208;based C&#8211;H methylation protocols.

      <title>In Vivo Uranium Antidotal Therapy by a Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Internal uranium contamination as a consequence of uranium mining, nuclear incident, and nuclear terrorist attacks is one of the most significant concerns in society today. The most effective strategies for dealing with this issue, if it arises, is to develop new materials that can rapidly capture and remove the uranium from the body. However, current selections of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art antidotal agents suffer from clear drawbacks dealing with limited uranium capture capability, poor selectivity, and/or high toxicity. Here, we propose a new agent for actinide antidotal therapy with fast uranium uptake kinetics and efficient in vivo uranium removal by a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic framework (nano&#8208;MOF). UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles post&#8208;synthetically functionalized with carboxyl groups, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)  4  &#8208;180, exhibit the fastest uranium uptake kinetics reported with more than 65% of uranyl in fetal bovine serum (FBS) removed within 5 min. Moreover, the in vivo bio&#8208;distribution studies show that the material accumulates in kidneys and femurs where uranium mainly deposits facilitating the in vivo removal of uranium. The results of the in vivo uranium removal assays with mice show that UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)  4  &#8208;180 could successfully reduce the amounts of uranyl deposited in kidneys and femurs by up to 55.4% and 36.5%, respectively, and is significantly more efficient than the commercial actinide decorporation agent, ZnNa  3  &#8208;DTPA.</dc:description>

      <title>Electric&#8208;Field Mediated Electron Tunneling of Supramolecular Naphthalimide Nanostructures for Biomimetic H2 Production</title>
      <dc:description>This work reported on the smart design and synthesis of two   novel semiconducting  bis  (4&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;bridging 1, 8&#8208;naphthalimide) bolaamphiphiles (BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  and BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  ) to fabricate supramolecular metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) nanostructures  for biomimetic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. An impressive H  2  evolution rate of  ca.  3.12 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  and an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of  ca.  1.63 % at 400 nm were achieved over the BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  &#8208;NH  3  +  &#8208;Ni MIS photosystem prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  with the opposite&#8208;charged  DuBois  &#8208;Ni catalysts.  The hot electrons of photoexcited BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  nanofibers were tunnelled to the molecular Ni collectors across a salt bridge and  an alkyl region of 2.2&#8208;2.5 nm length at a rate of 6.10&#215;10  8  s  &#8208;1  , which is five&#8208;times larger than the BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  nanoribbons (1.17&#215;10  8  s  &#8208;1  ). The transient spectral studies revealed that  the electric field benefited significantly the electron tunneling dynamics and  compensated the charge&#8208;separated states insufficient in the BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  nanofibers, consequently a comparable hydrogen evolution rate to the inverse BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  &#8208;COO  &#8208;  &#8208;Ni photosystem.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Bio&#8208;Barcode Assay Enables Electrochemical Detection of a Cancer Biomarker in Undiluted Human Plasma: A Sample&#8208;In&#8208;Answer&#8208;Out Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrochemical bio&#8208;barcode assay allows protein biomarkers to be analyzed in undiluted and unprocessed human plasma samples. The dynamic DNA/protein complexes, composed of antibody&#8208;labelled DNA motifs (TB and B*C) and redox&#8208;labelled DNA (CR*), eliminate the need for multistep processing and allow sample&#8208;in&#8208;answer&#8208;out analysis.







Abstract
There is a need for biosensing systems that can be operated at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) for disease screening and diagnostics and health monitoring. In spite of this, simple to operate systems with the required analytical sensitivity and specificity in clinical samples, using a sample&#8208;in&#8208;answer&#8208;out approach, remain elusive. Reported here is an electrochemical bio&#8208;barcode assay (e&#8208;biobarcode assay) that integrates biorecognition with signal transduction using molecular (DNA/protein) machines and signal readout using nanostructured electrodes. The e&#8208;biobarcode assay eliminates multistep processing and uses a single step for analysis following sample collection into the reagent tube. A clinically relevant performance for the analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in undiluted and unprocessed human plasma: a log&#8208;linear range of 1&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1&#8211;200&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and a LOD of 0.4&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1, was achieved. The e&#8208;biobarcode assay offers a realistic solution for biomarker analysis at the POC.

      <title>Unlocking Nature's Biosynthetic Power&#8212;Metabolic Engineering for the Fermentative Production of Chemicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances and future perspectives in microbial metabolic engineering are described in this Review, with a focus on selected commercially relevant examples. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products can now be easily discovered and optimized to enable competitive production processes. Moreover, nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways can now be rearranged to yield novel biosynthetic routes.







Abstract
Fermentation as a production method for chemicals is especially attractive, as it is based on cheap renewable raw materials and often exhibits advantages in terms of costs and sustainability. The tremendous development of technology in bioscience has resulted in an exponentially increasing knowledge about biological systems and has become the main driver for innovations in the field of metabolic engineering. Progress in recombinant DNA technology, genomics, and computational methods open new, cheaper, and faster ways to metabolically engineer microorganisms. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products, such as vitamins, organic acids, amino acids, or secondary metabolites, can be discovered and optimized efficiently, thereby enabling competitive commercial production processes. Novel biosynthetic routes can now be designed by the rearrangement of nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways in microbial strains. This expands the range of chemicals accessible by biotechnology and has yielded the first commercial products, while new fermentation technologies targeting novel active ingredients, commodity chemicals, and CO2&#8208;fixation methods are on the horizon.

      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed sp  2  carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#8211;N) formation is a reliable method with which to synthesize aryl amines. Catalytic sp  3  C&#8211;N formation reactions have been reported occasionally, and methods which can realize both sp  2  and sp  3  C&#8211;N formation are relatively unexplored. Here we address this challenge with a method of catalytic decarboxylative C&#8211;N formation which proceeds through a cascade carboxylic acid activation, acyl azide formation, Curtius rearrangement and nucleophilic addition reaction. The reaction uses naturally abundant organic carboxylic acids as carbon sources, readily prepared azidoformates as the nitrogen sources, and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and Cu(OAc)  2  as catalysts with as low as 0.1 mol% loading, providing protected alkyl, alkenyl and aryl amines in high yields with gaseous N  2  and CO  2  as the only byproducts. Examples are demonstrated of late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and drug molecules, stereospecific synthesis of useful &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl amines, and rapid construction of different ureas and primary amines.</dc:description>

      <title>Repurposing the 3&#8208;Isocyanobutanoic Acid Adenylation Enzyme SfaB for Versatile Amidation and Thioesterification</title>
      <dc:description>Genome mining of microbial natural products enables chemists not only to discover the bioactive molecules with novel skeletons, but also to identify the enzymes that catalyze diverse chemical reactions. Exploring the substrate promiscuity and catalytic mechanism of those biosynthetic enzymes facilitate the development of potential biocatalysts. SfaB is an acyl adenylate&#8208;forming enzyme that adenylates a unique building block, 3&#8208;isocyanobutanoic acid, in the biosynthetic pathway of the diisonitrile natural product SF2768 produced by  Streptomyces thioluteus  , and this AMP&#8208;ligase was demonstrated to accept a broad range of short&#8208;chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Herein, we repurpose SfaB to catalyze amidation and thioesterification between those SCFAs and various amine or thiol nucleophiles, thereby providing an alternative enzymatic approach to prepare the corresponding amides and thioesters in vitro.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactivity, Selectivity and Synthesis of 4&#8208;C&#8208;Silylated Glycosyl Donors and 4&#8208;Deoxy Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>A method for introducing dimethylphenylsilyl at the 4&#8209;position in carbohydrates has been developed. Two C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors were prepared via levoglucosenone, starting from cellulose. The glycosylation properties were studied using three glucoside acceptors, a 3&#8208;OH, 4&#8208;OH and 6&#8208;OH. Compared with the 4&#8209;deoxy variant, it was found that the anomeric selectivity was influenced more by the C&#8208;2 substituents orientation than the silyl in the 4&#8208;position. In general, the reactivity of these donors was higher than the corresponding 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;analogue, albeit a competition experiment showed that the introduction of a C&#8208;Si increases the relative reactivity by a modest factor of around two.</dc:description>

      <title>Series of Crystals with Giant Optical Anisotropy: A Targeted Strategic Research</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence, as a key optical characteristic in polaized light, takes a vital role in optical communication, polarizing microscopic observation, and laser phase&#8208;matching. Currently, the main commercially used birefringent oxides &#945;&#8208;BaB2O  4  and YVO4  have the birefringences of 0.12 and 0.22, respectively. With the development of optical technology, more strict requirements for enhancing birefringence of oxides have been emerging. In this work, we propose a targeted high&#8208;throughput screening system to search birefringence&#8208;active functional modules (FMs) and large birefringent materials. A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8208;  , [C2O6]2&#8208;  , [C4O4]2&#8208;  , and [C6O6]2&#8208;  units are discovered to be novel birefringence&#8208;active FMs. Increasing optical anisotropy appears in order of [CO3]2&#8208;  , [C2O4]2&#8208;  , [C2O6]2&#8208;  , [C4O4]2&#8208;  , and [C6O6]2&#8208;  according to quantum chemistry calculations. The theoretical and experimental studies on the oxycarbides confirm the feasibility of strategy. Based on this, the oxycarbides ranging from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared region with large birefringence from 0.1 to 1.35 are found, most of them break through the birefringent limit of oxides. And the largest one is 11 and 6 times of &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4  and YVO4  unprecedentedly. The (NH4)2C2O4  &#183;H2O crystal is grown and its experimental birefringence is 0.248 at 546 nm, which is identified as a promising UV birefringent crystal. In addition to newly found FMs, the A&#8208;site cations take significant roles in optical properties by influencing the density and arrangement of C&#8208;O units. The screened out compounds prove the validity of the FM&#8208;driven strategy, which would be a guide&#8208;line for exploring new birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

      <title>Radical Carbonyl Propargylation via Dual Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonyl propargylation has been established as a valuable tool in the realm of carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety has been recognized as an alternative pronucleophile in the above transformation through an ionic mechanism. Herein, we report for the first time the radical carbonyl propargylation  via  dual chromium/photoredox catalysis. A library of valuable homopropargylic alcohols bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers could be obtained through a catalytic radical three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes and suitable radical precursors (41 examples).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbonyl propargylation has been established as a valuable tool in the realm of carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety has been recognized as an alternative pronucleophile in the above transformation through an ionic mechanism. Herein, we report for the first time the radical carbonyl propargylation  via  dual chromium/photoredox catalysis. A library of valuable homopropargylic alcohols bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers could be obtained through a catalytic radical three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes and suitable radical precursors (41 examples). This redox&#8208;neutral multi&#8208;component reaction occurs under very mild conditions and shows high functional group tolerance. Remarkably, bench&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic and inexpensive CrCl  3  could be employed as a chromium source. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, which offers a complementary and novel approach towards the preparation of valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Imaging Sodium Dendrite Growth in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries using 23Na T2&#8208;weighted MRI</title>

      <title>Ligand&#8208;dependent activity engineering of glutathione peroxidase&#8208;mimicking MIL&#8208;47(V) metal&#8211;organic framework nanozyme for therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) plays an important role in maintaining the reactive oxygen metabolic balance, yet limited GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are currently available for  in vivo  therapy. Herein, a ligand engineering strategy is developed to modulate the GPx&#8208;mimicking activity of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanozyme. With different substituted ligands, the GPx&#8208;mimicking activities of MIL&#8208;47(V)&#8208;X (X = F, Br, NH  2  , CH  3  , OH, and H) MOFs are rationally regulated. With the best one as an example, both  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments reveal the excellent antioxidation ability of MIL&#8208;47(V)&#8208;NH  2  , which alleviates inflammatory response effectively for both ear injury and colitis, better than less&#8208;active MIL&#8208;47(V). This study proves that high&#8208;performance GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozymes can be rationally designed by a ligand engineering strategy, and that structure&#8208;activity relationships can direct the  in vivo  therapy. Therefore, it not only enriches the research of nanozymes, but also expands the range of the biomimetic MOFs and knowledge&#8208;enabled nanomedicine.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Origami Templated Growth of Multilamellar Lipid Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Lipids are important building blocks in cellular compartments and their supramolecular self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical structures has gained major interest. Cationic lipids and unstructured DNA can co&#8208;assemble into highly ordered structures (lipoplexes), but potential applications of lipoplexes are still rather limited. Using scaffolded DNA origami nanostructures could aid in resolving these drawbacks. Here, we have complexed DNA origami together with a cationic lipid 1,2&#8208;dioleoly&#8208;3&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;propane (DOTAP) and studied their self&#8208;assembly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The results suggest that the DNA origami function as a template for the growth of multilamellar lipid structures and that the DNA origami are embedded in the formed lipid matrix. Furthermore, the lipid encapsulation was found to significantly shield the DNA origami against nuclease digestion.

      <title>Coherent Vibration and Femtosecond Dynamics of the Platinum Complex Oligomers upon Intermolecular Bond Formation in the Excited State</title>
      <dc:description>Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption and picosecond time&#8208;resolved emission measurements were carried out for highly concentrated aqueous solutions of K  2  [Pt(CN)  4  ] to investigate excited&#8208;state dynamics of the [Pt(CN)  4  2&#8210;  ] oligomers formed with metallophilic interaction.

Advanced electron microscopy tools show they are composed of amorphous silica and iron nanoparticles of large surface areas and inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;particle porosity. Their building resembles that of a heterogeneous catalyst, but they can also exhibit a bilayer structure. Additional surface area measurements suggest that membranes grown from natural waters hold even higher catalytic potential.

      <title>A radical approach to make unnatural amino acids through converting C&#8211;S bonds in cysteine derivatives to C&#8211;C bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report a general approach to make unnatural amino acids from readily available cysteine derivatives. This method capitalizes on an intramolecular radical substitution process that generates alkyl radicals through C&#8211;S cleavage. The resulting alkyl radicals partook in diverse C&#8211;C bond forming events. These reactions proceed under mild, photocatalytic conditions at room temperature, and can be performed open to air. The utility of these transformations is further demonstrated in the straightforward synthesis of various unnatural amino acids and peptides that are difficult to access previously.</dc:description>

This method capitalizes on an intramolecular radical substitution process that generates alkyl radicals through C&#8211;S cleavage. The resulting alkyl radicals partook in diverse C&#8211;C bond forming events. These reactions proceed under mild, photocatalytic conditions at room temperature, and can be performed open to air. The utility of these transformations is further demonstrated in the straightforward synthesis of various unnatural amino acids and peptides that are difficult to access previously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Capacitor&#8208;type Faradaic Junction for Direct Solar Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;electrode solar rechargeable devices trigger intense attention due to their potential applications in solar energy conversion and storage. However, interface energy barriers lead to severe loss of output voltage and negligible dark discharge current. Therefore, external biases are required for dark discharge in these devices, limiting their practical applications.   Herein, we report a new two&#8208;electrode device of Si/WO3  /H2SO4(aq)  /C that can work without bias.   To the best of our knowledge, the device indicates the highest dark output power among all of the two&#8208;electrode solar rechargeable devices.  The device based on a Si/WO3  junction indicates photo&#8208;induced adjustable interface barrier height during charge transfer, which can overcome the energy barrier and realize dark discharge without bias. Due to the novel interface characteristic, the Si/WO3  is designated as a capacitor&#8208;type Faradaic junction for the first time. The concept of a capacitor&#8208;type Faradaic junction paves an avenue to construct other new devices in solar cells,  artificial synapses  ,  smart&#160;windows  and so on.</dc:description>

      <title>Spin&#8208;controlled binding of carbon dioxide by an iron center. Insights from ultrafast mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The influence of the spin on the mode of binding between carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) and a transition metal (TM) center is an entirely open question.

      <title>Insights into the composition and structural chemistry of gallium(I) triflate</title>
      <dc:description>&#8220;GaOTf&#8221; is a simple, convenient source of low&#8208;valent gallium for synthetic chemistry and catalysis. However, little is currently known about its composition or reactivity. In this work,  71  Ga NMR shows the presence of [Ga(arene)  n  ]  +  salts on oxidation of Ga metal with AgOTf in arene solvents. However, a more complex picture of speciation is uncovered by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GaOTf&#8221; is a simple, convenient source of low&#8208;valent gallium for synthetic chemistry and catalysis. However, little is currently known about its composition or reactivity. In this work,  71  Ga NMR shows the presence of [Ga(arene)  n  ]  +  salts on oxidation of Ga metal with AgOTf in arene solvents. However, a more complex picture of speciation is uncovered by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. In all cases, mixed&#8208;valence compounds containing Ga&#8208;arene and Ga&#8208;OTf coordination motifs, in addition to an unusual &#8220;naked&#8221; [Ga]  +  ion, are found.

      <title>Preparation of Complexes Bearing N&#8208;Alkylated, Anionic or Protic CAACs Through Oxidative Addition of 2&#8208;Halogenoindole Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>CAAC precursors 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindole  1  and 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindolium tetrafluoroborate  2BF4  have been prepared and oxidatively added to [M(PPh3)4  ] (M = Pd, Pt). Salt  2BF4  reacts with [Pd(PPh3)4  ] in toluene at 25 &#176;C over 4 d to yield complex cis&#8208;[3]BF4  featuring an N&#8208;ethyl substituted CAAC, two cis&#8208;arranged phosphines and a chloro ligand. Compound trans&#8208;[3]BF4  was obtained from the same reaction at 80 &#176;C over 1 d. Salt  2BF4  reacts with [Pt(PPh3)4  ] to give cis&#8208;[4]BF4. The neutral indole derivative  1  adds oxidatively to [Pt(PPh3)4  ] to give trans&#8208;[5] featuring a CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom has been protonated with py&#8901;HBF4  to give trans&#8208;[6]BF4  bearing a protic CAAC ligand. The PdII  complex trans&#8208;[7]BF4  bearing a protic CAAC ligand was obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction from  1  and [Pd(PPh3)4  ] in the presence of py&#8901;HBF4  .</dc:description>

      <title>Structure based design of bicyclic peptide inhibitors of RbAp48</title>
      <dc:description>The scaffolding protein RbAp48 is part of several epigenetic regulation complexes and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. In order to develop tool compounds for the study of RbAp48 function, we have developed peptide inhibitors targeting the protein&#8208;protein interaction interface between RbAp48 and the scaffold protein MTA1. Based on a MTA1&#8208;derived linear peptide with low micromolar affinity and informed by crystallographic analysis, a bicyclic peptide was developed that inhibits the RbAp48/MTA1 interaction with a very low nanomolar KD value of 8.56 nM, and which showed appreciable stability against cellular proteases. Design included exchange of a polar amide cyclization strategy to hydrophobic aromatic linkers enabling mono&#8208; and bicyclization by means of cysteine alkylation, which improved affinity by direct interaction of the linkers with a hydrophobic residue on RbAp48. Our results demonstrate that stepwise evolution of a structure&#8208;based design is a suitable strategy for inhibitor development targeting PPIs.</dc:description>
