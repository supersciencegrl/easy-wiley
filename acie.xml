         <title>Semi&#8208;Metallic Superionic Layers Suppressing Voltage Fading of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Towards Superior&#8208;Stable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs) with greater specific capacity density are constrained by voltage attenuation and inferior rate performance because of irreversible oxygen release, metal dissolving and poor lithium&#8208;ion transport capacity. Herein, a simple surface modification is designed to solve the performance degradation and structural collapse of LRLOs. Combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO) with spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, is introduced to the surface of the cathode restrains the activated surficial lattice oxygen ions by its stable oxygen vacancies. Additionally, Ni doping results in a fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 structure (LNO) with lowered lithium ions diffusion barrier, which is tightly conjugating to substrate and synergistically reinforces the Li diffusion path through the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Moreover, Mn dissolution is successfully relieved due to the decrease in Mn concentration in the coating layers. As a result, the modified material (LRLO@LMO@LNO) exhibits an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 120.4 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 10 C with a very small discharge voltage attenuation of 313 mV after 600 cycles (0.52 mV per cycle) at 1 C. Undoubtedly, this method discloses a simple and effective approach to promote the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density.</dc:description>

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid&#8208;induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8208;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;&#8208;alkoxynitriles, &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrazones become easily available. These exhibit synthetically valuable substitution patterns for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, intermediates for total synthesis and amino acid synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on the Development of Pouch&#8208;Type Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; in the energy storage field due to their high energy density (theoretically &gt;500 Wh kg&#8208;1). Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to promote the research &amp; development (R&amp;D) of pouch&#8208;type LMBs toward practical application. This article aims to provide a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth review of recent progress on pouch&#8208;type LMBs from full cell aspect, and to offer insights to guide its future development. It will review pouch&#8208;type LMBs using both liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and cover topics related to both Li and cathode (including LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2, S and O2) as both electrodes impact the battery performance. The key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs and their relationship in between are introduced first, then the major challenges facing the development of pouch&#8208;type LMBs are discussed in detail, especially those severely aggravated in pouch cells compared with coin cells. Subsequently, the recent progress on mechanistic understandings of the degradation of pouch&#8208;type LMBs is summarized, followed with the practical strategies that have been utilized to address these issues and to improve the key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs. In the end, it provides perspectives on advancing the R&amp;Ds of pouch&#8208;type LMBs towards their application in practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Titanium and Chromium Catalysis in a Reaction Network for the Reprogramming of [BH4]&#8208; as Electron Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reagent for Radical Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We describe a unique catalytic system with an efficient coupling of Ti&#8208; and Cr&#8208;catalyst in a reaction network that allows the use of [BH4]&#8208; as stoichiometric hydrogen atom and electron donor in catalytic radical chemistry. The key feature is a relay hydrogen atom transfer from [BH4]&#8208; to Cr generating the active catalysts under mild conditions. This enables epoxide reductions, regiodivergent epoxide opening and radical cyclizations that are not possible with cooperative catalysis with radicals or by epoxide reductions via Meinwald rearrangement and ensuing carbonyl reduction. No typical SN2&#8208;type reactivity of [BH4]&#8208; salts is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective activation of strong C&#8211;Cl bond for highly selective photosynthesis of bibenzyl via homo&#8208;coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;carbon&#160;coupling of organic halides as an important process in organic synthesis has been successfully achieved in homogeneous catalysis, while the dependence on rare noble metals, complicated metal&#8208;complex and poor catalyst stability and recyclability, need&#160;to be tackled. The past few years have witnessed heterogeneous photocatalysis as&#160;green and novel methods for organic synthesis processes. However, the study on C&#8211;C coupling of chloride substrates is very limited due to the extremely high bond energy of C&#8211;Cl bond (327 kJ mol&#8208;1). Here, we report a robust heterogeneous photocatalyst (Cu/ZnO) to drive the homo&#8208;coupling of benzyl chloride with high efficiency, which achieves an unprecedented high selectivity of bibenzyl (93%) and yield rate of 92% at room temperature. Moreover, this photocatalytic process can be applied to 10 benzyl chlorides with high yields. With detailed characterisation (XPS, EPR, TPD) and DFT calculation, the high selectivity is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of reactants, stabilisation of intermediates (benzyl radicals) for the selective coupling by the Cu loading and the moderate oxidation ability of ZnO support, besides the promoted charge separation and transfer by Cu species. Therefore, this work offers a new route to highly selective synthesise bibenzyl from chloride substrates by a stable heterogeneous system.</dc:description>

         <title>NH4+ Charge Carrier Coordinated H&#8208;Bonded Organic Small Molecule for Fast and Superstable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small molecules as high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Zn&#8722;organic batteries have inspired numerous interests, but are trapped by their easy&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes. Here we knit ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (DNPT) and NH4+ charge carrier. DNPT with octuple&#8208;active carbonyl/nitro centers (H&#8208;bond acceptor) are redox&#8208;exclusively accessible for flexible tetrahedral NH4+ ions (H&#8208;bond donator) but exclude larger and rigid Zn2+, due to a lower activation energy (0.14 vs. 0.31 eV). NH4+ coordinated H&#8208;bonding chemistry conquers the stability barrier of DNPT in electrolyte, and gives fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A stable two&#8208;step 4e&#8722; NH4+ coordination with DNPT cathode harvests a high capacity (320 mAh g&#8722;1), a high&#8208;rate capability (50 A g&#8722;1) and an ultralong life (60,000 cycles). This finding points to a new paradigm for H&#8208;bond stabilized organic small molecules to design advanced zinc batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry Reveals Kinetics Information of Metal&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Multiple Redox Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB) has emerged as a promising cathode material in aqueous batteries. It possesses two distinct redox centers, and the potassium ions (K+) are unevenly distributed throughout the compound, adding complexity to the interpretation of the K+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion kinetic mechanism. Traditional ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements are limited in uncovering the precise kinetic information of the PB particles, as the results are influenced by the construction of the porous composite electrode and the redox behavior from different particles. In this study, the electrochemical processes of individual PB particles were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. By varying the potentials, different types of transient current signals were obtained that revealed the kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction in combination with theoretical simulation. Additionally, a partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was discussed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the electrochemical processes of cathode materials with multiple redox centers, which facilitates the development of effective strategies to optimize these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Cation Solvation Structure for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balancing the activation of H2O is crucial for highly selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), as the protonation steps of CO2RR require fast H2O dissociation kinetics, while suppressing hydrogen evolution (HER) demands slow H2O reduction. We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H2O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K+ and accumulates in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H2O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H2O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H2O was stabilized via second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O&#8208;H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier from 0.93 to 0.42 eV. In the model electrolyte containing 5 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl&#8208;DMSO&#8208;5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2%, with FECO higher than 90.0% within &#8208;0.75 to &#8208;1.15 V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecule like N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Tribochemically Controlled Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Enabled by Contact Electrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional mechanochemically controlled reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) utilizes ultrasound or ball milling to regenerate activators, which induce the side reactions because of the high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency stimuli. Here, we proposed a facile approach for tribochemically controlled ATRP (tribo&#8208;ATRP), relying on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis between titanium oxide (TiO2) particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethylamine (TPMA), without any high&#8208;energy input. Under the friction induced by stirring, the titanium oxide particles were electrified, continuously reducing CuBr2/TPMA into CuBr/TPMA, thereby conversing alkyl halides into active radicals to start ATRP. In addition, the effect of friction on the reaction was elucidated by the theoretical simulation. The results indicated that elevated frequency could reduce the energy barrier for the electron transfer from titanium oxide (TiO2) particles to CuBr2/TPMA. In this study, the design of tribo&#8208;ATRP was successfully achieved, enabling a contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;catalysis (~ 10 Hz) access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Carbanionic Synthesis of Fully Bio&#8208;Based Triblock Structures Derived from &#946;&#8208;Farnesene and ll&#8208;Dilactide: Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current environmental challenges and the shrinking fossil&#8208;fuel feedstock are important criteria for the next generation of polymer materials. In this context, we present a fully bio&#8208;based material, which shows promise as thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Due to the use of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and L&#8208;lactide as monomers, bio&#8208;based feedstocks, namely sugar cane and corn can be used. A bifunctional initiator for the carbanionic polymerization was employed, to permit an efficient synthesis of ABA&#8208;type block structures. In addition, the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent MTBE (methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether) was used. This afforded low dispersity (&#272; = 1.07 to 1.10) and telechelic polyfarnesene macro&#173;initiators. These were employed for lactide polymerization to obtain H&#8208;shaped triblock copolymers. TEM and SAXS revealed clearly phase&#8208;separated morphologies and tensile tests revealed elastic mechanical properties. The materials featured two glass transition temperatures, at &#8208; 66 &#176;C and 51 &#176;C as well as gyroid or cylindrical morphologies, resulting in soft elastic materials at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By employing a chiral bifunctional phosphine ligand, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed efficient and highly enantioselective dearomatization of phenols is achieved via versatile metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. The reaction is proven to be remarkably general in scope, permitting substitutions at all four remaining benzene positions, accommodating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups including strongly deactivating nitro, and allowing carbon&#8208;based groups of varying steric bulk including t&#8208;butyl at the alkyne terminus. Moreover, besides N&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)alkynylamides, the corresponding ynoates and ynones are all suitable substrates. Spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones, spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;butenolides, and spirocyclohexadenone&#8208;cyclopentenones are formed in yields up to 99% and with ee up to 99%.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The control of the reactivity of diazo compounds is commonly achieved by the choice of a suitable catalyst, e.g. via stabilization of singlet carbenes or radical intermediates. Herein, we report on the light&#8208;promoted reactivity of cyclic diazo imides with thiols, where the choice of solvent results in two fundamentally different reaction pathways. In dichloromethane (DCM), a carbene is formed initially and engages in a cascade C&#8208;H functionalization/thiolation reaction to deliver indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidines in good to excellent yields. When switching to acetonitrile solvent, the carbene pathway is shut down and an unusual reduction of the diazo compound occurs under otherwise identical reaction conditions, where the aryl thiol acts as reductant. A combined set of experimental and computational studies was carried out to obtain mechanistic understanding and to support that indane formation proceeds via the insertion of a triplet carbene, while the reduction of diazo imides proceeds via an electron transfer process.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked [2]Rotaxane Aerogels with Tunable Morphologies and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical bonds have been utilized as promising motifs to construct mechanically interlocked aerogels (MIAs) with mechanical adaptivity and multifunctionality. However, fabricating such aerogels with not only precise chemical structures but also dynamic features remains challenging. Herein, we present MIAs carrying dense [2]rotaxane units, thereby enabling both the stability and flexibility of the aerogel network. Owing to the stable chemical structure of [2]rotaxane, MIAs possessing precise and full&#8208;scale mechanically interlocked network could be fabricated with the aid of diverse solvents. In addition, the dynamic nature of [2]rotaxane resulted in morphologies and mechanical performances of MIAs that can be dramatically modulated under chemical stimuli. We hope that the structure&#8208;property relationship in MIAs will facilitate the development of mechanically interlocked materials and provide novel opportunities toward constructing smart materials with multifunctionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Endocyclic 1&#8208;Azaallyl Anions: Concise Synthesis of Unprotected Enantioenriched cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diarylpiperidines</title>

         <dc:description>
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized from readily available piperidines in only three operations. The key step is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and endocyclic 1&#8208;azallyl anions, elusive intermediates derived from the in situ deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction can be achieved enantioselectively with a chiral mono&#8208;phosphine ligand.







Abstract
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized through an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions. These intermediates are generated in situ by the deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines, precursors that are readily prepared in two operations from simple piperidines. An asymmetric version of this reaction with (2R, 3R)&#8208;iPr&#8208;BI&#8208;DIME as the ligand provides products in moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Platinum Hybrids for Covalent Binding of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Structural Basis and Application to Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of G4&#8208;targeting organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, designed to covalently bind to the G4 binding site, could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway, induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and stimulate potent immunotherapy in vivo. This study highlights the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent binding in G4&#8208;targeting drug design.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been revived as promising therapeutic targets with the development of immunotherapy, but the G4&#8208;mediated immune response remains unclear. We designed a novel class of G4&#8208;binding organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, with spatial matching for G4 binding and G4 DNA reactivity for binding site locking. The solution structure of L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;MYT1L G4 demonstrated the effectiveness of the covalent binding and revealed the covalent binding&#8208;guided dynamic balance, accompanied by the destruction of the A5&#8208;T17 base pairs to achieve the covalent binding of the platinum unit to N7 of the G6 residue. Furthermore, L1&#8208;cispt&#8208; and L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;mediated genomic dysfunction could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). The use of L1&#8208;cispt/L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;treated dying cells as therapeutic vaccines stimulated a robust immune response and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent locking in G4&#8208;trageting drug design and their potential in immunotherapy.

         <title>Unidirectional Sidechain Engineering to Construct Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Acceptors for 19.23&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss and Efficient Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptor is developed using unidirectional sidechain engineering. Thanks to the low energy loss and efficient charge transfer properties, the corresponding organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values among annealing&#8208;free devices.







Abstract
Achieving both high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) to boost power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) is a major challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs), wherein high energy loss (Eloss) and inefficient charge transfer usually take place. Here, three new Y&#8208;series acceptors of mono&#8208;asymmetric asy&#8208;YC11 and dual&#8208;asymmetric bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC9 and bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 are developed. They share the same asymmetric D1AD2 (D1=thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and D2=selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) fused&#8208;core but have different unidirectional sidechain on D1 side, allowing fine&#8208;tuned molecular properties, such as intermolecular interaction, packing pattern, and crystallinity. Among the binary blends, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 one has better morphology with appropriate phase separation and higher order packing than the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;asy&#8208;YC9 and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC11 ones. Therefore, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs offer a higher PCE of 17.16&#8201;% with both high Voc and Jsc, due to the reduced Eloss and efficient charge transfer properties. Inspired by the high Voc and strong NIR&#8208;absorption, bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 is introduced into efficient binary PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO to construct ternary OSCs. Thanks to the broadened absorption, optimized morphology, and furtherly minimized Eloss, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among these annealing&#8208;free devices. Our developed unidirectional sidechain engineering for constructing bi&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptors provides an approach to boost PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects

Analytical treatment allows determining all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen mediated by DuBois/Shaw nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant bases. This analysis shed light on the key activity descriptors responsible for reversible vs. bidirectional catalysis and paves the way towards rational optimization of such molecular catalysts







Abstract
Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials up to 250&#8197;mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.

         <title>Atomically Precise Copper Nanoclusters for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 towards Hydrocarbons via Breaking the Coordination Symmetry of Cu Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu site in atomically precise Cu6 cluster to form Cu&#8208;S2N1 site, which rank the dx2&#8208;y2 orbital as the highest occupied d orbital to favor the specific coordination between C atom of CO2 and Cu&#8722;S2N1 site. This binding mode is conductive to the generation of *COOH instead of *OCHO, thereby switching the product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons.







Abstract
We propose an effective highest occupied d&#8208;orbital modulation strategy engendered by breaking the coordination symmetry of sites in the atomically precise Cu nanocluster (NC) to switch the product of CO2 electroreduction from HCOOH/CO to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons. An atomically well&#8208;defined Cu6 NC with symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 active sites (named Cu6(MBD)6, MBD=2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole) was designed and synthesized by a judicious choice of ligand containing both S and N coordination atoms. Different from the previously reported high HCOOH selectivity of Cu NCs with Cu&#8722;S3 sites, the Cu6(MBD)6 with Cu&#8722;S2N1 coordination structure shows a high Faradaic efficiency toward hydrocarbons of 65.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (including 42.5&#8201;% CH4 and 23&#8201;% C2H4), with the hydrocarbons partial current density of &#8722;183.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 sites can rearrange the Cu 3d orbitals with 
 as the highest occupied d&#8208;orbital, thus favoring the generation of key intermediate *COOH instead of *OCHO to favor *CO formation, followed by hydrogenation and/or C&#8722;C coupling to produce hydrocarbons. This is the first attempt to regulate the coordination mode of Cu atom in Cu NCs for hydrocarbons generation, and provides new inspiration for designing atomically precise NCs for efficient CO2RR towards highly&#8208;valued products.

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation with Polyhydride Ni/Ga Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic cluster [Ni3(GaTMP)7] reversibly forms di&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and hexahydride species under hydrogen pressure in solution, that were characterized by low temperature COSY and ROESY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. The work conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal main&#8208;group bimetallic clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.







Abstract
The bimetallic, decanuclear Ni3Ga7&#8208;cluster of the formula [Ni3(GaTMP)3(&#956;2&#8208;GaTMP)3(&#956;3&#8208;GaTMP)] (1, TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl) reacts reversibly with dihydrogen under the formation of a series of (poly&#8208;)hydride clusters 2. Low&#8208;temperature 2D NMR experiments at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C show that 2 consist of a mixture of a di&#8208; (2Di), tetra&#8208; (2Tetra) and hexahydride species (2Hexa). The structures of 2Di and 2Tetra are assessed by a combination of 2D NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The cooperation of both metals is essential for the high hydrogen uptake of the cluster. Polyhydrides 2 are catalytically active in the semihydrogenation of 4&#8208;octyne to 4&#8208;octene with good selectivity. The example is the first of its kind and conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal/main group metal clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial MVs induced silent secondary metabolite production in a wide range of bacteria by imitating interbacterial interactions. X.&#8197;innexi activated the production of xeinamides, xeidopeptides and xenoamicins through quorum sensing suppression by B.&#8197;multivorans MVs treatment. Xenoamicins carried in X.&#8197;innexi MVs suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, indicating interbacterial hostile interaction by MVs and secondary metabolites.







Abstract
Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B.&#8197;multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X.&#8197;innexi. In turn, the X.&#8197;innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B.&#8197;multivorans and X.&#8197;innexi through MV exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Bacterial MVs induced silent secondary metabolite production in a wide range of bacteria by imitating interbacterial interactions. &lt;i&gt;X.&#8197;innexi&lt;/i&gt; activated the production of xeinamides, xeidopeptides and xenoamicins through quorum sensing suppression by &lt;i&gt;B.&#8197;multivorans&lt;/i&gt; MVs treatment. Xenoamicins carried in &lt;i&gt;X.&#8197;innexi&lt;/i&gt; MVs suppressed the growth of &lt;i&gt;B.&#8197;multivorans&lt;/i&gt;, indicating interbacterial hostile interaction by MVs and secondary metabolites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell-to-cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia multivorans&lt;/i&gt; MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. A mechanistic analysis of MV-induced metabolite production in &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus innexi&lt;/i&gt; suggested that the &lt;i&gt;B.&#8197;multivorans&lt;/i&gt; MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in &lt;i&gt;X.&#8197;innexi&lt;/i&gt;. In turn, the &lt;i&gt;X.&#8197;innexi&lt;/i&gt; MVs carrying some MV-induced peptides suppressed the growth of &lt;i&gt;B.&#8197;multivorans&lt;/i&gt;, highlighting the interspecies communication between &lt;i&gt;B.&#8197;multivorans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;X.&#8197;innexi&lt;/i&gt; through MV exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment of Azoles&#8208;Related Covalent Organic Frameworks Precisely Regulates Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable covalent organic framework (COF) platform with three azole&#8208;related linkages was prepared through linker exchange reactions. The linkage microenvironment changes the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic performance. The thiazole linkage was more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages.







Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts is promising for wastewater treatment. The effect of linkage chemistry of COFs as functional basis to photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalysis remains a significant challenge. In this study, three kinds of azoles&#8208;linked COFs including thiazole&#8208;linked TZ&#8208;COF, oxazole&#8208;linked OZ&#8208;COF and imidazole&#8208;linked IZ&#8208;COF were successfully synthesized. More accessible channels of charge transfer were constructed in TZ&#8208;COF via the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure between thiazole linkage and pyrene linker, leading to efficient suppression of photoexcited charge recombination. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental studies, demonstrating that the thiazole linkage is more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages. The real active sites in COFs located at the benzene ring fragment between pyrene unit and azole linkage.

         <title>Nonclassical Crystallization Causes Dendritic and Band&#8208;Like Microscale Patterns in Inorganic Precipitates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic experiments yield compositionally pure Ni(OH)2 membranes that show internal microscale structures such as parallel bands, dendritic trees, and disorganized spots. These light&#8208;scattering patterns result from nonclassical crystallization and nanoparticle aggregation. The particles form in the flowing NiCl2 solution and self&#8208;organize aggregation zones&#8212;that for band patterns&#8212;move over the membrane surface in the upstream direction.







Abstract
The self&#8208;organization of complex solids can create patterns extending hierarchically from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. A frequently studied model is the chemical garden system which consists of life&#8208;like precipitate shapes. In this study, we examine the thin walls of chemical gardens using microfluidic devices that yield linear Ni(OH)2 precipitate membranes. We observe distinct light&#8208;scattering patterns within the compositionally pure membranes, including disorganized spots, dendrites, and parallel bands. The bands are tilted with respect to the membrane axis and their spacing (20&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;m) increases with increasing flow rates. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the bands consist of submicron particles embedded in a denser material and these particles are also found in the reactant stream. We propose that dendrites and bands arise from the attachment of solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles. The bands are generated by particle&#8208;aggregation zones moving upstream along the slowly advancing membrane surface. The speed of the aggregation zones is proportional to the band distance and defines the system's dispersion relation. This speed&#8208;wavelength dependence and the flow&#8208;opposing motion of the aggregation zones are likely caused by low particle concentrations in the wake of the zones that only slowly recover due to Brownian motion and particle nucleation.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Organoboron Species as Lewis Superacids and Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a T&#8208;shaped organoboron system with three stable oxidation states, which allowed for the isolation of geometrically constrained superacidic boron dication, ambiphilic boron radical cation and superbasic borylene.







Abstract
This report unveils an advancement in the formation of a Lewis superacid (LSA) and an organic superbase by the geometrical deformation of an organoboron species towards a T&#8208;shaped geometry. The boron dication [2]2+ supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA&gt;SbF5) and hydride ion affinity (HIA&gt;B(C6F5)3), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [2]2+ are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et3SiH and AgSbF6 respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two&#8208;electron reduction of [2]2+ affords stable boron radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and borylene 2, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798e at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. pKBH+ (MeCN)=47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.

         <title>A Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework with Oxidative and Reductive Sites for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline network is constructed by incorporating rhenium complexes and triazine ring structures as catalytic sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bonding. Appreciable charge&#8208;separation and transfer efficiency drive both the photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions in the conversion of CO2 to CO with H2O, and without any additional sacrificial agents or photosensitizers.







Abstract
Constructing a powerful photocatalytic system that can achieve the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction half&#8208;reaction and the water (H2O) oxidation half&#8208;reaction simultaneously is a very challenging but meaningful task. Herein, a porous material with a crystalline topological network, named viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re, was rationally synthesized by incorporating rhenium complexes as reductive sites and triazine ring structures as oxidative sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bond linkages. The charge&#8208;separation ability of viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re is promoted by low polarized &#960;&#8208;bridges between rhenium complexes and triazine ring units, and the efficient charge&#8208;separation enables the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, followed by an intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer process, to form photogenerated electrons involved in CO2 reduction and photogenerated holes that participate in H2O oxidation simultaneously. The viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re shows the highest catalytic photocatalytic carbon monoxide (CO) production rate (190.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with about 100&#8201;% selectivity) and oxygen (O2) evolution (90.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among all the porous catalysts in CO2 reduction with H2O as sacrificial agents. Therefore, a powerful photocatalytic system was successfully achieved, and this catalytic system exhibited excellent stability in the catalysis process for 50&#8197;hours. The structure&#8211;function relationship was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Controlled Partial Linker Thermolysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to Give a Single&#8208;Site Copper Photocatalyst for the Functionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis allows the microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to expand its porosity with a tailored pore environment. The resulting material accommodates single&#8208;site Cu species, shows significant mesoporosity and enhanced charge photogeneration. It has excellent performance in photocatalytic reactions for the functionalization of terminal alkynes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with expanding porosity and tailored pore environments are intriguing for catalytic applications. We report herein a straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis to introduce desirable mesopores into mono&#8208;ligand MOFs, which is different from the classical thermolyzing method that starts from mixed&#8208;linker MOFs. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, after partial ligand thermolysis, exhibits significant mesoporosity, retained crystal structure, improved charge photogeneration and abundant anchoring sites, which is ideal to explore single&#8208;site photocatalysis. Atomically dispersed Cu is then accommodated in the tailored pore. The resulting single&#8208;site Cu catalyst exhibits excellent performance for photocatalytic alkylation and oxidation coupling for the functionalization of terminal alkynes. The study highlights the advantage of controlled partial linker thermolysis to synthesize hierarchical MOFs to achieve the advanced single&#8208;site photocatalysis.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalent organic cages with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized metallacages. These covalent cages performed well as energy donors for the construction of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems for the photocatalytic dehalogenation reaction.







Abstract
A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and relatively high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction. This research provides a new avenue for the development of luminescent covalent cages for light&#8208;harvesting and photocatalysis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs) were prepared with different donor building units. Their photophysical studies indicated that the Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs with higher charge&#8208;carrier density and longer conjugation length led to a more efficient charge separation with a reduced exciton binding energy, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction into CO.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated di&#8208;carbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of DFT calculations and experiments were used to discover a large class of exfoliable h&#8208;MAB phases and their derivative h&#8208;MBenes. A representative 2D h&#8208;MBene, HfBO, was successfully synthesized by selectively etching the In layers from Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO was demonstrated to show lithium&#8208;ion storage performance for the first time.







Abstract
The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.

         <title>Gallium Triggers Ferroptosis through a Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga&#8208;1 anchors to mitochondria by binding to the membrane phospholipids and results in the dysfunction of the electron transfer chain as well as iron release, eventually triggering ferroptosis. In addition, Ga&#8208;1 inhibits protein disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum, breaking the antioxidant glutathione system. Both actions synergistically induce ferroptosis. In addition, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid enhances ferroptosis.







Abstract
The gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.

In addition, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid enhances ferroptosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gallium ion (Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non-apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (&lt;b&gt;Ga-1&lt;/b&gt;); we found that &lt;b&gt;Ga-1&lt;/b&gt; acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, &lt;b&gt;Ga-1&lt;/b&gt; also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of &lt;b&gt;Ga-1&lt;/b&gt; and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti-neoplastic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleophilic Attack at Pentaarsaferrocene [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)]&#8208;The Way to Larger Polyarsenide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective way for the nucleophilic substitution of the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) was found, resulting in first As5R entities. By the reduction of I, an access to the dianionic compound [(Cp*Fe)2{&#956;&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;As10}]2&#8722; (4), and by using As&#8208;based nucleophiles, the straightforward formation of tetramers representing the largest polyarsenide&#8208;containing (As20) molecular complexes could be achieved.







Abstract
By the reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) with main group nucleophiles, unique functionalized products with &#951;4&#8208;coordinated polyarsenide (Asn) units (n=5, 6, 20) are obtained. With carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles such as MeLi or KBn (Bn=CH2Ph), the anionic organo&#8208;substituted polyarsenide complexes, [Li(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5Me)] (1&#8201;a) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe{&#951;4&#8208;As5(CH2Ph)}] (1&#8201;b), are accessible. The use of KAsPh2 leads to a selective and controlled extension of the As5 unit and the formation of the monoanionic compound [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6Ph2)] (2). When I is reacted with [M]As(SiMe3)2 (M=Li&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF; K), the formation of the largest known anionic polyarsenide unit in [M&#8242;(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(Cp*Fe)4{&#956;5&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4:&#951;3:&#951;3:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;As20}] (3) occurred (M&#8242;=Li (3&#8201;a), K (3&#8201;b)).

         <title>Fast Polysulfide Conversion Catalysis and Reversible Anode Operation by A Single Cathode Modifier in Li&#8208;Metal Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalities were enabled by a single cathode modifier: i)&#8197;for the cathode, it can work as an effective catalyst to promote cathode reaction kinetics; ii)&#8197;for the anode, trace amounts of dissolved In and Se ions are incorporated as LiInS2 and LiInSe2 in the anode solid electrolyte interface to facilitate reversible Li deposition/stripping.







Abstract
The two major issues confronting the commercialization of rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reactions on the cathode and inadequate lithium deposition/stripping reversibility on the anode. They are commonly mitigated with additives designed specifically for the anode and the cathode individually. Here, we report the use of a single cathode modifier, In2Se3, which can effectively catalyse the polysulfide reactions on the cathode, and also improve the reversibility of Li deposition and removal on the anode through a LiInS2/LiInSe2 containing solid electrolyte interface formed in situ by the Se and In ions dissolved in the electrolyte. The amounts of dissolved Se and In are small relative to the amount of In2Se3 administered. The benefits of using this single modification approach were verified in Li&#8208;metal anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;S batteries with a Li2S loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low electrolyte/Li2S ratio of 7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The resulting battery showed 60&#8201;% capacity retention after 160&#8197;cycles at the 0.2&#8197;C rate and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.27&#8201;%, comparing very well with recent studies using separate electrode modifiers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral pincer silyl ligand is developed, which enables an Iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction. Key to the success of this transformation relies on using a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the C&#8722;H silylation process with high chem&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation offers an efficient approach for the rapid construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, but remains a significant challenge. Herein, a new type of chiral silyl ligand is developed, which enables the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction of 2&#8208;arylisoquinolines. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, and remarkable yield with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee), delivering enantioenriched axially chiral silane platform molecules with facile convertibility. Key to the success of this unprecedented transformation relies on a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation process with perfect chem&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.

He and his collaborators at the &lt;a href="https://uni-muenster.de/MEET/"&gt;MEET Battery Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://helmholtz-berlin.de"&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f&#252;r Materialien und Energie GmbH (HZB)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://chemie.uni-paderborn.de/en/tiemann"&gt;Paderborn University&lt;/a&gt; recently published a research article about property&#8211;performance relationships of 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Flake- and rod-like shaped particles were evaluated to investigate the impact of the particle morphology of MOFs on electrochemical Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage. By optimization of the particle morphology, the diffusion limitation of the Faradaic process can be significantly reduced. &#8220;Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8211;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for Reversible Lithium-Ion Storage&#8221;, J.&#8197;M.

         <title>Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;norbornadienes with High Energy Densities for Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems can convert, store and release solar energy in chemical bonds, i.e., as chemical energy. In this work, phenyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;norbornadienes are presented as promising MOST systems with very high energy densities. The substrates were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions and their absorption properties and characteristic parameters for MOST applications were investigated. The norbornadiene derivatives showed absorption onsets of up to 386 nm and photoisomerization quantum yields of 56% per photoisomerization event. The resulting quadricyclane products have half&#8208;lifes up to 14 d and very high energy densities of up to 734 KJ/Kg. Overall, these norbornadienes fulfill necessary criteria for an optimal MOST system and are, therefore, a highly promising basis for the development of materials for efficient solar energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk and Surface Contributions to Ionisation Potentials of Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determining the absolute band edge positions in solid materials is crucial for optimising their performance in wide&#8208;ranging applications including photocatalysis and electronic devices. However, obtaining absolute energies is challenging, as seen in CeO2, where experimental measurements show substantial discrepancies in the ionisation potential (IP). Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO2 of only 5.38 eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations from 4.2 eV to 8.2 eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long&#8208;range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Xylene Synthesis Through Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation and Toluene Methylation Over a Composite ZnZrO Zeolite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective synthesis of specific value&#8208;added aromatics from CO2 hydrogenation is of paramount interest for mitigating energy and climate problems caused by CO2 emission. Herein, we report a highly active composite catalyst of ZnZrO and HZSM&#8208;5 (ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG) for xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation via coupling reaction in the presence of toluene, achieving a xylene selectivity of 86.5% with CO2 conversion of 10.5%. A remarkably high space time yield of xylene could reach 215 mg gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, transcending most reported catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The enhanced performance of ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG could be owing to high dispersion and abundant oxygen vacancies of ZZO component for CO2 adsorption, more feasible hydrogen activation and transfer due to the close interaction between two components, and enhanced stability of the formate intermediate. The consumption of methoxy and methanol from the deep hydrogenation of formate by introduced toluene also propels an oriented conversion of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;emissive Iridium(III) Complexes as Phosphorescent Probes with Orthogonal Responses to Analyte Binding and Oxygen Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorescent probes often show sensitive response toward analytes at a specific wavelength. However, oxygen quenching usually occurs at the same wavelength and thus hinders the accurate detection of analytes. In this study, we have developed dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes that exhibit phosphorescence responses to copper(II) ions at a wavelength distinct from that where oxygen quenching occurs. The complexes displayed colorimetric phosphorescence response in aqueous solutions under different copper(II) and oxygen conditions. In cellular imaging, variation in oxygen concentration over a large range from 5% to 80% can modulate the intensity and lifetime of green phosphorescence without affecting the response of red phosphorescence toward intracellular copper(II) ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Aggregation to Chaperon NPs Across Fluid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles (NPs) transfer is usually induced by adding ligands to modify NP surfaces, but aggregation of NPs oftentimes hampers the transfer. Here, we show that aggregation during NP phase transfer does not necessarily result in transfer failure. Using a model system comprising gold NPs and amphiphilic polymers, we demonstrate an unusual mechanism by which NPs can undergo phase transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic phase via a single&#8208;aggregation&#8208;single pathway. Our discovery challenges the conventional idea that aggregation inhibits NP transfer and provides an unexpected pathway for transferring larger&#8208;sized NPs (&gt; 20 nm). The charged amphiphilic polymers effectively act as chaperons for the NP transfer and offer a unique way to manipulate the dispersion and distribution of NPs in two immiscible liquids. Moreover, by intentionally jamming the NP&#8208;polymer assembly at the liquid/liquid interface, the transfer process can be inhibited.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Pt Single Atoms through Pt&#8211;Se Electron Bridges on Vacancy&#8208;enriched Nickel Selenide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts provides a promising strategy to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The enriched vacancies of nickel selenide substrate supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst was prepared via a hydrothermal&#8208;impregnation stepwise approach. Through experimental testation and DFT theoretical calculation, we confirm that Pt single atoms are well loaded at cationic vacancies of nickel selenide with loading of 3.2 wt. %. Moreover, the atomic Pt combined with the high electronegative Se to from Pt&#8208;Se bond as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between single atoms and substrate for fast electron translation. The novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability over 120 h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide support Pt SACs exhibits long&#8208;term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390 mA cm&#8208;2 over 80 h with a retention of 99 %. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atom catalysts with sulfur and epoxy groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions. The presence of sulfur and epoxy groups modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, while the epoxy group also participate in the reduction reaction through reversible cleavage, lowering the energy barrier by functioning as an anchor site for OH* intermediates.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88&#8197;V), Fe single atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89&#8197;V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate&#8208;limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition was first unraveled to mainly result from the phase impurity caused by the relatively easy vanadium volatilization. Consequently, a BiVO4 photoanode free of tetragonal phase and decorated with NiFeOx cocatalyst was fabricated to exhibit a benchmark photocurrent density.







Abstract
Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25&#8197;cm2), demonstrating the advantage of MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Carbonylation of Light and Heavy Hydrocarbons with Carbon Monoxide via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalysis in Flow
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient C&#8722;H functionalization process, enabling the regioselective installation of carbonyls in light and heavy hydrocarbons by using inexpensive carbon monoxide. Safe processing of hazardous CO and flammable alkanes is ensured in flow, with high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics. Our method demonstrates the valorization of gaseous reagents, coupling light alkanes, CO, and an olefin as a terminal radical trap.







Abstract
Despite their abundance in organic molecules, considerable limitations still exist in synthetic methods that target the direct C&#8722;H functionalization at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C&#8722;H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C&#8722;H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8722;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8722;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method was developed for Pt1&#8722;Fe1/nanodiamond dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst construction. Synergistic chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes was achieved, whereby hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is preferentially adsorbed at the Fe1 site. The activation energy is decreased, resulting in an appreciable catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, and a scope of 24 substrates).







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but a great challenge lies in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8722;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8722;N4 sites decorating a nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy of nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and the nitro group is strongly adsorbed on the Fe1 site via a vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, 24 types of substrates). Our findings advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations and open up a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at the atomic level.

         <title>Enhanced Spatial Charge Separation in a Niobium and Tantalum Nitride Core&#8208;Shell Photoanode: In Situ Interface Bonding for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electron/hole separation and collection has been achieved by in situ interface bonding of an ultrathin high&#8208;crystallinity Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell and conductive NbNx nanorod core. The photoanode attains a photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V RHE with a Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the inefficient electron&#8208;hole separation remains a bottleneck that impedes its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a core&#8211;shell nanoarray photoanode of NbNx&#8208;nanorod@Ta3N5 ultrathin layer enhances light harvesting and forms a spatial charge&#8208;transfer channel, which leads to the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. Consequently, an impressive photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE is obtained with an ultrathin Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm, accompanied by excellent stability and a low onset potential (0.46&#8197;VRHE). Mechanistic studies reveal the enhanced performance is attributed to the high&#8208;conductivity NbNx core, high&#8208;crystalline Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell, and the intimate Ta&#8722;N&#8722;Nb interface bonds, which accelerate the charge&#8208;separation capability of the core&#8211;shell photoanode. This study demonstrates the key roles of nanostructure design in improving the efficiency of PEC devices.

Herein, we demonstrate that a core&#8211;shell nanoarray photoanode of NbN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-nanorod@Ta&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ultrathin layer enhances light harvesting and forms a spatial charge-transfer channel, which leads to the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. Consequently, an impressive photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained with an ultrathin Ta&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm, accompanied by excellent stability and a low onset potential (0.46&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;). Mechanistic studies reveal the enhanced performance is attributed to the high-conductivity NbN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; core, high-crystalline Ta&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; mono-grain shell, and the intimate Ta&#8722;N&#8722;Nb interface bonds, which accelerate the charge-separation capability of the core&#8211;shell photoanode. This study demonstrates the key roles of nanostructure design in improving the efficiency of PEC devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Keto&#8208;Switched Photocatalysis of Reconstructed Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local reconstruction of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) unlocks visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution. The keto units in skeletal building blocks are active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons are emitted to Pt nanoparticles across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer for reduction of protons to H2. A new benchmark H2 production rate of 53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
The keto&#8208;switched photocatalysis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient H2 evolution was reported for the first time by engineering, at a molecular level, the local structure and component of the skeletal building blocks. A series of imine&#8208;linked BT&#8208;COFs were synthesized by the Schiff&#8208;base reaction of 1, 3, 5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde with diamines to demonstrate the structural reconstruction of enol to keto configurations by alkaline catalysis. The keto groups of the skeletal building blocks served as active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons were provided to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer. The characterization results, together with density functional theory calculations, indicated clearly that the formation of keto&#8208;injectors not only made the conduction band level more negative, but also led to an inhomogeneous charge distribution in the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular building blocks to form a strong intramolecular built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, visible&#8208;light photocatalysis of TP&#8208;COFs&#8208;1 with one keto group in the skeletal building blocks was successfully enabled and achieved an impressive H2 evolution rate as high as 0.96&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Also, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of the reconstructed BT&#8208;COFs&#8208;2 and &#8208;3 with two and three keto&#8208;injectors were significantly enhanced by alkaline post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autonomous stress&#8208;relaxation by dynamic jammed assemblies of nanoparticles and lipids at the interface was demonstrated. Such a lipid&#8208;based self&#8208;relaxing system may find applications in soft robots, medical and materials applications.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#8901;&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) is shown. The results highlight the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon and show that the presence of bicarbonate dramatically changes the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction of Fe(H2O)62++O2 under physiological and environmental conditions.







Abstract
Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (FeII) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of FeII oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8722;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#8901;&#8722;, H2O2, and HO&#8901;) in FeII oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#8901;&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8722;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; may be expressed as d[CO3&#8901;&#8722;]/dt=[FeII[[O2][HCO3&#8722;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of FeII oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.

         <title>Dynamic Cages&#8212;Towards Nanostructured Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given their chemical and structural variability, dynamic organic and coordination cage architectures are increasingly being used in the formation of more complex systems&#8212;smart materials. In this Review we present basic know&#8208;how for modifying active surfaces with cage systems. The structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the cage used and the potential application of the obtained systems are also discussed.







Abstract
The interest in capsular assemblies such as dynamic organic and coordination cages has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural variability, these systems have found applications in diverse fields of research, including energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, molecular recognition, and live&#8208;cell imaging. In the exploration of the potential of these discrete architectures, they are increasingly being employed in the formation of more complex systems and smart materials. This Review highlights the most promising pathways to overcome common drawbacks of cage systems (stability, recovery) and discusses the most promising strategies for their hybridization with systems featuring various dimensionalities. Following the description of the most recent advances in the fabrication of zero to three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;based systems, this Review will provide the reader with the structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the employed cages and the properties of the materials.

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stable CoII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages are efficient catalysts for photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 in pure water and O2 or air atmospheres. The metal&#8208;nonmetal active site operates synergistically during photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis and the reaction substrate can more fully contact the catalytically active site through host&#8211;guest chemistry of cages, ultimately achieving a high H2O2 production rate.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges, limiting the improvement of its performance. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8722;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for the H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of the photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time; i.e., to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8211;guest chemistry inherent in the metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC)to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytically active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction for efficient ethanol production is challenging. A 2D/2D S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction comprised of black phosphorus and bismuth tungstate (BP/BWO) was constructed for CO2 reduction, coupled with benzylamine (BA) oxidation to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BDA). The catalyst generates ethanol with high yield and selectivity. This work provides insight into heterogeneous photocatalysts based on cooperative photoredox systems.







Abstract
Photoconversion of CO2 and H2O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half&#8208;reaction involving multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), a slow C&#8722;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half&#8208;reaction. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi2WO6 (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as&#8208;prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO2 reduction, with a yield of 61.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethanol (selectivity of 91&#8201;%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S&#8208;scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8722;O&#8722;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron&#8208;rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8722;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H2O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction to C2H5OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO2 photoconversion to C2H5OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing organic materials can absorb externally provided nutrient compounds to modify their sizes, shapes, structures, and properties. This Minireview describes the concept of these materials and their recent progress, including the self&#8208;growing strategies, mass transport mechanisms in growth, simulation models, and potential applications. It provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of this emerging new field.







Abstract
The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms can continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this Minireview, we summarize these materials in terms of six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are grouped into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms. We then explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical for controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterwards, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various applications, including tuning bulk properties, creating textured surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, and others. These examples are then summed up. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.

         <title>Pathway Control of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Supramolecular Polymers by Incorporating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor functionality has been incorporated into the &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomeric structure to program self&#8208;assembly pathways, directing the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as metastable species and slip&#8208;stacked ones as the thermodynamically stable species.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoscale orientation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains challenging due to the complexity of multiple energy landscapes involved in the supramolecular assembly process. In this study, we have developed an effective strategy for programming the pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated supramolecular polymers, by incorporating both electron&#8208;rich methoxy&#8208; or methanthiol&#8208;benzene as donor unit and electron&#8208;poor cyano&#8208;vinylenes as acceptor units on the monomeric structure. It leads to the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the metastable species through homomeric donor/acceptor packing, which convert to slip&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the thermodynamically stable species facilitated by heteromeric donor&#8208;acceptor packing. By further investigating the external seed&#8208;induced kinetic&#8208;to&#8208;thermodynamic transformation behaviors, our findings suggest that the donor&#8208;acceptor functionality on the seed structure is crucial for accelerating pathway conversion. This is achieved by eliminating the initial lag phase in the supramolecular polymerization process. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into designing molecular structures that control aggregation pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures.

         <title>Biselenophene Imide: Enabling Polymer Acceptor with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel distannylated electron&#8208;deficient monomer with high purity and reactivity was synthesized, which enables access to acceptor&#8208;acceptor type polymer acceptor PY5&#8208;BSeI with high molecular weight, planar backbone, narrow band gap, and low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO levels. The polymer shows a high electron mobility and very promising efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
The shortage of narrow band gap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron&#8208;deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI&#8208;Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI&#8208;Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5&#8208;Br, the resulting A&#8211;A polymer PY5&#8208;BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower band gap, deeper&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5&#8208;BSe. Consequently, the PY5&#8208;BSeI&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current of 24.93&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 75.83&#8201;%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70&#8201;%) of the PY5&#8208;BSe&#8208;based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks offers an excellent approach to developing A&#8211;A type polymers for all&#8208;PSCs and even beyond.

&lt;p&gt;A novel distannylated electron-deficient monomer with high purity and reactivity was synthesized, which enables access to acceptor-acceptor type polymer acceptor PY5-BSeI with high molecular weight, planar backbone, narrow band gap, and low-lying LUMO/HOMO levels. The polymer shows a high electron mobility and very promising efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% in all-polymer solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortage of narrow band gap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron-deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI-Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI-Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5-Br, the resulting A&#8211;A polymer PY5-BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower band gap, deeper-lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5-BSe. Consequently, the PY5-BSeI-based all-PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% with a high short-circuit current of 24.93&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and fill factor of 75.83&#8201;%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70&#8201;%) of the PY5-BSe-based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high-performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron-deficient building blocks offers an excellent approach to developing A&#8211;A type polymers for all-PSCs and even beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defluorinative Multi&#8208;Functionalization of Fluoroaryl Sulfoxides Enabled by Fluorine&#8208;Assisted Temporary Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential reactivities of fluoroaryl sulfoxides have been unlocked by precisely constructing and elaborating their temporarily dearomatized intermediates via a robust [5,5]&#8208;sulfonium&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;triggered dearomatization/rearomatization process. Impressively, fluorine has shown its irreplaceable role for the success of the reaction.







Abstract
Owing to its unique physical properties, fluorine is often used to open up new reaction channels. In this report, we establish a cooperation of [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement and fluorine&#8208;assisted temporary dearomatization for arene multi&#8208;functionalization. Specifically, the [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement of fluoroaryl sulfoxides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles generates an intriguing dearomatized sulfonium species which is short&#8208;lived but exhibits unusually high electrophilicity and thus can be instantly trapped by nucleophiles and dienes at a remarkably low temperature (&#8722;95&#8201;&#176;C) to produce four types of valuable multi&#8208;functionalized benzenes, respectively, involving appealing processes of defluorination, desulfurization, and sulfur shift. Mechanistic studies indicate that the use of fluorine on arenes not only circumvents the generally inevitable [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement but also impedes the undesired rearomatization process, thus provides a precious space for constructing and elaborating the temporarily dearomatized fluorinated sulfonium species.

         <title>A Targeting Singlet Oxygen Battery for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Deep&#8208;Tissue Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeting CARG&#8208;1O2 was designed as a &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; for the efficient treatment of MRSA deep&#8208;tissue infections. CARG&#8208;Py was able to store singlet oxygen by pre&#8208;irradiation and produce singlet oxygen over a time course of approximately 30min. CARG&#8208;1O2 potently combats biofilm&#8208;associated infections and disrupts MRSA biofilms, and it exerted a beneficial therapeutic impact in a MRSA&#8208;induced model of pneumonia.







Abstract
Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is dependent on externally applied light and oxygen, and the depth of penetration of these factors can be insufficient for the treatment of deep infections. The short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also limit the antibacterial efficiency of PDT. Herein, we designed a targeting singlet oxygen delivery system, CARG&#8208;Py, for irradiation&#8208;free and oxygen&#8208;free PDT. This system was converted to the &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; CARG&#8208;1O2 and released singlet oxygen without external irradiation or oxygen. CARG&#8208;1O2 is composed of pyridones coupled to a targeting peptide that improves the utilization of singlet oxygen in deep multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. CARG&#8208;1O2 was shown to damage DNA, protein, and membranes by increasing the level of reactive oxygen inside bacteria; the attacking of multiple biomolecular sites caused the death of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An in vivo study in a MRSA&#8208;infected mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated the potential of CARG&#8208;1O2 for the efficient treatment of deep infections. This work provides a new strategy to improve traditional PDT for irradiation&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;free treatment of deep infections while improving convenience of PDT.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Metal Oxide Interactions in Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 Catalysts Drive Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation evolve into a unique nanostructure under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, leading to selective and stable methanol production. Space and time&#8208;resolved operando characterization and simulations reveal that the rapid restructuring process leads to InPdx alloy particles decorated by InOx layers, whose proximity is crucial to avoiding performance losses typically observed when palladium agglomerates.







Abstract
Ternary Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit technological potential for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis, but developing scalable systems and comprehending complex dynamic behaviors of the active phase, promoter, and carrier are key for achieving high productivity. Here, we show that the structure of Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 systems prepared by wet impregnation evolves under CO2 hydrogenation conditions into a selective and stable architecture, independent of the order of addition of Pd and In phases on the zirconia carrier. Detailed operando characterization and simulations reveal a rapid restructuring driven by the metal&#8208;metal oxide interaction energetics. The proximity of InPdx alloy particles decorated by InOx layers in the resulting architecture prevents performance losses associated with Pd sintering. The findings highlight the crucial role of reaction&#8208;induced restructuring in complex CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer insights into the optimal integration of acid&#8208;base and redox functions for practical implementation.

         <title>Multiple Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Chiral Hybrid Antimony Chlorides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;/S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 with excitation&#8208;dependent emission originating from the synergistic effects of ligand and self&#8208;trapped excitons, which exhibit reversible structural transformation between non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;/S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF upon DMF and heat. The application of CPL switch, chiral optical logic gate and anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been investigated based on the multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are ideal for information anti&#8208;countering applications, but the best&#8208;performing materials have not yet been identified. This work presents enantiomorphic hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (1) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (2) showing mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activity with a dissymmetry factor of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3. Interestingly, the DMF&#8208;induced structural transformation is realized to obtain non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (3) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (4) upon exposure to DMF vapor. The transformation process is reversed upon heating. DFT calculations showed that the DMF&#8208;induced&#8208;quenched&#8208;luminescence is attributed to the intersection of the ground and excited state curves on the configuration coordinates. Unexpectedly, the nanocrystals of the chiral antimony halides 1 and 2 were prepared and indicate the excellent solution process performance. The reversible PL and CPL switching gives the system applications in information technology, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption&#8208;decryption, and logic gates.

This work presents enantiomorphic hybrid antimony halides &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) showing mirror-imaged CPL activity with a dissymmetry factor of 1.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Interestingly, the DMF-induced structural transformation is realized to obtain non-emissive &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) upon exposure to DMF vapor. The transformation process is reversed upon heating. DFT calculations showed that the DMF-induced-quenched-luminescence is attributed to the intersection of the ground and excited state curves on the configuration coordinates. Unexpectedly, the nanocrystals of the chiral antimony halides &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were prepared and indicate the excellent solution process performance. The reversible PL and CPL switching gives the system applications in information technology, anti-counterfeiting, encryption-decryption, and logic gates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Bond Cyclopropenylation with Cyclopropenium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules enables the installation of cyclopropene rings with excellent efficiency, thus reaching an uncharted cyclopropenylated chemical space. The cyclopropene ring generally improves the metabolic stability of the cyclopropenylated drug molecules and serves as a unique scaffold to access broad range of medically&#8208;relevant motifs.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and chemoselective late&#8208;stage (hetero)aryl C&#8722;H bond cyclopropenylation with cyclopropenium cations (CPCs). The process is fast, operationally simple and shows an excellent functional group tolerance in densely&#8208;functionalized drug molecules, natural products, agrochemicals and fluorescent dyes. Moreover, we discovered that the installation of the cyclopropene ring in drug molecules could not only be used to shield against metabolic instability but also as a synthetic tool to reach medicinally&#8208;relevant sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds exploiting the highly&#8208;strained nature of the cyclopropene ring with known transformations.

         <title>Mild Synthesis of Polychlorinated Arenes for Efficient Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polychlorinated (hetero)arenes have shown great promise for organic optoelectronics applications. However, the harsh synthesis of polychlorinated compounds and the possible luminescence quenching from the compact intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking induced by chlorine atoms limit their investigations and applications in luminescent materials. Herein, two isomeric polychlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds JY&#8208;1&#8208;Cl and JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl consisting of rigidified aryl ketones and amine are designed and synthesized under mild conditions through nucleophilic chlorination intermediated by electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. Among them, due to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions induced by chlorine atoms, JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl exhibits bright monomer and dimer emissions with dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characters. Notably, in compared with the non&#8208;chlorinated compounds, high photoluminescence quantum yield is well maintained after introducing multiple chlorine atoms in JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl. Eventually, the first dual&#8208;TADF organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are also successfully fabricated with maximum external quantum efficiency as high as 29.1% employing JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl as emitter. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of polychlorinated amine&#8208;carbonyl PAHs and demonstrates the great potential of the chlorinated materials for luminescent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear&#8208;scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co&#8211;Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of ~11% and ~57% were achieved under magnetic field (0.2 T) and light irradiation (100 mW.cm&#8722;2), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, &#414; = 0.6 V at pH 7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli&#8208;sensitive spin crossover&#8208;based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Imaging of Nascent DNA in Live Cells by Monitoring the Fluorescence Lifetime of DNA&#8208;Incorporated Thiazole Orange&#8208;Modified Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modified 2'&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate derivative (dCTOTP) bearing thiazole orange moiety tethered via an oligoethylene glycol linker was designed and synthesized. The nucleotide was found to incorporate into DNA by DNA polymerases in vitro as well as in live cells. Upon incorporation of dCTOTP into DNA, the thiazole orange moiety exhibited a fluorescence lifetime that differed significantly from the non&#8208;incorporated (i.e. free and non&#8208;covalently intercalated) forms of dCTOTP. When dCTOTP was delivered into live U&#8208;2 OS cells using a synthetic nucleoside triphosphate transporter, it allowed us to distinguish and monitor in real time the cells that were actively synthesizing DNA from the very first moments after treatment. We anticipate that this probe can be used to study chromatin organization and dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;Responsive Zinc Ionophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transmission of chemical information between cells and across lipid bilayer membranes is of profound significance in many biological processes. The design of synthetic signaling systems is a critical step towards preparing artificial cells with collective behaviour. Here, we report the first example of a synthetic inter&#8208;vesicle signaling system, in which diffusible chemical signals trigger transmembrane ion transport in a manner reminiscent of signaling pathways in biology. The system is derived from novel ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl and BODIPY photo&#8208;caged Zn(II) transporters, in which cation transport is triggered by photo&#8208;decaging with UV or red light, respectively. This decaging reaction can be used to trigger the release of the cationophores from a small population of sender vesicles. This in turn triggers the transport of ions across the membrane of a larger population of receiver vesicles, but not across the sender vesicle membrane, leading to overall inter&#8208;vesicle signal transduction and amplification.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Manufacturing of Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers by Stress&#8208;Induced Alignment and Hydrogen Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid elastomers (LCEs) capable of performing large and reversible deformation in response to an external stimulus are an important class of soft actuators. However, their manufacturing process typically undergoes a multistep approach that requires harsh conditions. For the very first time, LCEs with customized geometries that can be manufactured via a rapid one&#8208;step approach at room temperature are developed. The LCEs are hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) crosslinked main chain polymers comprising flexible short side chains. Applying a stretching/shear force to the LCE can simultaneously induce mesogen alignment and H&#8208;bond exchange, allowing for the formation of well&#8208;aligned LCE network stabilized by H&#8208;bonds. Based on this working principle, soft actuators in fibers and 2D/3D objects can be manufactured via mechanical stretching or melt extrusion within a short time (e.g., &lt; 1 min). These actuators can perform reversible macroscopic motions with large, controlled deformations up to 38%. The dynamic nature of H&#8208;bonds also provides the actuators with reprocessability and reprogrammability. Thus, this work opens the way for the one&#8208;step and custom manufacturing of soft actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100% under high humid condition (75% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804; 7.1%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8208;O&#8208;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57 eV lower than dry conditions).</dc:description>

         <title>Gradually Tuning the Flexibility of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks via Stepwise Structural Transformation and Their Flexibility&#8208;Dependent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing for their dynamic properties distinctive from rigid counterparts but still suffer from limited accessibility. Especially, controlling flexibility of COFs is challenging and the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs has rarely been unveiled. This article reports stepwise adjustment on flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional COFs, which is realized by the designed synthesis of rigid COF (R&#8208;COF), semi&#8208;flexible COF (SF&#8208;COF), and flexible COF (F&#8208;COF) through polymerization, linker exchange, and linkage conversion with a newly developed method for reduction of hydrazone, respectively. Significant difference in breathing behavior and self&#8208;adaptive capability of the three COFs are uncovered through vapor response and iodine capture experiments. Gas sorption experiments indicate that the porosity of F&#8208;COF could switch from "close" state in nitrogen to "open" state in carbon dioxide, which are not observed for R&#8208;COF and SF&#8208;COF. This study not only develops a strategy to adjust the flexibility of COFs by tuning their linkers and linkages, but also provides a deep insight into the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs, which lays a foundation for the development of this new class of dynamic porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Anti&#8208;Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumor and produce cytotoxic species, therefore are promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature that enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposome. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of intermediate product H2O2 as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in anti&#8208;tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered a potential alternative to high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high reactivity of metallic sodium towards common liquid organic electrolytes renders such battery technology particularly challenging. Herein, we propose a multi&#8208;block single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) doped with ethylene carbonate as suitable electrolyte system for SMBs. This novel SIPE provides a very high ionic conductivity (2.6 mS cm&#8208;1) and an electrochemical stability window of about 4.1 V at 40 &#176;C, enabling stable sodium stripping and plating and excellent rate capability of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells up to 2C. Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective Zweifel olefination using boronate complexes carrying two different reactive &#960;&#8208;systems was achieved to synthesize vinyl heteroarenes and conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes in good yield and up to 100% stereoselectivity, which remains unexplored until now. Most importantly, we report the unprecedented formation of E vs. Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes for different heteroarenes under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) investigations unveil the mechanistic dichotomy between olefin and heteroarene activation followed by 1,2&#8208;migration, leading to E or Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes respectively. We also report a previously unknown reversal of stereoselectivity by using 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as an electrophile. The Zweifel olefination using a boronate complex that carries two different olefins was previously unexplored due to significant challenges associated with the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins. We have solved this problem and reported the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing F/P Hybrid Polymer as Ultrastable Cationic Shielding&#160;Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendrite growth on electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase has severely limited applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we developed an ionic alternating polymer with fluorocarbons and phosphonium cations in repeating units to regulate Li deposition for the first time. The combined functionalities in the F/P hybrid polymer exhibit remarkable characteristics as a protective layer on top of Li anode, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical stability, ion flux redistributing capability and adaptive chain mobility. Based on characterizations and simulations, this cationic interlayer could effectively furnish long&#8208;standing electrostatic shielding for anodes, allowing restrained coating decomposition and homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, and enabling full cells with enhanced rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Given the importance of LMBs, this work will promote polymer design to stabilize anodes with superior electrochemical behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;defect MOF which incorporates both linker defect and cluster defects as a new type of sulfur catalyst to achieve targeted and synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of polysulfides.







Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Accelerated conversion by catalysis can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced Li&#8722;S performance. However, a catalyst with single active site cannot simultaneously accelerate multiple LiPSs conversion. Herein, we developed a novel dual&#8208;defect (missing linker and missing cluster defects) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new type of catalyst to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of LiPSs. Electrochemical tests and first&#8208;principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that different defects can realize targeted acceleration of stepwise reaction kinetics for LiPSs. Specifically, the missing linker defects can selectively accelerate the conversion of S8&#8594;Li2S4, while the missing cluster defects can catalyze the reaction of Li2S4&#8594;Li2S, so as to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. Hence, the Li&#8722;S battery with an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivers a capacity of 1087&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after 100&#8197;cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 12.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and E/S=3.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1, an areal capacity of 10.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 45&#8197;cycles can still be obtained.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher&#8208;Order Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical cyclic peptides constructed by dynamic covalent chemistry provide a platform for the investigation of naturally occurring chirality inversion, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, and hierarchical assembly. The insertion of a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. The reversibility can be tuned by changing the pH value without producing other chemical waste except water.







Abstract
Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulting asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures. Different from traditional cyclic D,L peptides, the formation of 4&#8208;imidazolidinone promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. Analysis of the nanostructures confirmed the left&#8208;handedness, representing chirality induced self&#8208;assembly. This proves that a rationally designed peptide can mimic multiple natural phenomena and could promote the development of functional biomaterials, catalysts, antibiotics, and supermolecules.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Kevin Li and Liliya Yatsunyk, Swarthmore College PA (USA) and by John Schneekloth, Jr, (Jay) National Cancer Institute, Frederick MD (USA). They recently published an article on the first crystal structure of an intercalated motif (i&#8208;motif or iM) from the HRAS oncogene involved in many cancers.

The structure is unique in that only two base pairs out of 20 are canonical. The extensive network of capping and connecting interactions is unprecedented. The unique structural elements (loops/connecting region) may be targeted by ligands or proteins as cancer therapies. iHRAS represents the first crystallized iM&#8208;forming structure from a human promoter. &#8220;Crystal Structure of an iM from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter&#8221;, K.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing indolyldimethanols as four&#8208;carbon platform molecules for enantioselective cycloadditions is like climbing a higher peak of the mountain: full of challenges but exciting. In their Research Article (e202305450), Shao&#8208;Fei Ni, Wei Tan, Feng Shi et&#8197;al. describe catalytic asymmetric (4+n) cycloadditions of indolyldimethanols, leading to the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, for which a two&#8208;step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Z&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System Under the Bias&#8208;Free Condition for CO&#8322; Reduction Coupled with&#160;Water Oxidation: Photocatalytic Production of CO/HCOOH and H&#8322;O&#8322;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;inspired molecular&#8208;engineered systems have been extensively investigated for the half&#8208;reactions of H2O oxidation or CO2 reduction with sacrificial electron donors/acceptors. However, there has yet to be reported a device for dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photoanodes coupled with molecular photocathodes in an aqueous solution without the use of sacrificial reagents. Herein, we will report the integration of Sn(IV)&#8208; or Al(III)&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (SnTPyP or AlTPyP) decorated tin oxide particles (SnTPyP/SnO2 or AlTPyP/SnO2) photoanode with the dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photocathode on nickel oxide particles containing [Ru(diimine)3]2+ as the light&#8208;harvesting unit and [Ru(diimine)(CO)2Cl2] as the catalyst unit covalently connected and fixed within poly&#8208;pyrrole layer (RuCAT&#8208;RuC2&#8208;PolyPyr&#8208;PRu/NiO). The simultaneous irradiation of the two photoelectrodes with visible light resulted in H2O2 on the anode and mainly HCOOH with CO and H2 as minor products on the cathode with high Faradaic efficiencies in purely aqueous conditions without any applied bias is the first example of artificial photosynthesis with only two&#8208;electron redox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquids with Permanent Macroporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Permanent macropores (&gt;50 nm) had not been reported in the liquid state until a recent report by Tao Li and coworkers, describing a synthetic strategy to form a porous liquid with dual micro&#8208;macroporosity. This is prepared by producing hierarchically porous particles that are surface coated and fluidised by dispersion. Surface micropores enable permanent porosity by steric exclusion of the fluid phase. The material has a considerable water uptake capacity (27% w/w) due to large (480 nm) unoccupied macropores. This also enables switching of thermal conductivity on uptake of water. These are new properties translated from porous solids to the liquid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Correlation of Cross&#8208;linking Modes with Mechanical Properties for Dynamic Polymeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneously introducing covalent and supramolecular cross&#8208;links into one system to construct dually cross&#8208;linked networks, has been proved an effective approach to prepare high&#8208;performance materials. However, so far, features and advantages of dually cross&#8208;linked networks compared with those possessing individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linking points are rarely investigated. Herein, on the basis of comparison between supramolecular polymer network (SPN), covalent polymer network (CPN) and dually cross&#8208;linked polymer network (DPN), we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking strategy can endow the DPN with integrated advantages of CPN and SPN. Benefiting from the energy dissipative ability along with the dissociation of host&#8722;guest complexes, the DPN shows excellent toughness and ductility similar to the SPN. Meanwhile, the elasticity of covalent cross&#8208;links in the DPN could rise the structural stability to a level comparable to the CPN, exhibiting quick deformation recovery capacity. Moreover, the DPN has the strongest breaking stress and puncture resistance among the three, proving the unique property advantages of dual cross&#8208;linking method. These findings gained from our study further deepen the understanding of dynamic polymeric networks and facilitate the preparation of high&#8208;performance elastomeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin Supramolecule as Surface Carrier Modulator Imparts Hole Transporter with Enhanced Mobility for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the surface charge transport behavior of hole transport materials (HTMs) would be as an potential approach to improve their hole mobility, while yet realized for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an oxygen bridged dimer&#8208;based monoamine Fe(III) porphyrin supramolecule is prepared and doped in HTM film. Theoretical analyses reveal that the polaron distributed on dimer can be coupled with the parallel arranged polarons on adjacent dimers. This polaron coupling at the interface of supramolecule and HTM can resonates with hole flux to increase hole transport efficiency. Mobility tests reveal that the hole mobility of doped HTM film is improved by 8&#8208;fold. Doped perovskite device exhibits an increased efficiency from 19.8% to 23.2%, and greatly improved stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the mobility of HTMs by surface carrier modulation, therefore fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;iG: Simultaneous Enrichment and Profiling of Intact N&#8208;linked, O&#8208;GalNAc, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Glycopeptides</title>

         <dc:description>
A glycoproteomics platform, Click&#8208;iG, is reported that integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides.







Abstract
Proteins are ubiquitously modified with glycans of varied chemical structures through distinct glycosidic linkages, making the landscape of protein glycosylation challenging to map. Profiling of intact glycopeptides with mass spectrometry (MS) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for revealing matched information of the glycosylation sites and attached glycans (i.e., intact glycosites), but is largely limited to individual glycosylation types. Herein, we describe Click&#8208;iG, which integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides. We demonstrate the utility of Click&#8208;iG by the identification of thousands of intact glycosites in cell lines and living mice. From the mouse lung, heart, and spleen, a total of 2053 intact N&#8208;glycosites, 262 intact O&#8208;GalNAc glycosites, and 1947 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation sites were identified. Click&#8208;iG&#8208;enabled comprehensive coverage of the protein glycosylation landscape lays the foundation for interrogating crosstalk between different glycosylation pathways.

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast, low&#8208;cost parahydrogen&#8208;hyperpolarization via Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) enables in vivo metabolic magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate the first in vivo application of SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 in a purified, aqueous solution with &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;%, obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering. This achievement paves the way for affordable and widespread metabolic imaging applications.







Abstract
Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6&#8197;minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;% (residual 250&#8197;mM methanol and 20&#8197;&#956;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.

         <title>Infrared Multiphoton Dissociation Enables Top&#8208;Down Characterization of Membrane Protein Complexes and G Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top&#8208;down mass spectrometry using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) of native membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides good sequence coverage from native protein ions. We observe successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids, specifically within transmembrane helices, enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are challenging to analyze by native mass spectrometry (MS) as their hydrophobic nature typically requires stabilization in detergent micelles that are removed prior to analysis via collisional activation. There is however a practical limit to the amount of energy which can be applied, which often precludes subsequent characterization by top&#8208;down MS. To overcome this barrier, we have applied a modified Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to an infrared laser within a high&#8208;pressure linear ion trap. We show how tuning the intensity and time of incident photons enables liberation of membrane proteins from detergent micelles. Specifically, we relate the ease of micelle removal to the infrared absorption of detergents in both condensed and gas phases. Top&#8208;down MS via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), results in good sequence coverage enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes. By contrasting and comparing the fragmentation patterns of the ammonia channel with two class A GPCRs, we identify successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids within transmembrane domains. Using gas&#8208;phase molecular dynamics simulations, we show that areas prone to fragmentation maintain aspects of protein structure at increasing temperatures. Altogether, we propose a rationale to explain why and where in the protein fragment ions are generated.

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts, a judicious combination of ion&#8208;pair elements with peptide scaffolds that bear multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors, have captivated considerable attention for their unprecedented performance in a plethora of enantioselective transformations, in many cases enabling never&#8208;before&#8208;seen patterns of reactivity and selectivity. In this context, we provide a succinct overview of recent progress in this field.







Abstract
Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Toward Sustainable Metal&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Materials, Electrochemistry and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes three types of iodine cathodes with their reaction mechanisms and highlights progress of various metal anodes and optimization strategies in metal&#8208;iodine batteries. The possibility of alternate metal anodes and their design strategy is enlightened. To build sustainable batteries, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues.







Abstract
Due to the natural abundance of iodine, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainability, metal&#8208;iodine batteries are competitive for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density, and large power density. However, the inherent properties of iodine such as electronic insulation and shuttle behavior of soluble iodine species affect negatively rate performance, cyclability, and self&#8208;discharge behavior of metal&#8208;iodine batteries, while the dendrite growth and metal corrosion on the anode side brings potential safety hazards and inferior durability. These problems of metal&#8208;iodine system still exist and need to be solved urgently. Herein, we summarize the research progress of metal&#8208;iodine batteries in the past decades. Firstly, the classification, design strategy and reaction mechanism of iodine electrode are briefly outlined. Secondly, the current development and protection strategy of conventional metal anodes in metal&#8208;iodine batteries are highlighted, and some potential anode materials and their design strategies are proposed. Thirdly, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues for realizing next&#8208;generation iodine&#8208;based energy storage systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to promote the development of metal&#8208;iodine batteries and provide guidelines for their design.

         <title>An Interfacial View of Cation Effects on Electrocatalysis Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolytes has been recently introduced as a crucial factor to tailor the kinetics and Faradaic efficiency of many electrocatalytic reactions. In this Minireview, we have summarized the recent advances in the molecular&#8208;level understanding of cation effects on relevant electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) reactions. The discussion covers the effects of electrolyte cations on interfacial electric fields, structural organization of interfacial water molecules, blocking the catalytic active sites, stabilization or destabilization of intermediates, and interfacial pHs. These cation&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena have been reported to impact the performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) of electrochemical reactions collaboratively or independently. We describe that although there is almost a general agreement on the relationship between the size of alkali cations and the activities of HER, OER, and CO2RR, however, the mechanism by which the performance of these electrocatalytic reactions is influenced by alkali metal cations is still in debate.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular alcohol click chemistry enables facile synthesis of recyclable polymers with tunable structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers derived from sustainable feedstocks presents enormous challenges. Here, we develop a novel, modular, and efficient click reaction for connecting primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols with activated alkenes via a bridge molecule of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The click reaction is successfully applied to synthesize a series of recyclable polymers by the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS. Diols and diacrylates are common chemicals and can be produced from biorenewable sources, and COS is released as the industrial waste. In addition to sustainable monomers, the approach is atom&#8208;economical, wide in scope, metal&#8208;free, and performed under mild conditions, affording unprecedented polymers with nearly quantitative yields. The produced polymers also possess predesigned and widely tunable structure owing to the versatility of our method and the broad variety of monomers. The in&#8208;chain thiocarbonate and ester polar groups can play as breakpoints, allowing these polymers to be easily recycled. Overall, the polymers have broad prospects for green materials given their facile synthesis, readily available feedstocks, desirable performance, and chemical recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Homo&#8208;Mannich Reaction Strategy Enables Collective Access to Ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with iminium ion generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core, which is shared by a variety of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids across families. Through this skeleton&#8208;constructing process, an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center as well as an allyl and a ketone groups were installed. Using this functionalized hydrocarbazole as the structural platform, D ring and E rings of different sizes (i.e., five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered) were successively or simultaneously assembled, leading to a collective asymmetric synthesis of seven alkaloids belonging to the ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloid families.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilm&#8208;associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant&#8208;associated infections, making them a major public&#8208;health concern. Early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early&#8208;stage and matured&#8208;biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet&#8208;printing, forming a part of near&#8208;field&#8208;communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly&#8208;conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8208;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time presents the evidence showcasing that electrons released through the actions of bacteria can be harnessed to convert AgCl to Ag, thus enabling the wireless, battery&#8208;less, and chip&#8208;less early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific m6A Erasing via Conditionally Stabilized CRISPR&#8208;Cas13b Editor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) on RNAs plays an important role in regulating various biological processes and CRIPSR technology has been employed for programmable m6A editing. However, the bulky size of CRISPR protein and constitutively expressed CRISPR/RNA editing enzymes can interfere with the native function of target RNAs and cells. Herein, we reported a conditional m6A editing platform (FKBP*&#8208;dCas13b&#8208;ALK) based on a ligand stabilized dCas13 editor. The inducible expression of this m6A editing system was achieved by adding or removing the Shield&#8208;1 molecule. We further demonstrated that the targeted recruitment of dCas13b&#8208;m6A eraser fusion protein and site&#8208;specific m6A erasing were achieved under the control of Shield&#8208;1. Moreover, the release and degradation of dCas13b fusion protein occurred faster than the restoration of m6A on the target RNAs after Shield&#8208;1 removal, which provides an ideal opportunity to study the m6A function with minimal steric interference from bulky dCas13b fusion protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficiencies of Various in&#8208;situ Polymerizations of Liquid Electrolytes and the Practical Implications for Quasi Solid&#8208;state Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ polymerization of liquid electrolytes is currently the most feasible way for constructing solid&#8208;state batteries, which, however, is affected by various interfering factors of reactions and so the electrochemical performance of cells. To disclose the effects from polymerization conditions, two types of generally used in&#8208;situ polymerizing reactions of ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and double bond radical polymerization (DBRP) were investigated on the aspects of monomer conversion and electrochemical properties (Li+&#8208;conductivity and interfacial stability). The ROP generated poly&#8208;ester and poly&#8208;carbonate show a high monomer conversion of ~90%, but suffer a poor Li+&#8208;conductivity of lower than 2 &#215; 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature (RT). Additionally, the terminal alkoxy anion derived from the ROP is not resistant to high&#8208;voltage cathodes. While, the DBRP produced poly&#8208;VEC(vinyl ethylene carbonate) and poly&#8208;VC(vinylene carbonate) show lower monomer conversions of 50&#8208;80%, delivering relatively higher Li+&#8208;conductivities of 2 x 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at RT. Compared two polymerizing reactions and four monomers, the VEC&#8208;based F&#8208;containing copolymer possesses advantages in Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidant capacity, which also shows simultaneous stability towards Li&#8208;metal with the help of LiF&#8208;based passivating layer, allowing a long&#8208;term stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage quasi solid&#8208;state cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Searching the Chemical Space of Bicyclic Dienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Candidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitches are molecular systems that are chemically
transformed subsequent to interaction with light and they
find potential application in many new technologies. The
design and discovery of photoswitch candidates require intricate
molecular engineering of a range of properties to optimize
a candidate to a specific applications, a task which
can be tackled efficiently using quantum chemical screening
procedures. In this paper, we perform a large scale screening
of approximately half a million bicyclic diene photoswitches
in the context of molecular solar thermal energy storage
using ab initio quantum chemical methods. We further device
an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on
their predicted solar energy conversion efficiency and elucidate
potential pitfalls of this approach. Our search through
the chemical space of bicyclic dienes reveals systems with
unprecedented solar energy conversion efficiencies and storage
densities that show promising design guidelines for next
generation molecular solar thermal energy storage systems</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoswitches are molecular systems that are chemically
transformed subsequent to interaction with light and they
find potential application in many new technologies. The
design and discovery of photoswitch candidates require intricate
molecular engineering of a range of properties to optimize
a candidate to a specific applications, a task which
can be tackled efficiently using quantum chemical screening
procedures. In this paper, we perform a large scale screening
of approximately half a million bicyclic diene photoswitches
in the context of molecular solar thermal energy storage
using ab initio quantum chemical methods. We further device
an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on
their predicted solar energy conversion efficiency and elucidate
potential pitfalls of this approach. Our search through
the chemical space of bicyclic dienes reveals systems with
unprecedented solar energy conversion efficiencies and storage
densities that show promising design guidelines for next
generation molecular solar thermal energy storage systems&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Nuclearity&#8208;Dependent Enantiodivergent Epoxide Opening via Enthalpy&#8208;Controlled Mononuclear and Entropy&#8208;Controlled Dinuclear (Salen)Titanium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed, in which both antipodes of chiral alcohol products are selectively accessed by mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Kinetic studies based on the Eyring equation revealed an enthalpy&#8208;controlled enantio&#8208;differentiation mode in mononuclear catalysis, whereas an entropy&#8208;controlled one in dinuclear catalysis. DFT calculations outline the origin of the enantiocontrol of the mononuclear catalysis and indicate the actual catalyst species in the dinuclear catalytic system. The mechanistic insights may shed a light on a strategy for stereoswichable asymmetric catalysis utilizing nuclearity&#8208;distinct transition&#8208;metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Ruthenium Content Confined on Boron Carbon Nitride as an Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, only a few noble metal oxides exhibit the required efficiency and stability as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under the acidic, high&#8208;voltage conditions that exist during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). The high cost and scarcity of these catalysts hinder the large&#8208;scale application of PEMWE. Here, we report a novel OER electrocatalyst for OER comprised of uniformly dispersed Ru clusters confined on boron carbon nitride (BCN) support. Compared to RuO2, our BCN&#8208;supported catalyst shows enhanced charge transfer. It displays a low overpotential of 164 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, suggesting its excellent OER catalytic activity. This catalyst was able to operate continuously for over 12 h under acidic conditions, whereas RuO2 without any support fails in 1 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the interaction between the N on BCN support and Ru clusters changes the adsorption capacity and reduces the OER energy barrier, which increases the electrocatalytic activity of Ru.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Interlayer Distance and Heteroatom&#8208;Doping of Graphite Provide New Insights into the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Mechanism in Dual&#8208;Carbon Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, it is still questionable how material structures affect the anion storage behavior. In this paper, we synthesis graphite with an ultra&#8208;large interlayer distance and heteroatomic doping to systematically investigate the combined effects on DIBs. The large interlayer distance of 0.51 nm provides more space for anion storage, while the doping of the heteroatoms reduces the energy barriers for anion intercalation and migration and enhances rapid ionic storage at interfaces simultaneously. Based on the synergistic effects, the DIBs composed of carbon cathode and lithium anode afford ultra&#8208;high capacity of 240 mA h g&#8208;1 at current density of 100 mA g&#8208;1. Dual&#8208;carbon batteries (DCBs) using the graphite as both of cathode and anode steadily cycle 2400 times at current density of 1 A g&#8208;1. Hence, this work provides a reference to the strategy of material designs of DIBs and DCBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Degradation Pathways of Polymers by Radical&#8208;Triggered Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the radical behaviours during polymer degradation is beneficial to unveil and regulate the degradation pathways of polymers to achieve a sustainable polymer development. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to study radical behaviours owing to the ultra&#8208;short lifetime of the transient radicals generated during the polymer degradation. In this contribution, we have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to&#160;monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation without/with the addition of inorganic additives. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from peroxy radicals (ROO&#8226;) emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways with the addition of additives, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with positively charged Al centers, could be modulated into a double sigmoidal dynamics, involving a main product of alkoxy radicals&#160;&#160;(RO&#8226;) with the activation energy of 40.2 kJ/mol and a small amount of&#160;&#160;ROO&#8226; with 76.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Accordingly, the polymers with the additive&#8208;regulated pathways could exhibit prominently anti&#8208;degradation behaviours. This work is beneficial for the deep understanding of the radical mechanisms during polymer degradation, and for the rational design of anti&#8208;degradation polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ketyl Radical Anion Mediated Radical Polymerization and Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization to Give Polymers with Low Molecular Weight Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One ketyl radical anion can enable a 3&#8211;3 coupling reaction, radical polymerization at a carbon radical site, and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at an oxygen anion site. This results in simultaneous organic synthesis and polymerization in one pot; thereby cyclopentane derivates and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of novel polymerization capable of yielding polymers with low molecular weight distribution (&#272;) is essential and significant in polymer chemistry, where monofunctional initiator contains only one initiation site in these polymerizations generally. Here, ketyl radical anion species is introduced to develop a novel Ketyl Mediated Polymerization (KMP), which enables radical polymerization at carbon radical site and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at oxygen anion site, respectively. Meanwhile, polymerization and corresponding organic synthesis generally couldn't be performed simultaneously in one pot. Through KMP, organic synthesis and polymerization are achieved in one pot, where small molecules (cyclopentane derivates) and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild condition simultaneously. At the initiation step, both organic synthesis and polymerization are initiated by single electron transfer reaction with ketyl radical anion formation. Cyclopentane derivates are synthesized through 3&#8211;3 coupling reaction and cyclization. Polystyrene and polycaprolactone with low &#272; and a full monomer conversion are prepared by KMP via radical polymerization and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, respectively. This work therefore enables both organic synthesis and two different polymerizations from same initiation system, which saves time, labour, resource and energy and expands the reaction mode and method libraries of organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.

         <title>B7Be6B7: A Boron&#8208;Beryllium Sandwich Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a previously unknown sandwich&#8208;type complex consisting of beryllium and boron, which exhibits remarkable thermochemical and kinetical stability and displays aromatic characteristics. Through chemical bonding analysis, we show that B7Be6B7 can be conceptualized as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex.







Abstract
Planar boron clusters have often been regarded as &#8220;&#960;&#8208;analogous&#8221; to aromatic arenes because of their similar delocalized &#960;&#8208;bonding. However, unlike arenes such as C5H5&#8722; and C6H6, boron clusters have not previously shown the ability to form sandwich complexes. In this study, we present the first sandwich complex involving beryllium and boron, B7Be6B7. The global minimum of this combination adopts a unique architecture having a D6h geometry, featuring an unprecedented monocyclic Be6 ring sandwiched between two quasi&#8208;planar B7 motifs. The thermochemical and kinetic stability of B7Be6B7 can be attributed to strong electrostatic and covalent interactions between the fragments. Chemical bonding analysis shows that B7Be6B7 can be considered as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex. Moreover, there is a significant electron delocalization within this cluster, supported by the local diatropic contributions of the B7 and Be6 fragments.

&lt;p&gt;We report the discovery of a previously unknown sandwich-type complex consisting of beryllium and boron, which exhibits remarkable thermochemical and kinetical stability and displays aromatic characteristics. Through chemical bonding analysis, we show that B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; can be conceptualized as a [B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;[Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planar boron clusters have often been regarded as &#8220;&#960;-analogous&#8221; to aromatic arenes because of their similar delocalized &#960;-bonding. However, unlike arenes such as C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, boron clusters have not previously shown the ability to form sandwich complexes. In this study, we present the first sandwich complex involving beryllium and boron, B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. The global minimum of this combination adopts a unique architecture having a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; geometry, featuring an unprecedented monocyclic Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ring sandwiched between two quasi-planar B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; motifs. The thermochemical and kinetic stability of B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; can be attributed to strong electrostatic and covalent interactions between the fragments. Chemical bonding analysis shows that B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; can be considered as a [B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;[Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex. Moreover, there is a significant electron delocalization within this cluster, supported by the local diatropic contributions of the B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; fragments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of [15N3]Metronidazole: A Clinically Approved Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[15N3]Metronidazole (MNZ) is an emerging hyperpolarized contrast agent. The dynamic nuclear polarization process of this clinically used antibiotic is very fast compared to many other 15N&#8208;labeled molecules and has remarkably long T1 and T2. The hyperpolarized signal of MNZ lasted for over a minute in a rat brain. Future work on hyperpolarized MNZ will investigate its potential as an antibiotic or hypoxia&#8208;sensing probe in disease models.







Abstract
We report dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) of [15N3]metronidazole ([15N3]MNZ) for the first time. Metronidazole is a clinically approved antibiotic, which can be potentially employed as a hypoxia&#8208;sensing molecular probe using 15N hyperpolarized (HP) nucleus. The DNP process is very efficient for [15N3]MNZ with an exponential build&#8208;up constant of 13.8&#8197;min using trityl radical. After dissolution and sample transfer to a nearby 4.7&#8197;T Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, HP [15N3]MNZ lasted remarkably long with T1 values up to 343&#8197;s and 15N polarizations up to 6.4&#8201;%. A time series of HP [15N3]MNZ images was acquired in vitro using a steady state free precession sequence on the 15NO2 peak. The signal lasted over 13&#8197;min with notably long T2 of 20.5&#8197;s. HP [15N3]MNZ was injected in the tail vein of a healthy rat, and dynamic spectroscopy was performed over the rat brain. The in vivo HP 15N signals persisted over 70&#8197;s, demonstrating an unprecedented opportunity for in vivo studies.

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify ruthenium&#8208;promoted allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in live A549 human lung cells. Individual turn&#8208;on events were detected as single fluorescence spots and found to occur more frequently in the mitochondria than the rest of the cell. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution is an important consideration in designing intracellular catalysts.







Abstract
Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Assisted Microfluidic Platform Enables Single&#8208;Cell Metabolite Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic platform integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing immobilized enzymes is reported. The platform could not only offer over 99&#8201;% single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency but also dynamically monitor the single&#8208;cell state by profiling the cellular metabolites glucose and extracellular lactate, thus allowing the evaluation of cell tumorigenic potential in unprocessed whole blood.







Abstract
Colonization of cancer cells at secondary sites, a decisive step in tumor metastasis, is strongly dependent on the formation of metastatic microenvironments regulated by intrinsic single&#8208;cell metabolism traits. Herein, we report a single&#8208;cell microfluidic platform for high&#8208;throughput dynamic monitoring of tumor cell metabolites to evaluate tumor malignancy. This microfluidic device empowers efficient isolation of single cells (&gt;99&#8201;%) in a squashed state similar to tumor extravasation, and employs enzyme&#8208;packaged metal&#8211;organic frameworks to catalyze tumor cell metabolites for visualization. The microfluidic evaluation was confirmed by in vivo assays, suggesting that the platform allowed predicting the tumorigenicity of captured tumor cells and screening metabolic inhibitors as anti&#8208;metastatic drugs. Furthermore, the platform efficiently detected various aggressive cancer cells in unprocessed whole blood samples with high sensitivity, showing potential for clinical application.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Oxidation by a Porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Cation Radical Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex without ancillary proton accepting ligand/groups was found to perform oxidative C&#8722;H bond activation, yielding hydroxylated substrates in the presence of air. According to kinetic studies, the nickel porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted an electron to oxidise substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism.







Abstract
Heme and chlorin &#960;&#8208;cation radical oxidants are widely implicated in biological and synthetic oxidation catalysis. Little insight into the role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals in proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation is available. We prepared a NiII&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation complex ([NiII(P&#8901;+)]) and found it to be capable of the oxidation of a variety of simple hydrocarbon substrates. Interestingly, some of the products were hydroxylated, with ([NiII(P&#8901;+)]) working in concert with atmospheric O2 to yield hydroxylated hydrocarbons. Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical species oxidised substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism, where the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non&#8208;innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.

Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin-&#960;-cation radical species oxidised substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism, where the porphyrin-&#960;-cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;-cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non-innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Solid&#8208;State NMR with Structural and Biophysical Techniques to Design Challenging Protein&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecule that results from the conjugation of the cytotoxic Paclitaxel and Tafamidis, and maintains a high affinity for human transthyretin, demonstrates the potential contribution of solid&#8208;state NMR to the structure&#8208;based design of novel protein&#8208;drug conjugates.







Abstract
Several protein&#8208;drug conjugates are currently being used in cancer therapy. These conjugates rely on cytotoxic organic compounds that are covalently attached to the carrier proteins or that interact with them via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Human transthyretin (TTR), a physiological protein, has already been identified as a possible carrier protein for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs. Here we show the structure&#8208;guided development of a new stable cytotoxic molecule based on a known strong binder of TTR and a well&#8208;established anticancer drug. This example is used to demonstrate the importance of the integration of multiple biophysical and structural techniques, encompassing microscale thermophoresis, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. In particular, we show that solid&#8208;state NMR has the ability to reveal effects caused by ligand binding which are more easily relatable to structural and dynamical alterations that impact the stability of macromolecular complexes.

         <title>A General Organophotoredox Strategy to Difluoroalkyl Bicycloalkane (CF2&#8208;BCA) Hybrid Bioisosteres
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of difluoroalkyl bicycloalkane hybrid bioisostere (CF2&#8208;BCA) is reported. These molecules merge the structural and biological benefits of two well&#8208;established bioisosteres, profiling their utilization under drug discovery programs.







Abstract
Here, we report a general approach to the synthesis of the difluoroalkyl bicycloalkanes (CF2&#8208;BCAs), as structural surrogates of aryl ketones and ethers. The chemistry is driven by a dihydrobenzoacridine photocatalyst, that engages in a catalytic electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex, or directly reduces the fluorinated substrate. These two convergent manifolds lead to the generation of the R&#8208;CF2 radical, that reacts with the [1.1.1]&#8208; or [3.1.1.]&#8208;propellane. The method is extremely general, and extendable to complex bioactive molecules (30 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). The structural features of the CF2&#8208;BCP hybrid bioisostere were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray. Finally, we synthesised a CF2&#8208;BCP analogue of a Leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, replacing the original aryl ether motif. In silico docking studies indicated that this new analogue maintains the same arrangement within the enzyme pocket, profiling the use of the CF2&#8208;BCA hybrid bioisostere in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>Regulation of Redox Molecular Junctions in Covalent Organic Frameworks for H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalent organic frameworks with well&#8208;tuned redox molecular junctions have been prepared and can be successfully applied for H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with furfuryl alcohol photo&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass valorization can not only maximize the energy utilization but also realize the production of value&#8208;added products. Here, a series of COFs (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF and TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with regulated redox molecular junctions have been prepared to study H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with furfuryl alcohol (FFA) photo&#8208;oxidation to furoic acid (FA). The FA generation efficiency of Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF was found to be 575&#8197;mM&#8201;g&#8722;1 (conversion &#8776;100&#8201;% and selectivity &gt;99&#8201;%) and the H2O2 production rate can reach up to 187&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF, TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF and its monomers. As shown by theoretical calculations, the covalent coupling of the Cu cluster and the thiazole group can promote charge transfer, substrate activation and FFA dehydrogenation, thus boosting both the kinetics of H2O2 production and FFA photo&#8208;oxidation to increase the efficiency. This is the first report about COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass valorization, which might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline catalysts in this field.

         <title>Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylotrophic bacteria utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their metabolism: Studies with two bacterial lanthanide&#8208;using strains demonstrate that the trivalent radioactive 5&#8201;f elements americium and curium can support growth. Also, catalytic activity of the lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases with actinides is shown. For the first time it is established that actinides can play a beneficial role in biological metabolism.







Abstract
Certain f&#8208;block elements&#8212;the lanthanides&#8212;have biological relevance in the context of methylotrophic bacteria. The respective strains incorporate these 4&#8201;f elements into the active site of one of their key metabolic enzymes, a lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase. In this study, we investigated whether actinides, the radioactive 5&#8201;f elements, can replace the essential 4&#8201;f elements in lanthanide&#8208;dependent bacterial metabolism. Growth studies with Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV and the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 &#916;mxaF mutant demonstrate that americium and curium support growth in the absence of lanthanides. Moreover, strain SolV favors these actinides over late lanthanides when presented with a mixture of equal amounts of lanthanides together with americium and curium. Our combined in vivo and in vitro results establish that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their one&#8208;carbon metabolism if they possess the correct size and a +III oxidation state.

         <title>Molecular Exclusion Separation of 1&#8208;Butene Isomers by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With tailored pore environments, ultramicroporous MOF (MET&#8208;Fe) realized the molecular exclusion separation of 1&#8208;butene isomers. High&#8208;purity isobutene was obtained directly from a gas mixture, and large amounts of n&#8208;butene were collected in a mild regeneration process. Moreover, the high robustness endowed the adsorbent with excellent durability and unaffected separation performance in humidity.







Abstract
Separating n&#8208;butene and i&#8208;butene by adsorption is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but designing porous adsorbents that distinguish the subtle differences between the isomers is extremely challenging. Currently, adsorbents that can sieve 1&#8208;butene isomers and are stable enough to withstand humid gas mixtures are largely unmet. Herein, we propose a robust ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MET&#8208;Fe) that can separate 1&#8208;butene isomers through molecular exclusion. The pore aperture size (4.6&#8197;&#197;) precisely matches the kinetic diameters of the isomers, as verified by static and kinetic adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, easy regeneration, and remarkable reusability of MET&#8208;Fe in both dry and humid conditions. With its high selectivity, large breakthrough capacity, and outstanding stability, MET&#8208;Fe provides an ideal platform for industrial butene isomers separation.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenative Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination Using a Chiral Pyridine&#8208;Derived Half&#8208;Sandwich Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently challenging enantioselective direct reductive amination reaction under mild and operationally simple transfer hydrogenative conditions was developed using a rationally designed, chiral pyridine&#8208;derived half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalyst. The reaction was compatible with various functional groups and coordinative heterocycles.







Abstract
Chiral amines are broadly used compounds in pharmaceutical industry and organic synthesis, and reductive amination reactions have been the most appreciated methods for their syntheses. However, one&#8208;step transfer hydrogenative direct asymmetric reductive amination (THDARA) that could expand the scope, simplify the operation and eliminate the use of additives has been challenging. In this work, based on the Xiao's racemic transfer hydrogenative reductive amination in 2010 and our recent work in novel chiral pyridine ligands, chiral half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalysts were rationally designed and synthesized. Using the optimized catalyst and azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine as the hydrogen source, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;chiral (hetero)aryl amines, including various polar functional groups and heterocycles, were prepared in generally high yield and enantioselectivity under mild and operationally simple conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the catalytically active Ir&#8722;H species and the key hydride transfer step supported the chiral pyridine&#8208;induced stereospecific generation of the iridium center, and the enantioselection by taming the highly flexible key transition structure with multiple attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions. This work introduced a type of effective chiral catalysts for simplified approach to medicinally important chiral amines, as well as a rare example of robust enantioselective transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Chitin&#8208; and Streptavidin&#8208;Mediated Affinity Purification Systems: A Screening Platform for Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protein purification system, designated CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification), has been developed for enzyme library screening. The system utilizes chitin powder as a chromatography matrix to purify Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II fusion proteins. Given the cost of chitin and the availability of Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II, the CSAP system offers a powerful platform for the screening of purified proteins.







Abstract
Affinity purification of recombinant proteins is an essential technique in biotechnology. However, current affinity purification methods are very cost&#8208;intensive, and this imposes limits on versatile use of affinity purification for obtaining purified proteins for a variety of applications. To overcome this problem, we developed a new affinity purification system which we call CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification) for low&#8208;cost purification of Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II fusion proteins. The CSAP system is designed to utilize commercially available chitin powder as a chromatography matrix, thereby significantly improving the cost&#8208;efficiency of protein affinity purification. We investigated the CSAP system for protein screening in 96&#8208;well format as a demonstration. Through the screening of 96&#8197;types of purified hemoproteins, several proteins capable of the catalytic diastereodivergent synthesis of cyclopropanes were identified as candidates for an abiotic carbene transfer reaction.

         <title>Modeling the Enzyme Specificity by Molecular Cages through Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages with Zn&#8208;, Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;metal clusters exhibited different electronic structures which dictated the reactive oxygen species evolution. Three photoreactions were achieved by the three cages, respectively, because of the distinct charge transfer and energy transfer pathways. This work demonstrated a rare case that a supramolecular photocatalyst exhibited reaction specificity.







Abstract
Mimicking the active site and the substrate binding cavity of the enzyme to achieve specificity in catalytic reactions is an essential challenge. Herein, porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic cavities and tunable metal centers have proved the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating pathways as evidenced by multiple photo&#8208;induced oxidations. Remarkably, in the presence of the Zn4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center, PCC converted dioxygen molecules from triplet to singlet excitons, whereas the Ni4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center promoted the efficient dissociation of electrons and holes to conduct electron transfer towards substrates. Accordingly, the distinct ROS generation behavior of PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn and PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni enables the conversion of O2 to 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;, respectively. In contrast, the Co4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center combined the 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; together to generate carbonyl radicals, which in turn reacted with the oxygen molecules. Harnessing the three oxygen activation pathways, PCC&#8208;6&#8208;M (M=Zn/Ni/Co) display specific catalytic activities in thioanisole oxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn), benzylamine coupling (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni), and aldehyde autoxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Co). This work not only provides fundamental insights into the regulation of ROS generation by a supramolecular catalyst but also demonstrates a rare example of achieving reaction specificity through mimicking natural enzymes by PCCs.

         <title>High&#8208;entropy Electrolyte Enables High Reversibility and Long Lifespan for Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with the Mg2+&#8208;2DME&#8208;Otf&#8722;&#8208;Li+&#8208;DME&#8208;TMP solvation structure was built by introducing LiOTf and TMP to conventional Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolyte. The electrolyte successfully promoted the desolvation process and formed a Mg2+&#8208;conductive interfacial layer. In the presence of the high&#8208;entropy electrolyte, a Mg||Cu cell exhibited a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;%, and a Mg||Mo6S8 full cell delivered stable cycling performance.







Abstract
The stable cycling of Mg&#8208;metal anodes is limited by several problems, including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and passivation at the Mg surface. In this study, we present a high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of lithium triflate (LiOTf) and trimethyl phosphate (TMP) co&#8208;added to magnesium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2/1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of Mg&#8208;metal anodes. The as&#8208;formed high&#8208;entropy Mg2+&#8208;2DME&#8208;OTf&#8722;&#8208;Li+&#8208;DME&#8208;TMP solvation structure effectively reduced the Mg2+&#8208;DME interaction in comparison with that observed in traditional Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolytes, thereby preventing the formation of insulating components on the Mg&#8208;metal anode and promoting its electrochemical kinetics and cycling stability. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the high&#8208;entropy solvation structure brought OTf&#8722; and TMP to the surface of the Mg&#8208;metal anode and promoted the formation of a Mg3(PO4)2&#8208;rich interfacial layer, which is beneficial for enhancing Mg2+ conductivity. Consequently, the Mg&#8208;metal anode achieved excellent reversibility with a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;% and low voltage hysteresis. This study provides new insights into the design of electrolytes for Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

A facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis method at atmospheric pressure is employed to synthesize nanoparticles (NPs) with Pd&#8208;enriched high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) core and Pt&#8208;enriched HEA shell in a pure phase of face&#8208;centred cubic structure. The obtained PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs exhibit 2874 and 3386&#8197;mA&#8201;mg(Pd+Pt)&#8722;1 for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), respectively.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) have aroused great interest globally with their unique electrochemical, catalytic, and mechanical properties, as well as diverse activity and multielement tunability for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis method at atmospheric pressure is employed to synthesize Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell NPs with a single phase of face&#8208;centred cubic structure. Interestingly, the lattice of both Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell enlarge during the formation process of HEA, with tensile strains included in the core and shell of HEA. The as&#8208;obtained PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The specific (mass) activity of PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs for MOR is 4.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (2874&#8197;mA&#8201;mg(Pd+Pt)&#8722;1), about 1.7 (5.9) and 1.5 (4.8) times higher than that of commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Additional to high&#8208;entropy effect, Pt sites and Pd sites on the interface of the HEA act synergistically to facilitate the multi&#8208;step process towards EOR. This study offers a promising way to find a feasible route for scalable HEA manufacturing with promising applications.

         <title>A Chemical Proteomic Strategy Reveals Inhibitors of Lipoate Salvage in Bacteria and Parasites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct from humans, lipoic acid (LA) salvage by lipoate protein ligase (LPL) is an essential scavenging pathway for auxotrophic bacteria and parasites. Probes as LA&#8208;mimics were designed and shown to label LA&#8208;dependent proteins in living cells on lysines. This tool enabled us to perform competitive screens in order to identify two cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors with activity against P.&#8197;falciparum in erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of novel anti&#8208;infectives requires unprecedented strategies targeting pathways which are solely present in pathogens but absent in humans. Following this principle, we developed inhibitors of lipoic acid (LA) salvage, a crucial pathway for the survival of LA auxotrophic bacteria and parasites but non&#8208;essential in human cells. An LA&#8208;based probe was selectively transferred onto substrate proteins via lipoate protein ligase (LPL) in intact cells, and their binding sites were determined by mass spectrometry. Probe labeling served as a proxy of LPL activity, enabling in situ screenings for cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors. Profiling a focused compound library revealed two substrate analogs (LAMe and C3) as inhibitors, which were further validated by binding studies and co&#8208;crystallography. Importantly, LAMe exhibited low toxicity in human cells and achieved killing of Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes with an EC50 value of 15&#8197;&#956;M, making it the most effective LPL inhibitor reported to date.

         <title>CuCoO2 Nanoparticles as a Nanoprotease for Selective Proteolysis with High Efficiency at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoproteases usually contain tetravalent metal ions and function at high temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C). CuCoO2 nanoparticles selectively hydrolyze peptide bonds with hydrophobic residues at room temperature with very good reusability. The high Lewis acidity of Co3+ and the low valence of Cu+ are important for the high protease activity. The findings will aid the design of new efficient nanoproteases from low&#8208;valent metal oxide nanoparticles.







Abstract
Many nanoproteases contain tetravalent metal ions and catalyze peptide&#8208;bond hydrolysis only at high temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we report a new and effective strategy to explore nanoproteases from nanoparticles containing low valent metal ions. We found that flower&#8208;like CuCoO2 nanoparticles (CuCoO2 NPs) containing low valent Cu+ possessed excellent catalytic activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bonds with hydrophobic residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature. CuCoO2 NPs exhibited excellent stability and had great reusability. CuCoO2 NPs also hydrolyzed heat&#8208;denatured and surfactant&#8208;denatured BSA. Mechanism analysis revealed that the high Lewis acidity of Co3+ and the low valence of Cu+ were both essential for the high protease activity of CuCoO2 NPs. The flower&#8208;like structure of CuCoO2 NPs and the strong nucleophilicity of Cu+&#8208;bound hydroxyl endow them with excellent catalytic performance. The findings open a new way for the design and discovery of high&#8208;efficiency nanoproteases.

         <title>Construction of Asymmetrical Dual Jahn&#8211;Teller Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric dual Jahn&#8211;Teller site is assembled to match the CO2 and reductive intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and the intermediates for accurate modulation of photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) expresses great attraction to convert useless greenhouse gas into valuable chemical feedstock. However, the weak interactions between catalytic sites and PCR intermediates constrains the PCR activity and selectivity. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to match the intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and C1 intermediates by establishing dual Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) sites, in which, the strongly asymmetric J&#8211;T sites can break the nonpolar CO2 molecules and self&#8208;adapt the different structure of C1 intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric dual Jahn&#8211;Teller site is assembled to match the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reductive intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and the intermediates for accurate modulation of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity and selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (PCR) expresses great attraction to convert useless greenhouse gas into valuable chemical feedstock. However, the weak interactions between catalytic sites and PCR intermediates constrains the PCR activity and selectivity. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to match the intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates by establishing dual Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) sites, in which, the strongly asymmetric J&#8211;T sites can break the nonpolar CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and self-adapt the different structure of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates. Taking cobalt carbonate hydroxide as an example, the weakly symmetric dual cobalt (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dual J&#8211;T sites, weakly asymmetric Fe&amp;Co sites and strongly asymmetric Cu&amp;Co sites were assembled. After illumination, the interaction between dual J&#8211;T sites and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules enhances J&#8211;T distortion, which further modulates the PCR activity and selectivity. As a result, the Cu&amp;Co sites exhibited CO yield of 8137.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, about 2.3-fold and 4.2-fold higher than that of the Fe&amp;Co and Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites within 5-hour photoreaction, respectively. In addition, the selectivity achieved as high as 92.62&#8201;% than Fe&amp;Co (88.67&#8201;%) and Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites (55.33&#8201;%).

         <title>Dinitrogen Functionalization with Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Disulfide Giving Symmetric and Unsymmetric Hydrazido Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide reacted with an end&#8208;on bridging dinitrogen titanium/potassium complex though insertion into the Ti&#8722;NN bonds to form new nitrogen&#8208;carbon bonds. Carboxylation with CO2 afforded a symmetric dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. On the other hand, stepwise C&#8722;N bond formation proceeded at coordinated N2 to generated an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating with CS2 and then CO2.







Abstract
Here we show that a tridentate bis(aryloxide)anilide&#8208;ligated titanium/potassium scaffold promotes functionalization of coordinated N2 with CO2 and CS2 through formation of N&#8722;C bonds. Treatment of a naphthalene complex with N2 gave an end&#8208;on bridging dinitrogen complex featuring a [Ti2K2N2] core. The dinitrogen complex underwent insertion of CO2 into each Ti&#8722;NN bond to afford an N,N&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. Stepwise nitrogen&#8208;carbon bond formation at coordinated N2 proceeded to afford an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating the dinitrogen complex with CS2 and CO2. Addition of Me3SiCl to the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex resulted in partial silylation of the carboxylate groups but did not lead to removal of the functionalized N2 unit from the metal centers. However, reduction of the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex with potassium naphthalenide afforded an oxo&#8208;bridged dinuclear complex along with release of free potassium cyanate.

         <title>Deuterated TEKPol Biradicals and the Spin&#8208;Diffusion Barrier in MAS DNP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic nuclear polarization NMR of a series of deuterated and fluorinated TEKPol biradicals allows the elucidation of the hyperpolarization transfer pathway. This knowledge has enabled the design of a new polarization agent, NaphPol, which is the most efficient biradical in organic solvents to date.







Abstract
The sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy is considerably enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In DNP polarization is transferred from unpaired electrons of a polarizing agent to nearby proton spins. In solids, this transfer is followed by the transport of hyperpolarization to the bulk via 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion. The efficiency of these steps is critical to obtain high sensitivity gains, but the pathways for polarization transfer in the region near the unpaired electron spins are unclear. Here we report a series of seven deuterated and one fluorinated TEKPol biradicals to probe the effect of deprotonation on MAS DNP at 9.4&#8197;T. The experimental results are interpreted with numerical simulations, and our findings support that strong hyperfine couplings to nearby protons determine high transfer rates across the spin diffusion barrier to achieve short build&#8208;up times and high enhancements. Specifically, 1H DNP build&#8208;up times increase substantially with TEKPol isotopologues that have fewer hydrogen atoms in the phenyl rings, suggesting that these protons play a crucial role transferring the polarization to the bulk. Based on this new understanding, we have designed a new biradical, NaphPol, which yields significantly increased NMR sensitivity, making it the best performing DNP polarizing agent in organic solvents to date.

         <title>Rechargeable Biomass Battery for Electricity Storage/generation and Concurrent Valuable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable biomass battery was designed to integrate electricity storage/generation and electrosynthesis of useful chemicals from furfural in one system. By electrocatalyst (Rh1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy) and cathode redox pair (Co0.2Ni0.8(OH)2) design, the battery produces furfuryl alcohol in charging process and produces furoic acid in discharging process, reaching a high open circuit voltage of 1.29&#8197;V and power density of 107&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The development of a rechargeable battery that can produce valuable chemicals in both electricity storage and generation processes holds great promise for increasing the electron economy and economic value. However, this battery has yet to be explored. Herein, we report a biomass flow battery that generates electricity while producing furoic acid, and store electricity while yielding furfuryl alcohol. The battery is composed of a rhodium&#8208;copper (Rh1Cu) single&#8208;atom alloy as anode, a cobalt&#8208;doped nickel hydroxide (Co0.2Ni0.8(OH)2) as cathode, and furfural&#8208;containing anolyte. In a full battery evaluation, this battery displays an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.29&#8197;V and a peak power density up to 107&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most catalysis&#8208;battery hybrid systems. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that this battery produces 1&#8197;kg furoic acid with 0.78&#8197;kWh electricity output, and yields 0.62&#8197;kg furfuryl alcohol when 1&#8197;kWh electricity is stored. This work may shed light on the design of rechargeable batteries with value&#8208;added functionality such as chemicals production.

         <title>Enabling the Operation of Highly Compatible LiI&#8208;3&#8208;Hydroxypropionitrile Small&#8208;Molecule Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes in Lithium Metal Batteries via Stepped&#8208;Amorphization Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A stepped&#8208;amorphization strategy involving progressive composition, time, and temperature regulations is proposed to break the Li+ conduction bottleneck of the LiI&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropionitrile (LiI&#8208;HPN) hybrid system, to construct a small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with Li+ conductor&#8208;type and improved conductivity, which is successfully operated in lithium metal batteries to deliver considerable compatibility and stability.







Abstract
Integrating the advantages of both inorganic ceramic and organic polymer solid&#8208;state electrolytes, small&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state electrolytes represented by LiI&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropionitrile (LiI&#8208;HPN) inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems possess good interfacial compatibility and high modulus.

&lt;p&gt;A stepped-amorphization strategy involving progressive composition, time, and temperature regulations is proposed to break the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction bottleneck of the LiI-3-hydroxypropionitrile (LiI-HPN) hybrid system, to construct a small-molecule-based composite solid-state electrolyte with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductor-type and improved conductivity, which is successfully operated in lithium metal batteries to deliver considerable compatibility and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the advantages of both inorganic ceramic and organic polymer solid-state electrolytes, small-molecule solid-state electrolytes represented by LiI-3-hydroxypropionitrile (LiI-HPN) inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems possess good interfacial compatibility and high modulus. However, their lack of intrinsic Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction ability hinders potential application in lithium metal batteries until now, despite containing LiI phase composition. Herein, inspired by evolution tendency of ionic conduction behaviors together with first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a stepped-amorphization strategy to break the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction bottleneck of LiI-HPN. It involves three progressive steps of composition (LiI-content increasing), time (long-time standing), and temperature (high-temperature melting) regulations, to essentially construct a small-molecule-based composite solid-state electrolyte with intensified amorphous degree, which realizes efficient conversion from an I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductor and improved conductivity. As a proof, the stepped-optimized LiI-HPN is successfully operated in lithium metal batteries cooperated with Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; cathode to deliver considerable compatibility and stability over 250&#8197;cycles. This work not only clarifies the ionic conduction mechanisms of LiI-HPN inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems, but also provides a reasonable strategy to broaden the application scenarios of highly compatible small-molecule solid-state electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles with Chlorodiazirines: Synthetic Methodology and Thermal Hazard Assessment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that pyridinium and quinolinium salts can be accessed by the insertion of a single C&#8208;atom from an arylchlorodiazirine into the parent N&#8208;alkyl pyrrole or indole. The azinium products of ring expansion are activated towards oxygenation and hydrogenation, expediting further structural diversification. Safer methods for the use of diazirines as carbene precursors have been developed with insight from differential scanning calorimetry.







Abstract
We demonstrate that arylchlorodiazirines serve as photo&#8208;activated halocarbene precursors for the selective one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of N&#8208;substituted pyrroles and indoles to the corresponding pyridinium and quinolinium salts. Preliminary investigations indicate that the same strategy also enables the conversion of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles to pyrimidinium salts. The N&#8208;substituent of the substrate plays an essential role in: (1) increasing substrate scope by preventing product degradation, (2) enhancing yields by suppressing co&#8208;product inhibition, and (3) activating the azinium products towards subsequent synthetic manipulations. This latter point is illustrated by subjecting the quinolinium salts to four complementary partial reductions, which provide concise access to ring&#8208;expanded products with different degrees of increased C(sp3) character. Thermal analysis of the diazirines by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides detailed insight into their energetic properties, and highlights the safety benefits of photolyzing&#8212;rather than thermolyzing&#8212;these reagents.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>

         <dc:description>
The photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts, enabled by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer complex, has been developed. This strategy allows access to various carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceuticals via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals in the absence of a transition metal (TM) and photocatalyst (PC).







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods involving boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those for carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals by photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids by radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are generated by single&#8208;electron transfer of the photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>

An organic small&#8208;molecule octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate (OF&#8208;HDDA) is introduced to in situ crosslink forming a polymer (POF&#8208;HDDA), which anchors uncoordinated lead ions and prevents lead leakage from water and oxygen invasion, and concurrently improves the long&#8208;term stability of the corresponding devices.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the &#8722;CF2&#8722; hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer&#8208;incorporated devices are 24.76&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 20.66&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). More importantly, the storage stability, thermal stability, and operational stability have been significantly improved.

         <title>An Extracellular miRNA&#8208;Responsive Artificial Receptor via Dynamic DNA Nano&#8208;assembly for Biomarker&#8208;Driven Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) as a biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic nanodevice for liver injury repair has been developed. The miRNA&#8208;CDR is highly modular, programmable, and versatile, allowing us to customize sense&#8208;and&#8208;respond programs to diverse user&#8208;defined miRNA inputs with a tunable dynamic range, eliciting orthogonal activation of different receptor tyrosine kinases as signaling outputs, which is ultimately used for miRNA biomarker&#8208;driven acute liver injury repair.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various diseases. However, there is currently a lack of molecular strategies that can effectively use disease&#8208;associated extracellular miRNAs as input signals to drive therapeutic functions. Herein, we present a modular and programmable miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) capable of biomarker&#8208;driven therapy. By grafting a miRNA&#8208;responsive DNA nanodevice on a natural membrane receptor via aptamer anchoring, miRNA&#8208;CDR can sense extracellular miRNA levels and autonomously induce dimerization&#8208;mediated receptor activation via the complementary&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction&#8208;induced dynamic DNA assembly. The sequence programmability of miRNA&#8208;CDR allows it to sense and respond to a user&#8208;defined miRNA with tunable sensitivity. Moreover, the miRNA&#8208;CDR is versatile and customizable to reprogram desirable signaling output via adapting a designated receptor, such as MET and FGFR1. Using a mouse model of drug&#8208;induced acute liver injury (DILI), we demonstrate the functionality of a designer miRNA&#8208;CDR in rewiring the recognition of the DILI&#8208;elevated miR&#8208;122 to promote MET signaling of hepatocytes for biomarker&#8208;driven in situ repair and liver function restoration. Our synthetic miRNA&#8208;CDR platform provides a novel molecular device enabling biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic cellular response, potentially paving the way for improving the precision of cell therapy in regenerative medicine.

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Cyclopropyl to &#960;&#8208;Allyl Rearrangement at AuIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P,C)/(N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated as well as (P,N)&#8208;chelated AuIII &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes readily undergo ring&#8208;opening to give the corresponding &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes by cleavage of the distal &#963;(C&#8722;C) bond. The possible existence of &#963;(C&#8722;C) agostic interactions at AuIII is supported computationally.







Abstract
The possibility for AuIII &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes to undergo ring&#8208;opening and give &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes was interrogated. The transformation was first evidenced within (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, it occurs within hours at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. It was then generalized to other ancillary ligands. With (N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, the rearrangement occurs at room temperature while it proceeds already at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C with a dicationic (P,N)&#8208;chelated complex. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the mechanism of the transformation, a disrotatory electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening. Intrinsic Bond Orbital (IBO) analysis along the reaction profile shows the cleavage of the distal &#963;(CC) bond to give a &#960;&#8208;bonded allyl moiety. Careful inspection of the structure and bonding of cationic &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes support the possible existence of C&#8722;C agostic interactions at AuIII.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Amine Cascade Addition to Diyne&#8208;Ene: Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion utilizing gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular amine cascade addition to diyne&#8208;ene is reported herein, exhibiting good yield and excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
With the well&#8208;documented chemical and biological applications, piperidine and pyridine are among the most important N&#8208;heterocycles, and a new synthetic strategy, especially one with an alternative bond&#8208;forming design, is of general interest. Using the gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular condensation of amine and diyne&#8208;ene, we report herein the first example of enantioselective 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion (up to 95&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;e.e.).

         <title>Living Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Hetero Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts to Give Multifactor&#8208;Controlled and Fast&#8208;Photodegradable Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a hetero Diels&#8211;Alder adduct is reported. Vinyl polymers are produced with control of multiple structural parameters, including alternating sequence and head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity. The photodegradability of the obtained polymers has been thoroughly investigated for the first time.







Abstract
Precise control of multiple structural parameters associated with vinyl polymers is important for producing materials with the desired properties and functions. While the development of living polymerization methods has provided a way to control the various structural parameters of vinyl polymers, the concomitant control of their sequence and regioregularity remains a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, herein, we report the living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of hetero Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The scalable and modular synthesis of the cyclic monomers was achieved by a one&#8208;step protocol using readily available vinyl precursors. Subsequently, living polymerization of the cyclic monomers was examined, allowing the synthesis of vinyl polymers while controlling multiple factors, including molecular weight, dispersity, alternating sequence, head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity, and end&#8208;group functionality. The living characteristics of the developed method were further demonstrated by block copolymerization. The synthesized vinyl polymers exhibited unique thermal properties and underwent fast photodegradation even under sunlight.

A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described. This protocol proceeds via a migratory insertion of nickel hydride to alkyne followed by a CF2H&#8208;coupling, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and exclusive regioselectivity. The mild condition applies to a wide array of aliphatic and aryl alkynes with good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies are presented to support the proposed pathway.

         <title>A Multifunctional Liquid Crystal as Hole Transport Layer Additive Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a multifunctional liquid crystal (LQ) into (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#8208;based hole transport layer (HTL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can strongly enhance hot carriers extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, reducing charge&#8208;carrier recombination in device. Moreover, LQ can efficiently prevent the Li ions migration and agglomeration of Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) HTL dopant through chemical interaction. Using this approach, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) has been identified as the most used and effective p&#8208;dopant for hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI in HTL negatively impact PSCs performance and stability. Herein, we report an effective strategy for adding a liquid crystal organic small molecule (LQ) into Li&#8208;TFSI doped (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208; spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) HTL. It was found that the introduction of LQ into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTL can efficiently enhance the charge carrier extraction and transportation in device, which can strongly retard the charge carrier recombination in device. Consequently, the PSCs efficiency is significantly enhanced to 24.42&#8201;% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD+LQ) from 21.03&#8201;% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD). The chemical coordination between LQ and Li&#8208;TFSI can strongly confine Li+ ions migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI, thus, achieving the enhanced device stability. Only a 9&#8201;% efficiency degradation is observed for un&#8208;encapsulated device prepared with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and LQ after 1700&#8197;h under air environment, while the efficiency drops by 30&#8201;% for the reference device. This work provides an effective strategy for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs, and gives some important insights for understanding intrinsic hot carriers dynamics for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of a multifunctional liquid crystal (LQ) into (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9&#8242;-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)-based hole transport layer (HTL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can strongly enhance hot carriers extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, reducing charge-carrier recombination in device. Moreover, LQ can efficiently prevent the Li ions migration and agglomeration of Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) HTL dopant through chemical interaction. Using this approach, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) has been identified as the most used and effective p-dopant for hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the migration and agglomeration of Li-TFSI in HTL negatively impact PSCs performance and stability. Herein, we report an effective strategy for adding a liquid crystal organic small molecule (LQ) into Li-TFSI doped (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;-tetrakis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9&#8242;- spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) HTL. It was found that the introduction of LQ into Spiro-OMeTAD HTL can efficiently enhance the charge carrier extraction and transportation in device, which can strongly retard the charge carrier recombination in device. Consequently, the PSCs efficiency is significantly enhanced to 24.42&#8201;% (Spiro-OMeTAD+LQ) from 21.03&#8201;% (Spiro-OMeTAD). The chemical coordination between LQ and Li-TFSI can strongly confine Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions migration and agglomeration of Li-TFSI, thus, achieving the enhanced device stability. Only a 9&#8201;% efficiency degradation is observed for un-encapsulated device prepared with Spiro-OMeTAD and LQ after 1700&#8197;h under air environment, while the efficiency drops by 30&#8201;% for the reference device. This work provides an effective strategy for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs, and gives some important insights for understanding intrinsic hot carriers dynamics for perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;Amino Allenoates Bearing a Vicinal All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenter with Dual&#8208;Copper&#8208;Catalysis</title>

The asymmetric &#947;&#8208;additions of 1&#8208;alkynyl ketimines under dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalysis have been developed, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino allenoates with a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee, up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were catalyzed by double chiral Cu catalysts.







Abstract
The skeletons of chiral tetrasubstituted allenes bearing a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter are of importance but still challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective &#947;&#8208;additions of 1&#8208;alkynyl ketimines with dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalysis under mild conditions, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino allenoates bearing a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Importantly, the stereodivergent synthesis of the products was realized by the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reaction and the Grignard reagent promoted epimerization. Moreover, the dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were smoothly applied to a gram&#8208;scale reaction and adopted to introduce chiral tetrasubstituted allenyl moieties into bioactive molecules. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were catalyzed by double chiral copper catalysts.

         <title>Platinum Metallacycle&#8208;Based Molecular Recognition: Establishment and Application in Spontaneous Formation of a [2]Rotaxane with Light&#8208;Harvesting Property</title>

We report a platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system and its application in efficient construction of a [2]rotaxane with sequential light&#8208;harvesting property.







Abstract
Macrocyclic molecule&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems, which provide contributions for the design and construction of functional supramolecular structures, have gained increasing attention in recent years. In particular, platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems provide opportunities for chemical scientists to prepare novel materials with various functions and structures due to the well&#8208;defined shapes and cavity sizes of platinum(II) metallacycles. However, the research on platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems has been given little attention. In this article, we demonstrate the host&#8211;guest complexation between a platinum(II) metallacycle and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule, naphthalene. Taking advantage of metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest interactions and the dynamic property of reversible Pt coordination bonds, a [2]rotaxane is efficiently prepared by employing a template&#8208;directed clipping procedure. The [2]rotaxane is further applied to the fabrication of an efficient light&#8208;harvesting system with multi&#8208;step energy transfer process. This work comprises an important supplement to macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems and demonstrates a strategy for efficient production of well&#8208;defined mechanically interlocked molecules with practical values.

         <title>Going Beyond Silver in Ethylene Epoxidation with First&#8208;Principles Catalyst Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using computational screening of the periodic table for ethylene epoxidation catalysts, Ag/CuPb, Ag/CuCd, and Ag/CuTl were identified as superior catalysts. The inclusion of surface oxidation, side reactions and epoxide decomposition is shown to be paramount to avoid erroneous predictions. The predicted catalysts were synthesised, characterised and tested, confirming the predictions.







Abstract
Ethylene epoxidation is industrially and commercially one of the most important selective oxidations. Silver catalysts have been state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for decades, their efficiency steadily improving with empirical discoveries of dopants and co&#8208;catalysts. Herein, we perform a computational screening of the metals in the periodic table, identify prospective superior catalysts and experimentally demonstrate that Ag/CuPb, Ag/CuCd and Ag/CuTl outperform the pure&#8208;Ag catalysts, while they still confer an easily scalable synthesis protocol. Furthermore, we show that to harness the potential of computationally&#8208;led discovery of catalysts fully, it is essential to include the relevant in situ conditions e.g., surface oxidation, parasitic side reactions and ethylene epoxide decomposition, as neglecting such effects leads to erroneous predictions. We combine ab initio calculations, scaling relations, and rigorous reactor microkinetic modelling, which goes beyond conventional simplified steady&#8208;state or rate&#8208;determining modelling on immutable catalyst surfaces. The modelling insights have enabled us to both synthesise novel catalysts and theoretically understand experimental findings, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principles simulations and industrial applications. We show that the computational catalyst design can be easily extended to include larger reaction networks and other effects, such as surface oxidations. The feasibility was confirmed by experimental agreement.

         <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Superoxide&#8208;Triggered Nanoreporters for Crosstalk&#8208;Free Dual Fluorescence/Chemiluminescence Imaging and Urinalysis in Living Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters with superoxide anion&#8208;triggered luminescent turn&#8208;on response and nanostructure decomposition are synthesized. The conversion from nanoparticles to renal clearable fragments allows for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging of peritonitis, drug induced hepatoxicity and in vitro urinalysis.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging has been recognized as a valuable tool for ultrasensitive detection of physio&#8208;pathological events through elimination of background autofluorescence. However, most chemiluminescent nanoprobes suffer from shallow imaging depths and slow clearance from living bodies, which impede their use in clinical settings. We herein report size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters (ADN1 and ADN2) that could be activated at disease site by superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) to trigger nanostructure disassembly into renal excretable fluorescent fragments as well as chemiluminescence turn&#8208;on for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinalysis. In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated O2&#8901;&#8722; to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620&#8197;nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19&#8197;h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red&#8208;shifted chemiluminescence at &#8776;800&#8197;nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.

In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620&#8197;nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19&#8197;h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near-infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red-shifted chemiluminescence at &#8776;800&#8197;nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug-induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte with a wide liquidus range is proposed for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Its all&#8208;anion Li+ solvation and phase&#8208;nano&#8208;segregation solution structure are sustained at low temperatures, which, together with a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic compounds on lithium metal anodes, enable stable cycling of LMBs with high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries but suffers from low stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency and dendritic growth particularly at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, a poorly&#8208;flammable, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte with a wide liquidus range extending well below 0&#8201;&#176;C is proposed for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries. Its all&#8208;anion Li+ solvation and phase&#8208;nano&#8208;segregation solution structure are sustained at low temperatures, which, together with a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic compounds, enable dendrite&#8208;free operation of lithium metal anodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.9&#8201;%. As a result, lithium metal batteries coupling thin lithium metal anodes (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathodes (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) retain 70&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These results, as a proof of concept, demonstrate the applicability of locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Metallaphotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Using Alcohols as Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective coupling of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and aryl bromides, using Ni/photoredox catalysis and alcohols as reducing agents, is reported. This protocol offers modular access to enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant precursors, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. The alcohol&#8208;based approach holds potential as a general platform for enantioselective cross&#8208;electrophile couplings.







Abstract
The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) represents a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation. However, controlling the enantioselectivity in these processes remains a challenge. Here, we report an unprecedented enantioselective XEC of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with aryl bromides, enabled by alcohols as reducing agents via Ni/photoredox catalysis. This mechanistically distinct approach exploits the ability of photocatalytically generated &#945;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals to convert alkyl electrophiles to the corresponding alkyl radicals that are then enantioselectively coupled with aryl bromides. The readily scalable protocol allows modular access to valuable enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant and inexpensive precursors, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies rationalize the versatility of this alcohol&#8208;based reactivity for radical generation and subsequent asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. We expect that this alcohol&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling will render a general platform for the development of appealing yet challenging enantioselective XECs.

         <title>Cesium Methylammonium Lead Iodide (CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3) Nanocrystals with Wide Range Cation Composition Tuning and Enhanced Thermal Stability of the Perovskite Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite phase&#8208;pure mixed&#8208;cation CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals were obtained by post&#8208;synthesis cation exchange between CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals at room temperature. The CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals exhibit composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL) with their thermal stability that is enhanced compared to the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals.







Abstract
Cesium methylammonium lead iodide (CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3) nanocrystals were obtained with a wide range of A&#8208;site Cs&#8208;MA compositions by post&#8208;synthetic, room temperature cation exchange between CsPbI3 nanocrystals and MAPbI3 nanocrystals. The alloyed CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals retain their photoactive perovskite phase with incorporated Cs content, x, as high as 0.74 and the expected composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL). Excess methylammonium oleate from the reaction mixture in the MAPbI3 nanocrystal dispersions was necessary to obtain fast Cs&#8208;MA cation exchange. The phase transformation and degradation kinetics of films of CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals were measured and modeled using an Avrami expression. The transformation kinetics were significantly slower than those of the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals, with Avrami rate constants, k, at least an order of magnitude smaller. These results affirm that A&#8208;site cation alloying is a promising strategy for stabilizing iodide&#8208;based perovskites.

         <title>Organopotassium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions is described. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silicon source, various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes were prepared from methylarenes precursors. Mechanistic studies demonstrate the involvement of organopotassium reagents, including synthetically&#8208;elusive tert&#8208;butylpotassium.







Abstract
Benzylsilanes have found increasing applications in organic synthesis as bench&#8208;stable synthetic intermediates, yet are mostly produced by stoichiometric procedures. Catalytic alternatives based on the atom&#8208;economical silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds remain scarcely available as specialized directing groups and catalytic systems are needed to outcompete the kinetically&#8208;favored silylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we describe the first general and catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silicon source. The high activity and selectivity of the catalytic system, exemplified by the preparation of various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes, originates from the facile generation of organopotassium reagents, including tert&#8208;butylpotassium.

&lt;p&gt;The first catalytic-in-metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal-free conditions is described. Using stable &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-substituted silyldiazenes (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as silicon source, various mono- or &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-bis benzyl(di)silanes were prepared from methylarenes precursors. Mechanistic studies demonstrate the involvement of organopotassium reagents, including synthetically-elusive &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylpotassium.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzylsilanes have found increasing applications in organic synthesis as bench-stable synthetic intermediates, yet are mostly produced by stoichiometric procedures. Catalytic alternatives based on the atom-economical silylation of benzylic C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds remain scarcely available as specialized directing groups and catalytic systems are needed to outcompete the kinetically-favored silylation of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we describe the first general and catalytic-in-metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal-free conditions using stable &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-substituted silyldiazenes (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as silicon source. The high activity and selectivity of the catalytic system, exemplified by the preparation of various mono- or &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-bis benzyl(di)silanes, originates from the facile generation of organopotassium reagents, including &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylpotassium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Capacity Degradation of Ge Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Triggered by Interfacial LiH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ge anode failure mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is analyzed. There is a clear correlation between Ge electrode failure and the interfacial evolution of LiH. It is revealed that Li4Ge2H, as a new species derived from LiH, is the culprit of Ge anode degradation.







Abstract
The Germanium (Ge), as a fast&#8208;charging and high specific capacity (1568&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) alloy anode, is greatly hampered in practical application by poor cyclability. To date, the understanding of cycling performance degradation remains elusive. This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li4Ge2H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever&#8208;growing and ever&#8208;insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li4Ge2H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Remote Borylation of Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric remote borylation of alkyl bromides is reported. The application of this migratory borylation was extended to other alkyl electrophiles (alkyl&#8208;X with X=I, Cl, OTs) and aryl halides. Additionally, a gram&#8208;scale reaction could be conducted while further transformation of the borylated products was demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated a radical reaction pathway may be involved.







Abstract
Enantioselective functionalization of racemic alkyl halides is an efficient strategy to assemble complex chiral molecules, but remains one of the biggest challenges in organic chemistry. The distant and selective activation of unreactive C&#8722;H bonds in alkyl halides has received growing interest as it enables rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple building blocks. Here, we reported a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed remote borylation of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8722;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OTs) with pinacolborane (HBpin) and presented a robust approach for the generation of valuable chiral secondary organoboronates from racemic alkyl halides. This migration borylation reaction is compatible with primary, secondary, and tertiary bromides, offering direct access to a broad range of alkylboronates. The extension of this catalytic system to the borylation of aryl halides was also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that this remote borylation involved a radical reaction pathway.

One&#8208;handed helical poly(biarylylacetylene)s (PBAs) bearing axially&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;arylpyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide units with different substituents were synthesized. The propoxy&#8208;bound helical PBA shows an excellent chiral recognition as a chiral stationary phase (CSP) in liquid chromatography and resolves various chiral aromatic/aliphatic alcohols.

Abstract
A series of poly(biarylylacetylene)s (PBAs) bearing axially&#8208;chiral (S)&#8208;and (R)&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide residues with a methoxy, propoxy, or acetyloxy substituent at the 3&#8208;position of the biaryl units was synthesized. All the PBAs formed a preferred&#8208;handed helix, while the helical sense preference was varied depending on the substituents despite the same twist&#8208;sense of the biaryl units. Among them, the propoxy&#8208;bound helical PBA showed an exceptionally high chiral recognition ability as a chiral stationary phase (CSP) for high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and efficiently resolved not only various chiral aromatic alcohols, but also a variety of chiral aliphatic alcohols; the latter still remains difficult to resolve by commercially&#8208;available CSPs in HPLC. Such practically&#8208;useful both handed helical PBA&#8208;based CSPs can be produced from the racemic PBA composed of fully racemic monomer units through deracemization of the biaryl units with a chiral alcohol.

The first bioinspired total synthesis of 1 has been accomplished through a sequential Reformatsky/oxidation/regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydrogenation, subsequent merged MBH&#8211;Tsuji&#8211;Trost cyclization, and an intramolecular Michael addition.

Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Adenophorone (1), a caged polycyclic sesquiterpene featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[4.3.1.05,9]decane skeleton, was isolated from Eupatorium adenopharum Spreng. The structure of 1 was unambiguously established by a combination of spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and bioinspired total synthesis. Key synthetic features include a sequential Reformatsky/oxidation/regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydrogenation, and subsequent merged MBH&#8211;Tsuji&#8211;Trost cyclization. The concise synthetic sequence efficiently constructs the bicyclic skeleton of cadinene sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;euptox&#8197;A (2) in 8 steps from commercially available monoterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;carvone (6), with outstanding performance on diastereocontrol. The bioinspired synthesis of 1 was achieved from 2, a plausible biogenetic precursor, via transannular Michael addition. This work provides experimental evidence of our proposed biosynthetic hypothesis of 1. Additionally, compound 1 showed potent neuroprotective activity in H2O2&#8208;treated SH&#8208;SY5Y and PC12 cells.

         <title>Facile Processing of Unsubstituted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Aromatic Polymers through Water&#8208;solubilization Using Aromatic Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic micelles enable the solubilization of virtually insoluble, unsubstituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) in water through non&#8208;covalent encircling. The &#960;CAPs are solubilized as fine bundles within the micelles and can be facilely analyzed by UV/Visible, emission, AFM, and/or SEM analyses. The obtained aqueous solutions are processable into free&#8208;standing &#960;CAP thin films using a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) are central components of functional materials yet suffer from insolubility without multiple covalent substituents on their backbones. We herein disclose a new strategy for the facile processing of unsubstituted heterocyclic &#960;CAPs (i.e., poly(para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;benzobisoxazole) and poly(benzimidazobenzo&#8208;phenanthroline)), independent of the polymer length, via non&#8208;covalent encircling with aromatic micelles, composed of bent aromatic amphiphiles, in water. The UV/Visible studies reveal that the efficiencies of the present encircling method are &#8776;10 to 50&#8208;fold higher than those using conventional amphiphiles under the same conditions. The AFM and SEM analyses of the resultant aqueous polymer composites show that otherwise insoluble &#960;CAPs form fine bundles (e.g., &#8776;1&#8197;nm in thickness) in the tubular aromatic micelles, through efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. In the same way, pristine poly(para&#8208;phenylene) can be dissolved in water, displaying enhanced fluorescence (10&#8208;fold), relative to the polymer solid. Two types of unsubstituted &#960;CAPs are likewise co&#8208;encircled in water, indicated by UV/Visible analysis. Importantly, aqueous processing of the encircled &#960;CAPs into free&#8208;standing single&#8208; or multicomponent films with submicrometer thickness is demonstrated through a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.

         <title>Transformation of Type III to Type II Porous Liquids by Tuning Surface Rigidity of Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating N&#8208;donor molecules on the Rh&#8722;Rh axial sites of insoluble RhMOP, and making it soluble as porous host in bulky ionic liquid, a type&#8197;III porous liquid was transformed into type&#8197;II porous liquids for better catalyzing the cycloaddition of CO2.







Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs), a summation of porous hosts and bulky solvents bestowing permanent cavities, are the prominent emerging materials. Despite great efforts, exploration of porous hosts and bulky solvents is still needed to develop new PL systems. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with discrete molecular architectures can be considered as porous hosts; however, many of them are insoluble entities. Here we report the transformation of type&#8197;III PL to type&#8197;II PLs by tuning the surface rigidity of insoluble MOP, Rh24L24, in a bulky ionic liquid (IL). Functionalization of N&#8208;donor molecules on Rh&#8722;Rh axial sites ensue their solubilization in bulky IL which confer type&#8197;II PLs. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal the bulkiness of IL as per the cage apertures, and the cause of their dissolution as well. The obtained PLs, capturing more CO2 than neat solvent, have depicted higher catalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition compared to individual MOPs and IL.

         <title>The First Enantiomeric Stereogenic Sulfur&#8208;Chiral Organic Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the discovery of the first ferroelectric chiral Rochelle salt more than 100&#8197;years ago, the first pair of stereogenic heteroatom sulfur&#8208;chiral ferroelectric crystals is reported on this study. The findings provide a perspective for the development of heteroatomic chiral ferroelectric crystals with great application prospects.







Abstract
Chiral ferroelectric crystals with intriguing features have attracted great interest and many with point or axial chirality based on the stereocarbon have been successively developed in recent years. However, ferroelectric crystals with stereogenic heteroatomic chirality have never been documented so far. Here, we discover and report a pair of enantiomeric stereogenic sulfur&#8208;chiral single&#8208;component organic ferroelectric crystals, Rs&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (Rs&#8208;tBuSA) and Ss&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (Ss&#8208;tBuSA) through the deep understanding of the chemical design of molecular ferroelectric crystals. Both enantiomers adopt chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 (C2) and exhibit mirror&#8208;image relationships. They undergo high&#8208;temperature 432F2&#8208;type plastic ferroelectric phase transition around 348&#8197;K. The ferroelectricity has been well confirmed by ferroelectric hysteresis loops and domains. Polarized light microscopy records the evolution of the ferroelastic domains, according with the fact that the 432F2&#8208;type phase transition is both ferroelectric and ferroelastic. The very soft characteristics with low elastic modulus and hardness reveals their excellent mechanical flexibility. This finding indicates the first stereosulfur chiral molecular ferroelectric crystals, opening up new fertile ground for exploring molecular ferroelectric crystals with great application prospects.

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Directed Proximity&#8208;Driven Crosslinking Method for Native Peptide Bicyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;directed proximity&#8208;driven crosslinking strategy that is initiated by rapid cysteine labeling followed by proximity&#8208;driven amine acylation enables the construction of peptide bicycles with various ring topologies with high efficiency. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the bicyclization of peptides fused to proteins as well to the M13 phage, paving the way to phage display of novel peptide bicycles.







Abstract
Efficient and site&#8208;specific modification of native peptides and proteins is desirable for synthesizing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates as well as for constructing chemically modified peptide libraries using genetically encoded platforms such as phage display. In particular, there is much interest in efficient multicyclization of native peptides due to the appeals of multicyclic peptides as therapeutics. However, conventional approaches for multicyclic peptide synthesis require orthogonal protecting groups or non&#8208;proteinogenic clickable handles. Herein, we report a cysteine&#8208;directed proximity&#8208;driven strategy for the constructing bicyclic peptides from simple natural peptide precursors. This linear to bicycle transformation initiates with rapid cysteine labeling, which then triggers proximity&#8208;driven amine&#8208;selective cyclization. This bicyclization proceeds rapidly under physiologic conditions, yielding bicyclic peptides with a Cys&#8208;Lys&#8208;Cys, Lys&#8208;Cys&#8208;Lys or N&#8208;terminus&#8208;Cys&#8208;Cys stapling pattern. We demonstrate the utility and power of this strategy by constructing bicyclic peptides fused to proteins as well as to the M13 phage, paving the way to phage display of novel bicyclic peptide libraries.

         <title>Surface Adsorbed Hydroxyl: A Double&#8208;Edged Sword in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction over Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR), surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) are demonstrated to act as a double&#8208;edged sword for selective C2 production. OHad with adsorption well optimized and steered would contribute to the stable C2 production with high selectivity over OD&#8722;Cu for long&#8208;term ECO2RR.







Abstract
Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles (NPs) created via surface structure reconstruction was developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR). With surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) identified during ECO2RR, it is realized that OHad, sterically confined and adsorbed at OD&#8722;Cu by surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm NPs, should be determinative to the multi&#8208;carbon (C2) product selectivity. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that OHad favors the adsorption of low&#8208;frequency *CO with weak C&#8801;O bonds and strengthens the *CO binding at OD&#8722;Cu surface, promoting *CO dimerization and then selective C2 production. However, excessive OHad would inhibit selective C2 production by occupying active sites and facilitating competitive H2 evolution. In a flow cell, stable C2 production with high selectivity of &#8764;60&#8201;% at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved over OD&#8722;Cu, with adsorption of OHad well steered in the fast flowing electrolyte.

         <title>Pure and Metal&#8208;confining Carbon Nanotubes through Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide in Ca&#8208;based Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in affordable Ca&#8208;based molten salt is demonstrated as an efficient preparation of carbon nanotube (CNT, above) and metal&#8208;confining CNT (M@CNT, below) by a CaC2&#8208;mediated mechanism.







Abstract
To be successfully implemented, an efficient conversion, affordable operation and high values of CO2&#8208;derived products by electrochemical conversion of CO2 are yet to be addressed. Inspired by the natural CaO&#8208;CaCO3 cycle, we herein introduce CaO into electrolysis of SnO2 in affordable molten CaCl2&#8208;NaCl to establish an in situ capture and conversion of CO2. In situ capture of anodic CO2 from graphite anode by the added CaO generates CaCO3. The consequent co&#8208;electrolysis of SnO2 and CaCO3 confines Sn in carbon nanotube (Sn@CNT) in cathode and increases current efficiency of O2 evolution in graphite anode to 71.9&#8201;%. The intermediated CaC2 is verified as the nuclei to direct a self&#8208;template generation of CNT, ensuring a CO2&#8208;CNT current efficiency and energy efficiency of 85.1&#8201;% and 44.8&#8201;%, respectively. The Sn@CNT integrates confined responses of Sn cores to external electrochemical or thermal stimuli with robust CNT sheaths, resulting in excellent Li storage performance and intriguing application as nanothermometer. The versatility of the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in Ca&#8208;based molten salts for template&#8208;free generation of advanced carbon materials is evidenced by the successful generation of pure CNT, Zn@CNT and Fe@CNT.

         <title>Dimeric Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkenylation of Alkynes with a Versatile Silicon&#8208;Based Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of silanol as a removable directing group allows for dimeric manganese&#8208;catalyzed selective hydroalkenylation of alkynes at ambient conditions under an open air atmosphere. The resulting stereodefined 1,3&#8208;diene silanol products are obtained in good regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity while also being versatile building blocks for rich downstream transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we present a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, branched&#8208;selective hydroalkenylation of terminal alkynes, under mild conditions through facile installation of a versatile silanol as a removable directing group. With an alkenyl boronic acid as the coupling partner, this reaction produces stereodefined (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with high regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The protocol features mild reaction conditions such as room temperature and an air atmosphere, while maintaining excellent functional group compatibility. The resulting 1,3&#8208;dienesilanol products serve as versatile building blocks, as the removal of the silanol group allows for the synthesis of both branched terminal 1,3&#8208;dienes for downstream coupling reactions, as well as stereoselective construction of linear (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and (E,E,E)&#8208; or (E,E,Z)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienes. In addition, a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition can smoothly and selectively deliver silicon&#8208;containing pentasubstituted cyclohexene derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, in conjunction with DFT calculations, suggest a bimetallic synergistic activation model to account for the observed enhanced catalytic efficiency and good regioselectivity.

         <title>Multiple Heteroatom&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Bridging Electron Transport in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Supramolecular System for Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway is revealed in a noncovalent&#8208;linked supramolecular photosystem, starting from readily available COF and metal&#8208;bipyridine complex. The hydrogen bonding supramolecular system exhibits enhanced electron transfer and performance for CO2 photoreduction. This work provides an avenue to rationally design easily accessible photosystems.







Abstract
Supramolecular systems consisting of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and Ni complex are designed for robust photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Multiple heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonding between the COF and Ni complex is identified to play a decisive role in the photoexcited electron transfer across the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The diminution of steric groups on COF or metal complex can optimize catalytic performance, which is more attributable to the enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction rather than their intrinsic activity. The photosystem with relatively strong strength of hydrogen bonds exhibits remarkable photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, far superior to photosystems with supported atomic Ni or metal complex alone in the absence of hydrogen&#8208;bond effect. Such heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway confers supramolecular system with high photocatalytic performance, providing an avenue to rationally design efficient and steadily available photosystems.

         <title>Alleviating Side Reactions on Zn Anodes for Aqueous Batteries by a Cell Membrane Derived Phosphorylcholine Zwitterionic Protective Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyzwitterionic protective layer with phosphate and choline groups was engineered to alleviate the side reactions on Zn anode. The choline group can adsorb on Zn anode to expel H2O and regulate the Zn deposition behavior, and the phosphate group can decrease the Zn2+ desolvation energy barrier and form transfer route for faster ion migration, thus rendering the Zn anode with excellent rate performance and stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries are attractive for next generation batteries with high safety, yet their applications are still hindered by the uncontrollable dendrite formation and side reactions on Zn anode. Here, a polyzwitterion protective layer (PZIL) was engineered by polymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) in carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), which renders the following merits: the choline groups of MPC can preferentially adsorb onto Zn metal to avoid side reactions; the charged phosphate groups chelate with Zn2+ to regulate the solvation structure, further improving side reaction inhibition; the Hofmeister effect between ZnSO4 and CMCS can enhance the interfacial contact during electrochemical characterization. Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with PZIL can keep stable for more than 1000&#8197;hours under the ultra&#8208;high current density of 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The PZIL confers the Zn/MnO2 full battery and Zn/active carbon (AC) capacitor with stable cycling performance under high current density.

&lt;p&gt;A polyzwitterionic protective layer with phosphate and choline groups was engineered to alleviate the side reactions on Zn anode. The choline group can adsorb on Zn anode to expel H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and regulate the Zn deposition behavior, and the phosphate group can decrease the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation energy barrier and form transfer route for faster ion migration, thus rendering the Zn anode with excellent rate performance and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual Photosensitizer Coupled Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method allows dual&#8208;photosensitizer&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (3D MCOF) photocatalysts to be built by covalently linking two types of traditional photosensitizers (such as pyridine ruthenium and metalloporphyrin complex). These MCOFs exhibit outstanding activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and the in situ produced hydrogen can be used in tandem for alkyne hydrogenation.







Abstract
In this work, we innovatively assembled two types of traditional photosensitizers, that is pyridine ruthenium/ferrum (Ru(bpy)32+/Fe(bpy)32+) and porphyrin/metalloporphyrin complex (2HPor/ZnPor) by covalent linkage to get a series of dual photosensitizer&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs), which behaved strong visible light&#8208;absorbing ability, efficient electron transfer and suitable band gap for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution. Rubpy&#8208;ZnPor COF achieved the highest H2 yield (30&#8201;338&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.68&#8201;%@420&#8197;nm, which showed one of the best performances among all reported COF based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the in situ produced H2 was successfully tandem used in the alkyne hydrogenation with &#8776;99.9&#8201;% conversion efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that both the two photosensitizer units in MCOFs can be photoexcited and thus contribute optimal photocatalytic activity. This work develops a general strategy and shows the great potential of using multiple photosensitive materials in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Harmonious Heterointerfaces Formed on 2D&#8208;Pt Nanodendrites by Facet&#8208;Respective Stepwise Metal Deposition for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Metal Nanohybrids with harmonious heterointerfaces have been synthesized by facet&#8208;respective stepwise metal deposition. These hybrid nanomaterial can approach superior electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance induced by unique multi heterointerfaces in specific facet for effective activation of platinum.







Abstract
The performance of nanocrystal (NC) catalysts could be maximized by introducing rationally designed heterointerfaces formed by the facet&#8208; and spatio&#8208;specific modification with other materials of desired size and thickness. However, such heterointerfaces are limited in scope and synthetically challenging. Herein, we applied a wet chemistry method to tunably deposit Pd and Ni on the available surfaces of porous 2D&#8722;Pt nanodendrites (NDs). Using 2D silica nanoreactors to house the 2D&#8208;PtND, an 0.5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (e&#8208;Pd or e&#8208;Ni) was exclusively formed on the flat {110} surface of 2D&#8722;Pt, while a non&#8208;epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (n&#8208;Pd or n&#8208;Ni) was typically deposited at the {111/100} edge in absence of nanoreactor. Notably, these differently located Pd/Pt and Ni/Pt heterointerfaces experienced distinct electronic effect to influence unequally in electrocatalytic synergy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For instance, an enhanced H2 generation on the Pt{110} facet with 2D&#8208;2D interfaced e&#8208;Pd deposition and faster water dissociation on the edge&#8208;located n&#8208;Ni overpowered their facet&#8208;located counterparts in respective HER catalysis. Therefore, a feasible assembling of the valuable heterointerfaces in the optimal 2D n&#8208;Ni/e&#8208;Pd/Pt catalyst overcame the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics, with a catalytic activity 7.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Influence of Molecular Separation on Through&#8208;Space Intervalence Transient Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Cofacially arranged Redox Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extent of electronic coupling and through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer in photo&#8208;conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks is unveiled through dynamic studies, charge transfer integral and charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;mobility measurement. Their influence on molecular separation is also revealed.







Abstract
We demonstrate direct evidence of photoinduced through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) between two cofacially arranged redox&#8208;active pairs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their dynamic variation with their molecular separation. Two homologous MOFs [Co2(NDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DPTTZ. DMF, 1 and [Co2(BDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DMF, 2 (where NDC=naphthalene dicarboxylate, BDC=benzene dicarboxylate, DPTTZ=N, N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiazolo&#8208;[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, DMF=N, N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl formamide) are considered for this, whose intra&#8208;dimer distance of redox&#8208;active DPTTZ ligands differs ca. 1&#8197;&#197; from one system to another. Spectroelectrochemical study detects the formation of IVCT band at the NIR region between cofacially oriented DPTTZ molecules in both MOFs. Transient spectroscopy shows faster charge separation as well as charge recombination when intra&#8208;dimer distance is lesser (in MOF 2) due to stronger electronic coupling. We quantify the extent of IVCT by charge transfer integral calculation; and also by optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy, where MOF 2 shows three times higher carrier mobility due to lesser inter&#8208;DPTTZ distance than MOF 1. These findings reveal a more localized aspect of through&#8208;space IVCT between cofacially organized redox&#8208;active pair in a three&#8208;dimensional framework.

         <title>Inside Cover: Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 31/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
Exploring new fields: Lanthanide&#8208;using bacteria that turn over methane or methanol in their metabolism can replace essential lanthanides by certain actinides. In their Research Article (e202303669), Lena&#8197;J. Daumann et&#8197;al. show that an extremophile isolated from a volcanic mud&#8208;pot as well as a methylotrophic laboratory strain can use americium and curium. In vivo growth experiments as well as in vitro studies with the key metabolic enzyme methanol dehydrogenase support that these actinides can sustain the one&#8208;carbon metabolism of these bacteria.

Single&#8208;cell analysis is an effective method to reveal cell heterogeneity. In their Research Article (e202302000), Yujun Song et&#8197;al. report an enzyme&#8208;loaded metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;integrated microfluidic chip for highly efficient single&#8208;cell capture followed by real&#8208;time single&#8208;cell metabolite monitoring and analysis. By profiling intracellular glucose and extracellular lactate, the platform could evaluate the single&#8208;cell tumorigenicity of tumor cells in unprocessed whole blood samples.

Axially enantioselective binuclear gold(I) catalysts fly as swallowtail butterflies around a mechanical hand providing a chiral environment. The gold microchip on the hand symbolizes the crucial role of gold catalysis in alkyne activation. Using the gold&#8208;catalyzed condensation of amine and diyne&#8208;ene, the first example of enantioselective 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion is reported by Xin Hong, Xiaodong Shi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202305409).

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Photocatalytic Activation of CO2 in Ionic Liquids Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208; and photocatalytic CO2 activation by and in ionic liquids (ILs) offers sustainable fuels and valuable products. ILs form ionic nano&#8208;cages around the catalysts which are akin to membrane&#8208;like devices that selectively control the permeability/diffusion of substrates, intermediates, and products. In this minireview, the potential of ILs for academic research and the chemical industry are summarized.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered to be potential material devices for CO2 capturing and conversion to energy&#8208;adducts. They form a cage (confined&#8208;space) around the catalyst providing an ionic nano&#8208;container environment which serves as physical&#8208;chemical barrier that selectively controls the diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products to the catalytic active sites via their hydrophobicity and contact ion pairs. Hence, the electronic properties of the catalysts in ILs can be tuned by the proper choice of the IL&#8208;cations and anions that strongly influence the residence time/diffusion of the reactants, intermediates, and products in the nano&#8208;environment. On the other hand, ILs provide driving force towards photocatalytic redox process to increase the CO2 photoreduction. By combining ILs with the semiconductor, unique solid semiconductor&#8208;liquid commodities are generated that can lower the CO2 activation energy barrier by modulating the electronic properties of the semiconductor surface. This mini&#8208;review provides a brief overview of the recent advances in IL assisted thermal conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons, formic acid, methanol, dimethyl carbonate, and cyclic carbonates as well as its photo&#8208;conversion to solar fuels.

         <title>Hybrid Monomer Design Synergizing Property Trade&#8208;offs in Developing Polymers for Circularity and Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid monomer design can unify desired but conflicting properties in a single monomer that in turn leads to intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties that can be radically different than those of the parent homopolymers or copolymers.







Abstract
Current search for more sustainable plastics seeks to redesign polymers possessing both chemical recyclability to monomer for a circular plastics economy and desirable performance that can rival or even exceed today's non&#8208;recyclable or hard&#8208;to&#8208;recycle petroleum&#8208;based incumbents. However, within a traditional monomer framework it is challenging to optimize, concurrently, contrasting polymerizability/depolymerizability and recyclability/performance properties. Here, we highlight the emerging hybrid monomer design strategy to develop intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties, aiming to unify desired, but otherwise conflicting, properties in a single monomer. Conceptually, this design hybridizes parent monomer pairs of contrasting, mismatching, or matching properties into offspring monomers that not only unify the above&#8208;described conflicting properties but also radically alter the resultant polymer properties far beyond the limits of what either parent homopolymers or their copolymers can achieve.

         <title>Exploiting Interactions between Polyoxometalates and Proteins for Applications in (Bio)chemistry and Medicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>

This Review aims to provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the interactions between polyoxometalates and proteins that make this vast family of anionic nanoclusters interesting potential inorganic drugs, effective catalysts for selective protein modification, multifunctional crystallizing agents, and versatile protein separation materials.







Abstract
The specific interactions of anionic metal&#8208;oxo clusters, known as polyoxometalates (POMs), with proteins can be leveraged for a wide range of analytical and biomedical applications. For example, POMs have been developed as selective catalysts that can induce protein modifications and have also been shown to facilitate protein crystallization, both of which are instrumental in the structural characterization of proteins. POMs can also be used for selective protein separation and enzyme inhibition, which makes them promising therapeutic agents. Hence, understanding POM&#8208;protein interactions is essential for the development of POM&#8208;based materials and their implementation in several fields. In this Review we summarize in detail the key insights that have been gained so far on POM&#8208;protein interactions. Emphasis is also given to hybrid POMs functionalized with organic ligands to prompt further research in this direction owing to the promising recent results on tuning POM&#8208;protein interactions through POM functionalization.

         <title>Enantioselective Strategies for The Synthesis of N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers are highlighted and discussed within this Review. In particular, the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric architecture are presented while a particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Axially chiral compounds have been always considered a laboratory curiosity with rare prospects of being applied in asymmetric synthesis. Things have changed very quickly in the last twenty years when it was understood the important role and the enormous impact that these compounds have in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers became a rapidly expanding field and recent reports on the development of N&#8722;N atropisomers strongly prove how this research field is a hot topic open to new challenges and frontiers of asymmetric synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers highlighting the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric framework.

         <title>Connecting Ruthenium Photocatalysis to 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane&#8208;Mediated Chemiluminescence: a Versatile Combination for Optical Detection and Read&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful linkage of ruthenium photocatalysis with highly sensitive and selectively triggerable chemiluminescence read&#8208;out from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is demonstrated. The ruthenium&#8208;dioxetane system was shown to be useful for the quantification of optical input by inverse correlation with optical output. Further on, the system was applied to detect the Ru(bpy)3Cl2 catalyst at nanomolar concentrations, highlighting the future applicability.







Abstract
Optical storage and photon quantification systems based on sensitive photoreactions have numerous applications. Herein, we report a highly efficient photocatalytic reaction, in which ruthenium photoredox catalysis is combined with a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane from which chemiluminescence can be triggered. In this system, blue light irradiation as optical input enables a defined inverse correlation with base&#8208;triggered, blue light emission as optical output.

     alt="Connecting Ruthenium Photocatalysis to 1,2-Dioxetane-Mediated Chemiluminescence: a Versatile Combination for Optical Detection and Read-Out"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful linkage of ruthenium photocatalysis with highly sensitive and selectively triggerable chemiluminescence read-out from a 1,2-dioxetane is demonstrated. The ruthenium-dioxetane system was shown to be useful for the quantification of optical input by inverse correlation with optical output. Further on, the system was applied to detect the Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst at nanomolar concentrations, highlighting the future applicability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical storage and photon quantification systems based on sensitive photoreactions have numerous applications. Herein, we report a highly efficient photocatalytic reaction, in which ruthenium photoredox catalysis is combined with a 1,2-dioxetane from which chemiluminescence can be triggered. In this system, blue light irradiation as optical input enables a defined inverse correlation with base-triggered, blue light emission as optical output. Comparison of readout by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR and chemiluminescence, relative to previous optical input, underlines the reliability and usefulness of the ruthenium-dioxetane system for optical storage, sensing and ruthenium detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Production of Multivariate, Hyperdimensional End Group and Main Chain Functionalized Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly versatile and general strategy is presented and experimentally validated for production of an endless variety of functionalized polyolefins through the (stereoselective) living coordinative (chain transfer) copolymerization of 1&#8208;alkenes and 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,6&#8208;heptadienes as comonomers. This includes telechelic polyolefins with orthogonal reactive end&#8208;group and main&#8208;chain functionality and microphase&#8208;segregated &#8220;two&#8208;color&#8221; block copolymers.







Abstract
The (stereoselective) living coordinative copolymerization of 1&#8208;alkenes with 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,6&#8208;heptadienes, in both the absence and presence of multiple equivalents of a reversible chain transfer agent, is established as a highly versatile strategy for production of multivariate hyperdimensional functionalized semi&#8208;crystalline or amorphous polyolefins that optionally possess either mono&#8208; or difunctionalized (telechelic) end&#8208;groups in combination with a programmable level of incorporation of orthogonal functional groups within the main&#8208;chain. The non&#8208;conjugated diene comonomers are readily obtained from a diverse range of aryl carboxaldehyde precursors through a one&#8208;step bis&#8208;allylation process. These results serve to provide a new platform for exploring the science and technology of a vast new landscape of functionalized classes of polyolefins that are now accessible in practical and scalable quantities.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Covered with Biomolecular Machine &#8220;Chaperonin GroEL&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanoparticle covered with the biomolecular machine &#8220;chaperonin GroEL&#8221; (GroELNP) allows the capture of denatured proteins and their controlled release in response to ATP and shows a nearly 5&#8208;times enhanced ATPase activity compared to the precursor GroEL. Building on GroELNP, 
NP having two layers of GroEL was iteratively synthesized, demonstrating the potential to construct higher&#8208;order structures therefrom.







Abstract
Herein, we report an ATP&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (GroELNP) whose surface is fully covered with the biomolecular machine &#8220;chaperonin protein GroEL&#8221;. GroELNP was synthesized by DNA hybridization between a gold NP with DNA strands on its surface and GroEL carrying complementary DNA strands at its apical domains. The unique structure of GroELNP was visualized by transmission electron microscopy including under cryogenic conditions. The immobilized GroEL units retain their machine&#8208;like function and enable GroELNP to capture denatured green fluorescent protein and release it in response to ATP. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of GroELNP per GroEL was 4.8 and 4.0 times greater than those of precursor cysGroEL and its DNA&#8208;functionalized analogue, respectively. Finally, we confirmed that GroELNP could be iteratively extended to double&#8208;layered 
NP.

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Hindered Molecular p&#8208;Dopants Promote Integer Charge Transfer in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integer charge transfer in the p&#8208;doping of organic semiconductors can be suppressed by intermolecular hybridization reducing the doping efficiency. We test the hypothesis that steric hindrance can be exploited to inhibit this process for a novel three&#8208;dimensional dopant whose doping behavior is contrasted with an equally strong planar species. We find that utilizing steric hindrance in dopant design indeed promotes integer charge transfer.







Abstract
Molecular p&#8208;dopants designed to undergo electron transfer with organic semiconductors are typically planar molecules with high electron affinity. However, their planarity can promote the formation of ground&#8208;state charge transfer complexes with the semiconductor host and results in fractional instead of integer charge transfer, which is highly detrimental to doping efficiency. Here, we show this process can be readily overcome by targeted dopant design exploiting steric hindrance. To this end, we synthesize and characterize the remarkably stable p&#8208;dopant 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(cyclopropane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triylidene)tris(2&#8208;(perfluorophenyl)acetonitrile) comprising pendant functional groups that sterically shield its central core while retaining high electron affinity. Finally, we demonstrate it outperforms a planar dopant of identical electron affinity and increases the thin film conductivity by up to an order of magnitude. We believe exploiting steric hindrance represents a promising design strategy towards molecular dopants of enhanced doping efficiency.

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization and Fluorogenic Labeling of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methyltransferase ribozyme (MTR1) catalyzes site&#8208;specific alkylation of a purine nucleobase to initiate the formation of the 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;formylimidazole nucleobase analogue, which serves as the precursor for the fluorogenic condensation with a trimethylindole moiety to yield fluorescent hemicyanine&#8208;labeled RNA. The reaction with other aldehyde&#8208;reactive probes is also demonstrated for short RNAs as well as fluorescent labeling of full&#8208;length tRNA.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific introduction of bioorthogonal handles into RNAs is in high demand for decorating RNAs with fluorophores, affinity labels or other modifications. Aldehydes represent attractive functional groups for post&#8208;synthetic bioconjugation reactions. Here, we report a ribozyme&#8208;based method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;functionalized RNA by directly converting a purine nucleobase. Using the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 as an alkyltransferase, the reaction is initiated by site&#8208;specific N1 benzylation of purine, followed by nucleophilic ring opening and spontaneous hydrolysis under mild conditions to yield a 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;formylimidazole residue in good yields. The modified nucleotide is accessible to aldehyde&#8208;reactive probes, as demonstrated by the conjugation of biotin or fluorescent dyes to short synthetic RNAs and tRNA transcripts. Upon fluorogenic condensation with a 2,3,3&#8208;trimethylindole, a novel hemicyanine chromophore was generated directly on the RNA. This work expands the MTR1 ribozyme's area of application from a methyltransferase to a tool for site&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage functionalization of RNA.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydrative Aldol Reaction (HAR) via Vinyl&#8208;Gold Promoted Intermolecular Ynamide Addition to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of Fe(acac)3 as a cocatalyst prevents vinyl gold protodeauration, allowing for its nucleophilic addition to aldehydes. Hence, the intermolecular vinyl gold&#8208;promoted asymmetric hydrative aldol reaction (HAR) of ynamides and aldehydes was shown possible and is herein presented. The reaction leads to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides with high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r, 99&#8201;% ee) under mild conditions (base&#8208;free, 40&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Herein, we reported an intermolecular asymmetric hydrative aldol reaction through vinyl&#8208;gold intermediate under ambient conditions. This tandem alkyne hydration and sequential nucleophilic addition afforded a &#8220;base&#8208;free&#8221; approach to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides with high efficiency (up to 95&#8201;% yields, &gt;50 examples). Vinyl gold intermediate was applied as reactive nucleophile and Fe(acac)3 was used as the critical co&#8208;catalyst to prevent undesired protodeauration, allowing this transformation to proceed under mild conditions with good functional group tolerance and excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r. and up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoboxes Enable Accelerated Redox Kinetics and Polysulfide Trapping for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) are rationally designed and prepared via the cation and ligand exchange reactions to serve as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8722;S batteries. Benefiting from the hollow architecture and atomically dispersed Co&#8722;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and superior cycling stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems in view of the high theoretical energy density and low cost of sulfur resources. The suppression of polysulfide diffusion and promotion of redox kinetics are the main challenges for Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, we design and prepare a novel type of ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) to serve as a functional sulfur host for Li&#8722;S batteries. The hollow architecture of ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can ensure fast charge transfer, improved sulfur utilization, and effective confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The atomically dispersed Co&#8722;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can firmly capture LiPSs and electrocatalytically accelerate their conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple structural advantages, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and prolonged cycling performance for 300&#8197;cycles.

         <title>A Humidity&#8208;Induced Large Electronic Conductivity Change of 107 on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Sensitive Water Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;induced large electronic conductivity change of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed with the &#8722;NH2 groups, and H2SO4 played an important role in regulating the conductivity. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, a high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensor was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range and lowest limit of detection amongst all the reported sensing materials to date.







Abstract
The electronic conductivity (EC) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is sensitive to strongly oxidizing guest molecules. Water is a relatively mild species, however, the effect of H2O on the EC of MOFs is rarely reported. We explored the effect of H2O on the EC in the MOFs (NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and its derivatives with experimental and theoretical investigations. Unexpectedly, a large EC increase of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 by H2O was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed with the &#8722;NH2 groups, and H2SO4 played an important role in promoting the charge transfer from H2O to the MOF. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, a high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensor was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range, and lowest limit of detection amongst all reported sensing materials to date. This work not only demonstrated that H2O can remarkably influence the EC of MOFs, but it also revealed that post&#8208;modification of the structure of MOFs could enhance the influence of the guest molecule on their EC to design high&#8208;performance sensing materials.

         <title>Active Ensembles in Methane Dehydroaromatization over Molybdenum/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Identified by 2D 1H&#8722;95Mo Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D 1H&#8208;95Mo heteronuclear correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy was used to reveal the active ensembles formed in the methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reaction over Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. The evolution of the local environment consisting of Mo species, acidic sites, and organic compounds was monitored during the reaction. Two types of active MoOxCy species were observed, which were differentiated by correlating with the MDA activity.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) over Mo&#8208;modified zeolite is a potential catalytic route for converting natural gas into valuable aromatics. However, the active species in this reaction are highly complex, involving diverse Mo species, acidic sites of zeolite, and organic molecules. Herein, we apply 1D 95Mo NMR and 2D 1H&#8208;95Mo heteronuclear correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to directly observe the active ensembles in the confined channels of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite during the MDA reaction. We monitor the evolution of the spatial correlations of Mo species with the Br&#248;nsted acid sites and organic products (olefins and aromatics) in the zeolite channels. We identified two kinds of MoOxCy species, with the more carbidic one (MoOxCy&#8208;II) exhibiting higher activity for methane activation and benzene formation. The strong spatial interactions between the active Mo species and the organic species in the Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 pores are related to the MDA activity.

The enaminone&#8208;linked COFs (En&#8208;COFs) are synthesized and firstly attempted for photocatalysis. Compared with the corresponding imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) and quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (Qu&#8208;COFs) with almost identical structures but altered linkages, En&#8208;COFs possess boosted photocatalytic activity with extended light adsorption, facilitated exciton dissociation and improved stability, making them a promising platform for enhanced photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), possessing pre&#8208;designable structures and tailorable functionalities, are promising candidates for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the most studied imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) usually suffer from unsatisfactory stability and photocatalytic performance. To meet this challenge, a series of highly stable enaminone&#8208;linked COFs (En&#8208;COFs) have been synthesized and afford much improved visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production activities, ranging from 44 to 1078&#8197;times that of isoreticular Im&#8208;COFs, with the only difference being the linkages (enaminone vs. imine) in their structures. The enhanced light&#8208;harvesting ability, facilitated exciton dissociation and improved chemical stability account for the superior activity. Furthermore, quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (Qu&#8208;COFs) have been further obtained via the post&#8208;modification of Im&#8208;COFs. Compared with Im&#8208;COFs, the photocatalytic activities of Qu&#8208;COFs are significantly improved after modification, but still below those of the corresponding En&#8208;COFs (3&#8211;107&#8197;times). The facile synthesis, excellent activity, and high chemical stability demonstrate that En&#8208;COFs are a promising platform for photocatalysis.

         <title>Dynamical Equilibrium between Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Sites in Zeolites: Framework&#8208;Associated Octahedral Aluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The details of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum are revealed for the first time, based on a combined experimental and computational study. Framework&#8208;associated Al(Oh) becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions at sufficiently low Si/Al, while its thermodynamic stability with respect to regular Br&#248;nsted tetrahedral site decreases with decreasing water loading.







Abstract
While the structures of Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites are well understood, those of Lewis acid sites (LAS) remain an active area of investigation. Under hydrated conditions, the reversible formation of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum has been observed in zeolites in the acidic form. However, the structure and formation mechanisms are currently unknown. In this work, combined experimental 27Al NMR spectroscopy and computational data reveal for the first time the details of the zeolite framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium. The octahedral LAS site becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions in the presence of multiple nearby BAS sites. The critical condition for the existence of such octahedral LAS appears to be the availability of three protons: at lower proton concentration, either by increasing the Si/Al or by ion&#8208;exchange to non&#8208;acidic form, the tetrahedral BAS becomes thermodynamically more stable. This work resolves the question about the nature and reversibility of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium in zeolites.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Illisimonin&#8197;A and Merrilactone&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive biosynthetic pathway was proposed for illicium sesquiterpenes. The key transformations of the biosynthetic pathway, which include retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction, were supported by the total syntheses of illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A from a common intermediate.







Abstract
Illicium sesquiterpenes are a large family of biologically active secondary metabolites isolated from Illicium species of plants and are well&#8208;known for their activity of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Herein, we propose a comprehensive biosynthetic pathway for illicium sesquiterpenes and report a synthetic route to illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A based on it. We think that the carbon scaffolds of most of the illicium sesquiterpenes could be synthesized from a dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane through retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction at suitable oxidation states in Nature. The common intermediate for illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A similar to the dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane was assembled with up to 82&#8201;% ee by an asymmetric intramolecular desymmetrizing reductive Heck reaction by the use of a new type of chiral phosphine ligand. The syntheses of illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A supported the key transformations of the proposed biosynthetic pathway.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of the Bacterial Sesterviridene Synthase from Kitasatospora viridis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase has been discovered from Kitasatospora viridis that produces sesterviridene&#8197;A in high yield. Several derivatives were synthesised, confirming the NMR based structure elucidation. The absolute configuration was determined through chemical correlation and anomalous dispersion X&#8208;ray. The cyclisation mechanism of the sesterviridene synthase StvirS was deeply studied in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A gene coding for a terpene synthase homolog from Kitasatospora viridis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein possessed sesterterpene synthase activity and efficiently converted geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP) with 19&#8201;% yield into the sesterterpene hydrocarbon sesterviridene&#8197;A. Large scale enzymatic conversions also allowed for the isolation of two side products that are generated with very low yields of ca. 0.1&#8201;%. Several derivatives of sesterviridene&#8197;A were obtained by chemical transformations, securing the NMR&#8208;based structural assignments. The absolute configuration of sesterviridene&#8197;A was determined by chemical correlation using stereoselectively deuterated precursors and by anomalous dispersion X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cyclisation mechanism from GFPP to sesterviridene&#8197;A was extensively studied through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Emitters Enable High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Red Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of narrowband red fluorescent emitters based on a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton were designed. These emitters explore the use of a methyl&#8208;shield strategy to assemble high&#8208;performance narrowband red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on traditional fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are receiving significant attention and have demonstrated impressive performance in blue and green OLEDs. However, developing high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs remains a highly desired yet challenging task. Herein, we have developed narrowband red fluorescent emitters by utilizing a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton in combination with a methyl&#8208;shield strategy. These emitters exhibit small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) ranging from 21&#8197;nm (0.068&#8197;eV) to 25&#8197;nm (0.081&#8197;eV) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) ranging from 88.5&#8201;% to 99.0&#8201;% in toluene solution. Using BODIPY&#8208;based luminescent materials as emitters, high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs have been assembled with external quantum efficiency as high as 18.3&#8201;% at 623&#8197;nm and 21.1&#8201;% at 604&#8197;nm. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first successful case of achieving NTSC pure&#8208;red OLEDs with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of [0.67, 0.33] based on conventional fluorescent emitters.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Biomimetic Extracellular Matrix for Cell Nanoencapsulation and Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic extracellular matrix is synthesized on the surface of live cells as a cell nanocapsule to carry nanoparticles. Nanoparticles at the vicinity of the encapsulated cell surface allow for on&#8208;demand regulation of intracellular gene expression. As any or multiple nanoparticles can be applied to decorate the nanocapsule, this work demonstrates a promising technology platform for cell encapsulation and regulation.







Abstract
Cell encapsulation has been studied for various applications ranging from cell transplantation to biological production. However, current encapsulation technologies focus on cell protection rather than cell regulation that is essential to most if not all cell&#8208;based applications. Here we report a method for cell nanoencapsulation and regulation using an ultrathin biomimetic extracellular matrix as a cell nanocapsule to carry nanoparticles (CN2). This method allows high&#8208;capacity nanoparticle retention at the vicinity of cell surfaces. The encapsulated cells maintain high viability and normal metabolism. When gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as a model to decorate the nanocapsule, light irradiation transiently increases the temperature, leading to the activation of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter and the regulation of reporter gene expression. As the biomimetic nanocapsule can be decorated with any or multiple NPs, CN2 is a promising platform for advancing cell&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Anthracene&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin dimer and trimer oligomers were synthesized by fusing porphyrin and anthracene units in an edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge manner. Efficient intramolecular &#960;&#8208;delocalization is demonstrated by absorption spectra extending far into the near&#8208;IR and by high redox activity. This is a promising strategy for incorporating metal ions into a 1D semiconductor through solution&#8208;phase synthesis.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated nanoribbons attract interest because of their unusual electronic structures and charge&#8208;transport behavior. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of fully edge&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;anthracene oligomeric ribbons (dimer and trimer), together with a computational study of the corresponding infinite polymer. The porphyrin dimer and trimer were synthesized in high yield, via oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of singly linked precursors, using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). The crystal structure of the dimer shows that the central &#960;&#8208;system is flat, with a slight S&#8208;shaped wave distortion at each porphyrin terminal. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation causes a dramatic red&#8208;shift in the absorption spectra: the absorption maxima of the fused dimer and trimer appear at 1188&#8197;nm and 1642&#8197;nm, respectively (for the nickel complexes dissolved in toluene). The coordinated metal in the dimer was changed from Ni to Mg, using p&#8208;tolylmagnesium bromide, providing access to free&#8208;base and Zn complexes. These results open a versatile avenue to longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanoribbons with integrated metalloporphyrin units.

Gouws, Professor Hendrik&#8197;G. Kruger, and Professor Tricia Naicker from the Catalysis and Peptide Research Unit at the University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban (South Africa); Professor Olivier Gheysens from the Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint&#8208;Luc and Institute of Clinical and Experimental Research, Universit&#233; Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium); and ProfessorThavendran Govender from the Department of Chemistry, University of Zululand, KwaDlangezwa (South Africa). Researchers at these institutes have a 10&#8208;year track record of joint publications. The review written by this collaboration provides a summary of the relevant antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiotracers, grouped either by radiotracer development for infection imaging, or radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging for pharmacologic drug characterization.

         <title>Proton/Mg2+ Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Mg&#8208;Ion Batteries: From the Interface to the Inner</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;insertion of protons happens widely and enables divalent&#8208;ion aqueous batteries to achieve high performances. However, detailed investigations and comprehensive understandings of proton co&#8208;insertion are scarce.Herein, we demonstrate that proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution, the formation of Mg&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO2(B) electrode and co&#8208;insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg2++H2O is 2.7 eV, while that of the protons is 0.37 eV. Thus, protons dominate the subsequent insertion and inner diffusion.As a consequence, the VO2(B) achieves a high capacity of 257.0 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 A g&#8211;1, a high rate retention of 59.1% from 1 to 8 A g&#8211;1, and stable cyclability of 3000 times with a capacity retention of 81.5%. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the proton co&#8208;insertion and may promote the development of rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electronegative Channels as Cationic Highways for Sustainable Lithium Metal Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous interest in Li metal as an ideal anode material, the uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have plagued its practical application. These limitations can be attributed to the sluggish and uneven Li+ migration towards Li metal surface. Here, we report olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron&#8208;rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78 mS cm&#8722;1). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700 h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetalation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetalation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Bidirectional Axial Coordination into BiVO4@Metal Phthalocyanine Core&#8211;Shell Photoanodes for Efficient Water Oxidation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;shell photoanodes have shown great potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the construction of a high&#8208;quality interface between the core and shell, as well as a highly catalytic surface, remains a challenge. Herein, guided by computation, we present a BiVO4 photoanode coated with ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine using pyrazine as a coordination agent. The bidirectional axial coordination of pyrazine plays a dual role by facilitating intimate interfacial contact between BiVO4 and ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine, as well as regulating the electron density and spin configuration of metal sites in ZnCoFe phthalocyanine, thereby promoting the potential&#8208;limiting step of *OOH desorption. The resulting photoanode displayed a high photocurrent density of 5.7&#177;0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 VRHE. This study introduces a new approach for constructing core&#8208;shell photoanodes, and uncovers the key role of pyrazine axial coordination in modulating the catalytic activity of metal phthalocyanine.</dc:description>

         <title>One/Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Excited ESIPT&#8208;Attributed Coordination Polymers with Wide Temperature Range and Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple metastable excited states provided by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules are beneficial to bring temperature&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL). Meanwhile, ESIPT molecules are intrinsically suitable to be modulated as D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure to obtain both one/two&#8208;photon excitation and LPL emission simultaneously. Herein, we report the rational design of a dynamic Cd(II) coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) from ESIPT ligand to achieve the above goals. By comparing LIFM&#8208;106 with the counterparts, we established a temperature&#8208;regulated competitive relationship between singlet excimer and triplet LPL emission. The optimization of ligand aggregation mode effectively boost the competitiveness of the latter. In result, LIFM&#8208;106 shows outstanding one/two&#8208;photon excited LPL performance with wide temperature range (100 &#8208; 380 K) and tunable color (green to red). The multichannel radiation process was further elucidated by transient absorption and theoretical calculations, benefiting for the application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Defect&#8208;Induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the structure and spatial distance of Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites in a porous system to construct efficient solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst is vital for industrial application but remains challenging. Herein, we constructed FLP sites in a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) by introducing coordination&#8208;defect metal nodes (LA) and surface&#8208;basic POM with abundant oxygen (LB). The well&#8208;defined and unique spatial conformation of the defective POM&#8208;based MOF ensure that the distance between LA and LB is at ~4.3 &#197;, a suitable distance to activate H2. This FLP catalyst can heterolytically dissociate H2 into active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting high activity in hydrogenation, which is 55 and 2.7 times as high as that of defect&#8208;free POM&#8208;based MOF and defective MOF without POM, respectively. This work provides a new avenue toward precise design multi&#8208;site catalyst to achieve specific activation of target substrate for synergistic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing the Crystallinity and Film Formation of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes through In Situ Modulation for Efficient Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) layers hold great promise as molecular sieve membranes for efficient gas separation. Nevertheless, the high crystallinity tends to cause inter&#8208;crystalline defects/cracks in the nearby crystals, which makes crystalline porous materials face a great challenge in the fabrication of defect&#8208;free membranes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the balance between crystallinity and film&#8208;formation of MOF membrane through a facile in situ modulation strategy. Monocarboxylic acid was introduced as a modulator to regulate the crystallinity via competitive complexation and thus concomitantly control the film&#8208;forming state during membrane growth. Through adjusting the ratio of modulator acid/linker acid, an appropriate balance between this structural &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; was achieved. The resulting MOF membrane with moderate crystallinity and coherent morphology exhibits molecular sieving for H2/CO2 separation with selectivity  up to 82.5.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low&#160;Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3&#160;using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature&#160;and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130 kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic Synthesis: Concepts and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis represents an exciting merger of selective biocatalysis and green electrochemical methods for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. In this review we introduce the key concepts and vital applications of both enzymatic and microbial electrosynthetic systems.







Abstract
Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis is the conversion of electrical energy into value&#8208;added products using biocatalysts. These methods merge the specificity and selectivity of biocatalysis and energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis to address challenges in the sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, fuels, feedstocks and fertilizers. However, the specialized experimental setups and domain knowledge for bioelectrocatalysis pose a significant barrier to adoption. This review introduces key concepts of bioelectrosynthetic systems. We provide a tutorial on the methods of biocatalyst utilization, the setup of bioelectrosynthetic cells, and the analytical methods for assessing bioelectrocatalysts. Key applications of bioelectrosynthesis in ammonia production and small&#8208;molecule synthesis are outlined for both enzymatic and microbial systems. This review serves as a necessary introduction and resource for the non&#8208;specialist interested in bioelectrosynthetic research.

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle the concentration polarization and drive the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a 24&#8208;fold improvement generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%) as compared with the bare one.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration polarization, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra&#8208;low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high&#8208;level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst, a 24&#8208;fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.

         <title>Cooperative Network Formation via Two&#8208;Colour Light&#8208;Activated &#955;&#8208;Orthogonal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterotelechelic dilinker enables the generation of a polymer network exclusively via dual&#8208;colour irradiation. In contrast, single&#8208;colour irradiation results in polymer functionalization.







Abstract
Independently addressing photoreactive sites within one molecule with two colours of light is a formidable challenge. Here, we combine two sequence independent &#955;&#8208;orthogonal chromophores in one heterotelechelic dilinker molecule, to exploit their disparate reactivity utilizing the same reaction partner, a maleimide&#8208;containing polymer. We demonstrate that polymer network formation only proceeds if two colours of light are employed. Upon single colour irradiation, linker&#8208;decorated post&#8208;functionalized polymers are generated at either wavelength and in either sequence. Network formation, however, is only achieved by sequential or simultaneous two colour irradiation. The herein introduced photoreactive system demonstrates the power of wavelength orthogonal chemistry in macromolecular synthesis.

         <title>Reforming the Uniformity of Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Nanoscale Structure Regulation for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is proposed and constructed to improve the uniformity of SEI, in which LiNxOy generated by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives occupies the top layer and LiF formed by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) dominates the bottom layer next to lithium metal anodes. A lithium metal pouch cell with a specific energy of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the cell level undergoes 173&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active lithium and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe N1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated 1,2,4&#8208;triazinium salts as new bioorthogonal reagents. These heterodienes are stable under biological conditions and react selectively and at high rates with strained alkynes such as BCN, allowing efficient modification of biomolecules. The unique ionic character makes the compounds more water soluble and cell permeable. These features enable efficient labeling of intracellular targets in living cells.







Abstract
The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice compression at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale was first achieved in a newly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 nanocluster, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction compared to the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 nanocluster without lattice variation. DFT calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Lattice tuning at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a &#8776;1&#8197;nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 (CHT=S&#8208;c&#8722;C6H11) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58&#8197;&#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice&#8208;compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) compared to that exhibited by the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters. Further theoretical calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity.

         <title>Artificial Urinary Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial biomarker probes (AMPro) are developed for noninvasive urinalysis of acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) in murine models. With advantages of high renal clearance and specific detection of graft&#8208;infiltrating immune cells, AMPros noninvasively detected the onset of ARAR as accurate as invasive flow cytometry analysis, and specifically distinguished ARAR from non&#8208;allograft diseases or non&#8208;alloimmune&#8208;specific inflammatory patterns.







Abstract
Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) after kidney transplantation associated with reduced graft survival and eventual graft failure is poorly diagnosed in hospitals. Here, we report the development of Artificial bioMarker Probes (AMPros) for sensitive urinalysis of ARAR in murine models. AMPros spontaneously go to the kidneys after systemic administration, specifically react with the prodromal immune biomarkers to activate their near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals to report cell&#8208;mediated rejection, and efficiently undergo renal excretion into urine. Thus, AMPros enable convenient optical urinalysis that detects ARAR prior to histological manifestation of rejection, which is also earlier than current diagnostic methods measuring proinflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNAs. Due to the high kidney specificity, AMPros&#8208;based urinalysis discriminates allograft rejection against other non&#8208;alloimmune specific diseases, which is unattainable by measurement of serological biomarkers. Such a noninvasive and sensitive urine test holds great promise in continuous monitoring of renal allograft conditions at low resource settings for timely clinical interventions.

         <title>Tracking an FeV(O) Intermediate for Water Oxidation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand is effective at stabilizing high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates involved in the water oxidation reaction. UV/Vis, XAS, EPR, electrochemical and kinetic measurements, allow a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species that participates in O&#8722;O bond formation with higher reactivity and shorter lifetime to be tracked in a real catalytic water oxidation reaction.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species are appealing for conducting O&#8722;O bond formation for water oxidation reactions. However, their high reactivity poses a great challenge to the dissection of their chemical transformations. Herein, we introduce an electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand, 2&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;6&#8208;yl]propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol to stabilize such fleeting intermediates. Advanced spectroscopies and electrochemical studies demonstrate a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species formation in water. Combining kinetic and oxygen isotope labelling experiments and organic reactions indicates that the FeV(O) species is responsible for O&#8722;O bond formation via water nucleophilic attack under the real catalytic water oxidation conditions.

         <title>Unravelling the Superiority of Nonbenzenoid Acepleiadylene as a Building Block for Organic Semiconducting Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonbenzenoid acepleiadylene (APD) has been explored as a new building block to construct organic electronic material (APD&#8208;IID), which exhibits higher hole mobility than its pyrene&#8208;based isomers because of the stronger intermolecular interaction induced by the unique charge&#8208;separated character. These results demonstrate the superiority of nonbenzenoid arenes in the future development of organic semiconducting materials.







Abstract
Acepleiadylene (APD), a nonbenzenoid isomer of pyrene, exhibits a unique charge&#8208;separated character with a large molecular dipole and a small optical gap. However, APD has never been explored in optoelectronic materials to take advantage of these appealing properties. Here, we employ APD as a building block in organic semiconducting materials for the first time, and unravel the superiority of nonbenzenoid APD in electronic applications. We have synthesized an APD derivative (APD&#8208;IID) with APD as the terminal donor moieties and isoindigo (IID) as the acceptor core. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that APD&#8208;IID has an obvious charge&#8208;separated structure and enhanced intermolecular interactions as compared with its pyrene&#8208;based isomers. As a result, APD&#8208;IID displays significantly higher hole mobilities than those of the pyrene&#8208;based counterparts. These results imply the advantages of employing APD in semiconducting materials and great potential of nonbenzenoid polycyclic arenes for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Pore Modulation of Hydrogen&#8722;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that combine functional sites, size control, and storage capability for targeting gas molecule capture is a novel and challenging venture. However, there is a lack of effective strategies to tune the hydrogen&#8722;bonded network to achieve high&#8208;performance HOFs. Here, a series of HOFs termed as HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;M (M = 1, 2, and 3) with different pore structures are obtained by introducing structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs) into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). These HOFs have distinct space configurations with pore channels ranging from discrete to continuous multi&#8208;dimensional. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals a rare diversity of hydrogen&#8722;bonding models dominated by SDAs. HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2, which forms a strong layered hydrogen&#8722;bonding network with ammonium (NH4+) through multiple carboxyl groups, has a suitable 1D "pearl&#8208;chain&#8221; channel for the selective capture of propylene (C3H6). At 298 K and 1 bar, the C3H6 storage density of HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 reaches 0.6 kg L&#8208;1, representing one of the best C3H6 storage materials, while offering a propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) selectivity of 12.2. Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ SCXRD provide a detailed analysis of the binding strength of C3H6 at different locations in the pearl&#8208;chain channel. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirm that HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 can effectively separate C3H6 from multi&#8208;mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative and Orthogonal Switching in the Solid State Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#160;Confinement Leading to a Thermo&#8208;Photochromic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative behavior and orthogonal responses of two classes of coordinatively integrated photochromic molecules towards distinct external stimuli were demonstrated on the first example of a photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive hierarchical platform. Synergetic and orthogonal responses to temperature and excitation wavelength are achieved by confining the stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), leading to the preparation of a novel photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive spiropyran&#8208;diarylethene based material. Synergistic behavior of two photoswitches enables the study of stimuli&#8208;responsive resonance energy transfer as well as control of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, milestones required to advance optoelectronics development. Spectroscopic studies in combination with theoretical modeling revealed a nonlinear effect on the material electronic structure arising from the coordinative integration of photoresponsive molecules with distinct photoisomerization mechanisms. Thus, the reported work covers multivariable facets of not only fundamental aspects of photoswitch cooperativity, but also provides a pathway to modulate photophysics and electronics of multidimensional functional materials exhibiting thermo&#8208;photochromism.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) with Anti&#8208;Hook Effect for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimera&#160;(PROTAC) is an emerging pharmacological modality with innovated post&#8208;translational protein degradation capabilities. However, off&#8208;target induced unintended tissue effects and intrinsic &#8220;hook effect&#8221; hinder PROTAC biotechnology to be maturely developed. Herein, an intracellular fabricated nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) modality with a center&#8208;spoke degradation network for achieving efficient dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation in tumor is reported. The PROTAC precursors are triggered by higher GSH concentrations inside tumor cells, which subsequently in situ self&#8208;assemble into Nano&#8208;PROTACs through intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The fibrous Nano&#8208;PROTACs can form effective polynary complexes and E3 ligases degradation network with multi&#8208;binding sites, achieving dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221;. The generality and efficacy of Nano&#8208;PROTACs are validated by degrading variable protein of interest (POI) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (AR) in a wide&#8208;range dose&#8208;dependent manner with a 95 % degradation rate and long&#8208;lasting potency up to 72 h in vitro. Significantly, Nano&#8208;PROTACs achieve in vivo dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation up to 79 % and tumor growth inhibition in A549 and LNCap xenograft mice models, respectively. Taking advantages of in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy, the Nano&#8208;PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to promote precise clinical translational application of PROTAC.</dc:description>
