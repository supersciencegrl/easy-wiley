         <title>A Cu&#8208;Pb Hybrid Layer Architecture as New Structural Prototype for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D Double Perovskite Broadband Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising next&#8208;generation luminescent materials due to their high chemical versatility and excellent broadband light emission properties. However, their practical applications are often limited by low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by insufficient exciton confinement and extended charge&#8208;carrier diffusion lengths within the 2D anionic layers. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel multicomponent structural engineering strategy that led to the design of [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 double perovskites (AMP = 4&#8208;(Aminomethyl)piperidinium, X = Br&#8208; and I&#8208;). These materials feature [Cu2PbX8]4&#8208; monolayers consisting of alternating corner&#8208;sharing [Cu2X6]4&#8208; dimers and [PbX6]4&#8208; octahedra. Compared to the negligible luminescence observed in 2D [AMP]PbX4 analogs, the [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 compounds demonstrate strong broadband yellow&#8208;orange emission originating from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs), achieving high PLQYs exceeding 48%. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporation of [Cu2X6]4&#8208; dimers simultaneously enhances exciton binding energy, electron/hole effective mass, exciton confinement efficiency and STE self&#8208;trapping depth, which are all critical factors contributing to the improved PLQY. This work successfully demonstrates a new class of 2D double perovskites with exceptional luminescent performance, advancing perovskite chemistry through a dual&#8208;engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes both material structure and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Parallel Synthesis of Photo&#8208;cleavable Bifunctional Molecules Enables Efficient Phenotypic Protein Degrader Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenotypic screening offers an effective path for discovering protein degraders, particularly targeting proteins that are poorly characterized or lack sufficient ligand&#8208;binding information. Nonetheless, phenotypic protein degrader discovery (PPDD) faces significant hurdles, such as synthetic complexity in generating chemically diverse libraries and difficulties in reliably identifying degradation&#8208;driven phenotypes in direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology (D2B) screening. In response to these challenges, we developed an integrated PPDD platform that combines optimized solid&#8208;phase parallel synthesis with a robust D2B screening workflow. Leveraging photo&#8208;cleavable linkers and versatile synthetic strategies, this platform facilitates rapid generation of chemically diverse, ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen bifunctional molecule libraries requiring minimal purification. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized and phenotypically screened 130 cereblon&#8208;recruiting molecules, leading to several promising protein degradation&#8208;dependent hits. Subsequent hit optimization and target identification validated compound 12&#8208;60 as a structurally novel GSPT1 degrader with compelling cellular activity. Overall, our integrated platform represents an efficient and practical toolkit for PPDD, establishing a versatile foundation to accelerate future campaigns and expand the degradable proteome.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric&#8208;Dominated Intermediate Stabilization by Organic Cations Enables Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely modulating the binding energies of intermediates through cationic engineering remains a pivotal challenge in controlling reaction pathways and improving selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).&#160;While alkali cations are widely recognized as stabilizing intermediates via electrostatic interactions, this study proposes a steric&#8208;effect&#8208;dominated strategy using organic quaternary ammonium cations (CnTA+) to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates. Through in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), we elucidate that CnTA+ cations with longer alkyl chains substitute K+ more efficiently within the electrical double layer, exhibiting higher affinity for the Cu surface. This steric dominance significantly enhances the adsorption of key intermediates, steering the pathway toward formic acid (HCOOH) production. An improved Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 90% for HCOOH was achieved using octadecyl trimethyl ammonium (C18TA+) cations. This molecular engineering strategy provides a route to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates to improve the performance of CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroboration of Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well&#8208;established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom&#8208;substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac)2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;hydroboration products in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99%). Mechanistic studies including deuterium&#8208;labeling, kinetic, and UV&#8208;Vis experiments suggest the involvement of Co&#8211;H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late&#8208;stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroarylation of Allenes: Formal Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydroarylation of allenyl&#8208;tethered pyrroles and indoles. The reaction, promoted by an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, provides a direct access heteropolycyclic systems bearing either tertiary or quaternary carbon stereocenters, and a synthetically appealing alkenyl pendant. The method allows a highly efficient assembly of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and even seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, providing enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%. DFT computational studies align nicely with the experimental results and allow to rationalize the key factors that control both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process. Finally, the synthetic potential of the method was exemplified with a very short, highly enantioselective formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Functional Groups Into B&#8592;N Organic Frameworks with Permanent Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionality of crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) is engineered by introducing diverse dangling groups. Notably, the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;5 exhibits superior reversible NH&#8323; adsorption compared with their less&#8208; or nonfunctionalized counterparts. Combining high surface areas, low cost, and exceptional sustainability, these functionalized frameworks represent a promising platform for advanced applications.








Abstract
Crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) have garnered increasing interest on account of their crystallinity, porosity, and processability. However, strategies for introducing functions into BNOFs remain largely unexplored. In this work, a series of functionalized BNOFs, named BNOF&#8208;n (n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;9), have been designed and synthesized using a mixed&#8208;monomer assembly strategy. The obtained materials share structural similarities but reveal distinct functional groups, demonstrating excellent chemical stability, high surface areas, and remarkable regenerability. Notably, BNOF&#8208;5, functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups, achieves exceptional reversible NH3 adsorption capacity (up to 10.0&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K), significantly surpassing that of the nonfunctionalized BNOF&#8208;1 (5.6&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) and the less&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;7 (7.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1), thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the functionalization strategy. Remarkably, the damaged BNOF&#8208;5 can be efficiently repaired through facile regeneration, highlighting its outstanding recyclability. This work demonstrates the first attempt at functionalization methodology in BNOFs, extending their potential toward diverse applications.

&lt;p&gt;Crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) have garnered increasing interest on account of their crystallinity, porosity, and processability. However, strategies for introducing functions into BNOFs remain largely unexplored. In this work, a series of functionalized BNOFs, named BNOF-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;9), have been designed and synthesized using a mixed-monomer assembly strategy. The obtained materials share structural similarities but reveal distinct functional groups, demonstrating excellent chemical stability, high surface areas, and remarkable regenerability. Notably, BNOF-5, functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups, achieves exceptional reversible NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity (up to 10.0&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K), significantly surpassing that of the nonfunctionalized BNOF-1 (5.6&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the less-functionalized BNOF-7 (7.9&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the functionalization strategy. Remarkably, the damaged BNOF-5 can be efficiently repaired through facile regeneration, highlighting its outstanding recyclability. This work demonstrates the first attempt at functionalization methodology in BNOFs, extending their potential toward diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Ordering in Low&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskites for Improved X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the ordered molecular arrangement of organic cations in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite and proves its effective promotion effect in improving the electronic carrier transport and suppressing the ion migration. The single crystal based on the highest ordered perovskite achieves a high sensitivity of 8.25&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.15 nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites are emerging semiconductors with excellent photophysical property, chemical stability, and structural diversity and have shown prominence in the fields of solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and X&#8208;ray detectors. To date, the inorganic framework structure in perovskites has been intensively studied, but the molecular arrangement of organic counterparts and its impact on physical properties remains largely unexplored. Herein, we engineer the coordination geometry of inorganic and organic building units to implement molecular ordering and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites. We observe a positive dependence of carrier transport capacity and environmental stability on the molecular regularity in hybrid perovskites. Furthermore, 5&#8208;aminoquinoline lead iodide single crystal with the highest regularity exhibit nearly 5&#8208;fold increased carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product and 20&#8208;fold decreased ionic conductivity along [011] than [100] orientation, enabling a high sensitivity of 8.25&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 under 8&#160;keV X&#8208;ray radiation for radiation detection application. This work sheds light on the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation perovskite&#8208;based semiconductors with enhanced performance and stability for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Promoted C&#9472;C Coupling for Selective Methane Conversion into Ethane on Cerium Oxide Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface hydroxyl modification on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts enhances CH4 chemisorption, reducing the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling and effectively suppressing over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, thereby achieving approximately 97% selectivity over a 200&#8208;h flow operation.








Abstract
Converting methane into high&#8208;value chemicals under mild conditions offers substantial environmental and energy benefits but is challenged by the difficulty of activating C&#9472;H bonds and preventing over&#8208;oxidation. In this study, the pivotal role of hydroxyl&#8208;rich surfaces on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is demonstrated in directing selective C&#9472;C coupling of methane. These surface hydroxyls not only enhance methane chemisorption and improve charge separation, but also promote favorable interactions with molecular oxygen, collectively boosting catalytic performance. Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups lower the energy barrier for ethane formation while suppressing its over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, resulting in significantly improved selectivity. Under ambient conditions in a flow&#8208;reactor system, the catalyst achieves a continuous ethane production rate of 187 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with approximately 97% selectivity over an extended operation period (&gt;200&#160;h), surpassing previous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems. This work provides critical insights into the role of hydroxyl&#8208;modified local environment in methane valorization, paving the way for the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic systems.

         <title>Deconstructive Functionalization of Cyclic Ketones via Electrochemical Interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith (IDB) reaction enables the highly regioselective deconstructive functionalization of cyclic ketones using electricity as the sole oxidant. This strategy transforms complex cyclic ketones into acyclic molecules and has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of planococcol, citrilol acetate, maconelliol, and its derivatives. Mechanistic studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover.








Abstract
Deconstructive functionalization of cyclic molecules has recently emerged as a prominent strategy to access unique architectures that are challenging to prepare through traditional methods. While significant progress has been made in the deconstructive functionalization of cyclic alcohols and amines, the strategies for deconstructing cyclic ketones remain largely unexplored. The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, a ring&#8208;expansion of cyclic ketones, is a powerful method for synthesizing medium&#8208; and large&#8208;ring compounds. Herein, we developed the first interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith (IDB) reaction for highly regioselective deconstructive functionalization of cyclic ketones using electricity as the sole oxidant. This protocol is widely applicable for the deconstruction of small, medium&#8208;sized, and macrocyclic ketones bearing a diverse range of functional groups. Remarkably, various naturally occurring complex cyclic ketones were successfully deconstructed into acyclic molecules, which are difficult to access by known strategies. The method was applied to the asymmetric synthesis of planococcol, citrilol acetate, maconelliol, and its derivatives. Furthermore, the functional groups incorporated during the transformation provided versatile handles for subsequent synthetic modifications. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover followed by deconstructive functionalization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a nitroso&#8208;mediated photochemical strategy under UV irradiation, achieving simultaneous N&#8208;demethylation and aromatic cyclization of N&#8208;methyl amines. The method enables efficient synthesis of functionalized 2H&#8208;indazoles, facilitating the development of drug derivatives and G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;targeting fluorescent probes. Demonstrated biocompatibility and successful cellular imaging applications underscore their potential in therapeutic and diagnostic research.








Abstract
Indazole frameworks are pivotal in medicinal chemistry and fluorescent conjugate design. Herein, we reported a photochemical strategy enabling efficient N&#8208;demethylation and aromatic cyclization of N&#8208;methyl amines via UV&#8208;induced nitroso intermediates, offering an environmentally benign route to structurally diverse 2H&#8208;indazole scaffolds. Diverging from conventional methods, this protocol demonstrates exceptional substrate compatibility with various alkyl/aryl amines, facilitating streamlined assembly of functionalized 2H&#8208;indazole modules. The methodology has been successfully applied to synthesize modified drugs and tumor&#8208;specific fluorescent probes targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes. Preliminary evaluations of physiological toxicity and cellular fluorescence imaging highlight their biomedical potential, establishing these strategies as potential tools for pharmacological development and bioimaging research.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Circular Additive with Multisite Desolvation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fructose (FRU), based on its cyclic molecular framework, directionally assembles a moderate&#8208;thickness EDL at the zinc electrode interface through its nanoscale molecular configuration, quasi&#8208;planar adsorption orientation, and electron delocalization effects. This structure triggers the reconstruction of Zn2+ desolvation pathways via multisite synergistic effects, significantly reducing the desolvation energy barrier, thereby achieving ultrafast interfacial mass transfer kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition behavior.








Abstract
Additive engineering can effectively relieve interface issues of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), but most additives induce the sluggish interface kinetics and boosted polarization, especially at high current density and low temperature. Herein, the relationship between additive molecular structure and desolvation behavior is built by utilizing a series of circular and linear sugar molecules as prototypes, which systematically reveals molecular size, steric configuration, and electronic structure as design criteria for additives to achieve fast desolvation. As indicated by theoretical simulations and experiments, circular fructose (FRU) molecule with small size, quasi&#8208;planar adsorption configuration, and enhanced electron delocalization enables the compact electric double layer (EDL) with shorter Zn2+ diffusion path and lower activation energy via multisite desolvation, thus obtaining the rapid interface kinetics and facilitating highly reversible zinc anode over a wide temperature range. Zn//Zn cell exhibits long cycle life exceeding 9500&#160;h, and Zn//NVO cell maintains 83.92% high&#8208;capacity retention after 2480 cycles under 6.95&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1 lean electrolyte and 11.94&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 high loading.

&lt;p&gt;Fructose (FRU), based on its cyclic molecular framework, directionally assembles a moderate-thickness EDL at the zinc electrode interface through its nanoscale molecular configuration, quasi-planar adsorption orientation, and electron delocalization effects. This structure triggers the reconstruction of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation pathways via multisite synergistic effects, significantly reducing the desolvation energy barrier, thereby achieving ultrafast interfacial mass transfer kinetics and dendrite-free zinc deposition behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transient Supramolecular Polymers by pH&#8208;Gated Conformational Control of a Self&#8208;Assembling Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metastable cyclodextrin monomer can form kinetically trapped supramolecular polymer at low pH. Raising the pH triggers gradual depolymerization into the self&#8208;included monomer with a rate that can be preset by tuning the pH value. The pH&#8208;dependence is directly associated with the rigidity of the cyclodextrin bridge, which is modulated by protonation.








Abstract
Linking a cyclodextrin (CD) host to a hydrophobic guest can result in two distinct conformations: an introverted form (in), in which the guest is self&#8208;included within the CD cavity, and an extraverted form (out), which enables intermolecular interactions and thus the formation of a supramolecular polymer. In this study, we demonstrate that a subtle variation of the linker enables interconversion between these two conformations, the in conformer being thermodynamically the most stable in water. At basic pH (&gt;8) the out conformer is instantly converted into the in. In contrast, at acidic pH (&lt;2), the out monomer can be kinetically trapped and can self&#8208;assemble into a supramolecular polymer. DFT calculations reveal that the interconversion mechanism is governed by a key hydrogen bond that locks the conformational states. Furthermore, we show that pH provides fine kinetic control over the interconversion rate and, consequently, the polymerization process. The system can then be reset toward the out conformation by using DMSO. This system stands in contrast to known transient supramolecular polymerization processes, which rely on metastable (non&#8208;assembled) monomers. Here, it is the kinetic trapping of the assembling monomer that allows control over the lifetime of the transient supramolecular polymer via a pH&#8208;responsive mechanism.

         <title>Imine Reductase&#8211;Catalyzed Remote Stereocontrol for Enantiodivergent Synthesis of Cyclohexylidene&#8208;Based Axially Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic route for the enantiodivergent synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines was developed. This method features imine reductase catalyzed remote stereocontrol in establishing the unusual axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond, providing both enantiomers of chiral products in high yield with high enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines exhibit unique axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond and have shown great potential in medicinal chemistry. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging due to the long distance between the chirally relevant groups. Herein, we report a highly efficient and asymmetric synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines from 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones and primary amines catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs). Enantiodivergent IREDs were identified to provide convenient access to both enantiomers of chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, 99:1 or 1:99 enantiomeric ratio). A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines was also achieved. Moreover, protein X&#8208;ray crystallography and molecular modeling studies were conducted to provide structural insight into the remote stereocontrol of IREDs in generating cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axial chirality.

         <title>Switchable Regiodivergent Reductive Alkyl&#8211;Alkyl Coupling by Nickel Catalysis: Sorting Different Alkyl&#8211;Nickel Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;divergent reductive alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling between two different migratory alkyl halides has been developed. The reaction proceeds via tunable non&#8208;migratory or site&#8208;defined migratory alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature, providing a straightforward protocol for the alkylation of unactivated Csp3&#9472;H bonds by differentiating thermodynamic and non&#8208;thermodynamic alkyl intermediates to deliver three types of branched N&#8208;acyl amine architectures from identical starting materials.








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective and divergent functionalizations on saturated alkyl chain at specific unfunctionalized positions is a key challenge in organic chemistry and other related areas and offers unprecedented synthetic opportunities. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective and divergent alkyl&#8211;alkyl reductive coupling between two different alkyl halides has been developed. Notably, the reaction finely tunes and recognizes thermodynamic favored &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals over &#946;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, and distal ipso&#8208;alkyl radicals to deliver chemo&#8208; and position&#8208;selective alkylation of unactivated &#945;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;H of amines under reductive conditions. Moreover, the reaction selectively functionalizes one alkyl chain over two migratable alkyl chains. By just switching the catalytic parameters, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of saturated C&#9472;H bonds, and ipso&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling allow for rapid access to three types of branched aliphatic amine architectures from identical starting materials.

         <title>Homogenized Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rigid SAM (PhPAPy), designed to leverage the structural tunability of SAMs for achieving uniform substrate coverage with a single molecule. The high&#8208;quality HTL based on PhPAPy effectively minimizes direct perovskite&#8211;electrode contact, reduces defect density, and suppresses nonradiative recombination at the buried interface. The champion device achieved a certified reverse&#8208;scan PCE of 26.74% while maintaining T95&#160;=&#160;2000&#160;h long&#8208;term stability (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly improved, driven by advancements in self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs). However, achieving homogeneous SAM coverage on substrates remains challenging, directly impacting device performance and stability. Here, we present (4&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (PhPAPy), a SAM with a rigid aromatic ring structure. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that this rigidity limits rotational freedom, promoting a near&#8208;vertical molecular orientation on the substrate. Additionally, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the planar pyrene rings enhance molecular packing, forming a homogeneous and dense SAM layer. As a result, the uniform PhPAPy effectively minimizes perovskite&#8211;substrate direct contact, enhances the interfacial properties, reduces buried interface defects, and improves both efficiency and stability. With PhPAPy SAM, the assembled inverted PSCs achieve a certified reverse&#8208;scanning power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.74% and a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 26.12% (from National Institute of Metrology in China). These devices retain 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C and ambient humidity (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Harnessing Solvation Chemistry of Pentavalent Vanadium for Wide&#8208;Temperature Range Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level investigation of V(V) solvation transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3 via a four&#8208;step mechanism is presented, with the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. This insight enables V(V) stabilization via proton and anion coordination, and a mixed&#8208;acid electrolyte was developed with exceptional stability at 50&#160;&#176;C for VFB.








Abstract
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable solutions for storing renewable energies. However, the poor thermal stability of pentavalent vanadium [V(V)] electrolyte, manifested as V2O5 precipitation at high temperatures, leads to more critical heat management, low energy density, and even low reliability. The unclear dynamic solvation chemistry of V(V) ions brings difficulties in solving the above issues intrinsically. Herein, we investigated solvation structures and dynamic evolution of V(V) electrolyte using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). For the first time, we clarified the transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3, identifying the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. Based on this, we developed stabilization strategies through anion coordination and proton concentration control. The incorporation of HCl and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid improved the thermal stability of V(V) electrolytes remarkably. The optimized electrolyte showed no precipitation during 30&#8208;day static tests at 50 &#176;C, enabling stable cycling performance of 3000 cycles in VFB single cells. Further demonstration in a kW&#8208;scale stack achieved over 1000 cycles, validating the scalability and viability. Our work provides insights into the solvation chemistry of V(V) species, paving the way to improve the reliability and energy density of a VFB system.

         <title>Decavanadate&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling: an Efficient and Sustainable Approach toward P(O)&#9472;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A decavanadate&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of P(O)&#9472;H compounds with thiols is presented. The reaction can proceed efficiently without any assistance of heat, light, electricity, or unfriendly additives and is amenable to gram&#8208;scale and sustainable synthesis. This study not only offers a practical and green strategy for P(O)&#9472;S bond formation but also highlights the catalytic potential of decavanadate anion in organic transformation.








Abstract
A convenient green protocol has been developed for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between thiols and P(O)&#8722;H compounds using decavanadate anion as the catalyst at room temperature under open&#8208;flask conditions. The reaction proceeds efficiently in water or ethanol without any assistance of heat, light, electricity, or unfriendly additives and tolerates a broad spectrum of functional groups, delivering the desired products in up to 95% yield. Importantly, the decavanadate catalyst can be easily recycled in gram&#8208;scale synthesis at least six times without a significant decline in reaction yield. Further, mechanistic investigations evidence the formation of tetravalent vanadium&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;species in the reaction process and reveal that the P(O)&#8722;S dehydrogenative coupling is enabled via a VV to VIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Deuterating Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Semiconductors for Sensitive Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuteration strategy is employed to universally suppress nonradiative decay pathways in narrow&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors. Compared to their protonated counterparts, deuterated molecules exhibit lower stretching vibrational frequencies, enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency, and reduced photogenerated carrier recombination, thereby improving the responsivity and specific detectivity of short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors exhibit significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies owing to their structural tunability and solution processability; nevertheless, as their bandgap decreases, the nonradiative recombination for either exciton or photogenerated charge&#8208;carriers increases, limiting short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photoresponse, as governed by energy gap law. Here, a deuteration strategy is employed to universally reduce the nonradiative decay pathways of SWIR organic semiconductors, enhancing photodetector sensitivity. Compared to protonated L4, the rational deuterated molecule (BT&#8208;12D) maintains SWIR photoresponse to &#8764;1.7&#160;&#181;m and exhibits lower stretching vibrational frequency (2350&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;vs. 3063&#160;cm&#8722;1), resulting in reduced recombination and 40% increase in specific detectivity (D*) at 1.3&#160;&#181;m for PDPPDTP: BT&#8208;12D&#8208;based organic photodetectors (OPDs). Likewise, deuterated L2&#8208;eC9&#8208;10D&#8208;based OPDs blending with PTB7&#8208;Th exhibit 14% higher D* (1.24&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 1.2&#160;&#181;m) and faster rise/fall time (1.0/1.2&#160;&#181;s) than protonated devices (1.09&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones; 1.6/1.7&#160;&#181;s). The optimized D* of deuterated OPDs is comparable to and even better than those of commercial detectors at 0.9&#8211;1.2&#160;&#181;m, while the corresponding response time is the fastest value reported for SWIR OPDs. These results highlight the broad applicability of deuteration as an effective strategy to suppress nonradiative decay pathways in SWIR organic semiconductors, unlocking new opportunities for sensitive SWIR optoelectronics.

         <title>Dynamic Migration&#8208;Pulling Polymer Electrolyte Design Strategy for Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic migration&#8208;pulling strategy is proposed through boronic ester&#8208;functionalized gel polymer electrolytes (BE&#8208;GPE) to reconfigure Li+ solvation structures. By leveraging dynamic covalent bonds, polar side chains actively detach from coordination shells during ion transport, significantly lowering desolvation energy barriers. Combined with suppressed polysulfide shuttling and stabilized lithium deposition, the BE&#8208;GPE enables high&#8208;efficiency sulfur redox kinetics and robust low&#8208;temperature operation in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, advancing adaptive electrolyte design for energy storage systems.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries exhibit significant promise as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology, yet their performance remains constrained by polysulfide accumulation and exacerbated shuttle effects due to sluggish redox kinetics and inefficient charge transport. Here, a dynamic migration&#8208;pulling strategy is proposed to accelerate polysulfide redox kinetics by dynamically restructuring the solvated structure of Li+, which is validated on a GPE incorporating boronic ester dynamic covalent bonds and polar side chains (BE&#8208;GPE). Theoretical calculations and experiments revealed that the desolvation barrier for Li+ is significantly reduced, while the ligand groups were pulled out from the solvated shell assisted by the migration of dynamic covalent bonds. Rapid charge transfer kinetics are attainable via designed electrolyte. Consequently, BE&#8208;GPE based lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries delivered high reversible capacity of 1446&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C and long&#8208;term cycling stability with an average capacity decay of 0.04% during 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;C. The initial capacity at 0.5&#160;C is up to 920&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and remains stable for 200 cycles at 0&#160;&#176;C. Successfully realized the energy storage of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries under low&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Selective Crosslinking of Primary and Secondary Alkyl Amines with CS2 Under Ambient Aerobic Oxidation for Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Umpolung of primary amines via isothiocyanation presents an attractive approach for crosslinking biorelevant molecules through two nucleophilic handles. However, conventional isothiocyanation reactions typically require highly electrophilic reagents or strongly oxidative conditions, rendering them unsuitable for complex molecular systems. Herein, we present a robust and non&#8208;chemist&#8208;friendly protocol for the isothiocyanation of primary alkyl amines using CS2 under ambient aerobic oxidation conditions, eliminating the need for additional promoters. These mild conditions not only ensure broad compatibility with endogenous functional groups in biorelevant molecules but also unlock a powerful new capability: selective differentiation between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Notably, the unique suppression of homo&#8208;linking for both primary and secondary amines under these conditions enables near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selectivity in cross&#8208;linking two different biorelevant molecules via their abundant amino handles in a one&#8208;pot operation, offering a streamlined, thiol&#8208;independent, and small&#8208;footprint approach to biocompatible conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoting Targeted Delivery of Epigenetic Immunostimulants to Activate Breast Cancer Immunity via HDACs Downregulation and PD&#8208;L1 Upregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive phenotype of breast cancer significantly limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This study reveals that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are upregulated in breast cancer, while lower levels of HDACs and higher levels of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) are associated with better patient prognosis. Moreover, Trichostatin A (TSA) is confirmed to suppress HDACs and increase PD&#8208;L1 expression. Building on these insights, a self&#8208;promoting targeted immunostimulant (SPT&#8208;IS) is developed to activate breast cancer immunity by epigenetically upregulating PD&#8208;L1. SPT&#8208;IS can selectively accumulate in PD&#8208;L1&#8208;overexpressing breast cancer cells for co&#8208;delivery of Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and TSA. Notably, SPT&#8208;IS&#8208;induced epigenetic upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 creates a self&#8208;promoting tumor&#8208;targeting loop that enhances drug delivery efficiency. Besides, SPT&#8208;IS generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cells and release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, increasing tumor immunogenicity. Additionally, the epigenetic regulation ability of SPT&#8208;IS upregulates immunomodulatory cytokines and stimulates T cell cytotoxicity for immune activation. Immunological results confirm robust immunomodulatory effects of SPT&#8208;IS, significantly enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes recruitment and proliferation, leading to notable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of a self&#8208;promoting targeted strategy to enhance drug delivery and provide an epigenetic approach to boost the immune response against breast cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene Protected Superatomic Ag8 Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise monolayer&#8208;protected coinage metal nanoclusters (CMNCs) have drawn increasing attention for their diverse structures and intriguing properties. Nevertheless, no all N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene (NHC)&#8208;protected atomically precise silver nanoclusters have been synthesized yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of the first all&#8208;NHC&#8208;protected superatomic silver cluster. This NHC&#8208;ligand&#8208;stabilized Ag8 cluster, characterized as Ag8K2L4(CO3)2(PF6)6 was prepared by reacting Ag2O with bisimidazolium salt H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 under alkaline conditions in dimethylformamide via a one&#8208;pot reaction. The results of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and high&#8208;resolution electrospray&#8208;ionization (HR&#8208;ESI) mass spectrometry revealed a cluster centered with a stable Ag8 ring. Energy decomposition analysis combined with the natural orbital for chemical valence method (EDA&#8208;NOCV) was employed to analyze the nature of the Ag&#8211;ligand bonding, and the results suggested that the stabilization energy originated from the strong electrostatic attraction of the Ag8 ring to the NHC ligand. This work is expected to enable new applications of various NHC ligands in the formation of NHC&#8208;protected metal clusters with attractive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Robust Hydrophilic&#8208;Hydrophobic Interface via &#960;&#8208;electron Delocalization for Ultralong&#8208;Lived Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are hindered by the severe interfacial issues of Zn anode such as side reactions and dendrite growth. The in&#8208;situ construction of robust interface to tackle above issues remains a grand challenge and lacks rational design principles, especially under high current density. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization strategy is proposed to in&#8208;situ construct the self&#8208;assembled hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interface layer (HHIL) for ultralong&#8208;lived AZIBs, where interface design principles are built based on the electronic structure and spatial configuration of additives. Encouragingly, HHIL derived by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and ion&#8208;dipole interactions is robust during long&#8208;term cycling and facilitates the generation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interface chemistry. The flexible HHIL and rigid inorganic&#8208;rich interface afford the rapid interface kinetics, and effectively suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. Notably, Zn//Zn cells deliver the cycling life over 900 hours at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8208;2, and Zn//NVO full cells stably perform over 25,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1. Furthermore, the practical pouch cell is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation in a Thermally Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxoniobate Framework Boosts Lithium Ion Battery Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Niobium oxides are considered as promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their excellent rate&#8208;performance. However, the practical application is hindered by their limited specific capacity. In this work, we report the first example of an all&#8208;inorganic two&#8208;dimensional niobate framework as anode material for LIBs. The title compound is based on antimony&#8208;linked bivanadyl&#8208;capped &#945;&#8208;Keggin polyoxoniobates as secondary building units. The compound undergoes a unique single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation triggered by formic acid which results in the migration of a {VO} unit into the framework interlayer. This results in a 34% increase of the specific capacity, reaching 519 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, thereby surpassing most Nb&#8208;based LIB anode materials. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the SCSC transformation exposes more Li&#8208;binding sites in the framework, and reduces the interlayer Li&#8208;ion diffusion barrier, leading to a capacity increase. This work presents the first example of a SCSC transformation leading to enhanced LIB performance and offers atomic&#8208;level insights into the design of advanced LIB anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;healing Indium Sulfide Catalyst for Efficient and Robust Electrocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction&#8208;reconstruction of the catalyst under negative bias has been identified as a significant rationale underlying the performance degradation of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Screening catalysts with stable phases and robust crystal structures appears to be a feasible approach to counteract the reduction corrosion. In this work, with the guidance of computational predictions, a tetragonal phase In2S3 electrocatalyst is designed through a self&#8208;healing strategy for the conversion of CO2 to formate. Remarkably, In2S3 exhibits superior stability for over 200 h at a current density of ~210 mA cm&#8722;2, with a persistent formate Faradaic efficiency of ~97%. A series of in situ spectroscopic measurements confirm that In2S3 maintains the structural and valence state integrity throughout the reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, the performance enhancement mechanism and self&#8208;healing principle of In2S3 are clearly elucidated. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Accurate nucleic acid quantification analysis (NQA) is crucial for disease treatment and prevention. However, existing digital NQA methods often lack sufficient automation and speed. In this study, we introduce a novel rapid and automated active&#8208;matrix digital microfluidics&#8208;based droplet digital recombinase polymerase amplification method (AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA). This method can quantify influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) within a mere 60 minutes, covering the entire workflow from nucleic acid extraction to digital amplification, fluorescence detection, and statistical analysis. We fabricated an AM&#8208;DMF chip equipped with high&#8208;throughput electrodes and optimized its control logic. Leveraging an artificial intelligence droplet navigation algorithm, we successfully achieved motion and mixing operations of high&#8208;throughput droplets (4608 droplets, each with a volume of 0.9 nL). A dual&#8208;target RPA system was designed to detect IAV and IBV, and its detection performance was fine&#8208;tuned. Experiments conducted with clinical samples revealed that this method exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity for single&#8208;molecule detection, with a detection limit of 1.69 copies per reaction, and it achieved 100% concordance with qPCR results. This groundbreaking quantification technology holds tremendous promise for advancing disease diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental research.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Fluorinated Aromatic Molecule&#8208;based Radiofrequency Identification Tags Enabled by Stepwise Tuning of Nuclear Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the Internet of Things (IoT) network, radiofrequency identification (RFID) is a key enabler for wireless communication, facilitating real&#8208;time monitoring and control. A primary goal of enhancing IoT infrastructure is the development of versatile RFID tags that are of compact size, high capacity, and robust security with seamless read&#8208;write operations. Here, we report a fluorine&#8208;19 nuclear magnetic resonance (19F NMR) based molecular encoding strategy using a fluorinated aromatics (FArs) library, termed "FArsEER" (Fluorinated Aromatics&#8208;Empowered Encoding and Reading), to generate small molecule&#8208;based ID tags (Farcodes). By leveraging the structure&#8208;sensitive nature of 19F chemical shift, we developed a stepwise tuning strategy to precisely modulate 19F chemical shift via nuclear shielding. Through a simple one&#8208;step synthesis, we constructed a demonstrating platform of 64 FArs with distinct 19F chemical shifts, enabling the quick generation of binary Farcodes capable of 64&#8208;bit encoding and their facile reading and decoding with 19F NMR. Moreover, by leveraging the solvent&#8208;dependent 19F chemical shifts and hydrolysis&#8208;sensitive property, reversible encryption and irreversible erasure were further achieved with Farcodes for information security applications. With further advancements, Farcodes may serve as a promising small molecule&#8208;based RFID tag for secure information storage and communication in IoT networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Bilateral Functions Enable&#160;Working Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries at &#8722;60&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish interfacial reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases seriously hinder the practical applications of sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with extremely lowtemperature performance. Here, we propose an ester&#8208;based electrolyte featuring solvent&#8208;anion synergistic and self&#8208;purification function, that empowers SMBs to operate stably at record&#8208;low temperatures down to &#8722;60&#176;C. The weakly solvating fluorinated solvent (ethyl difluoroacetate, EDFA) constructs an anion&#8208;dominated solvated structure, where the high&#8208;donor&#8208;number trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) synergistically reduces Na+ desolvation energy barrier while triggering the defluorination of EDFA. This dynamic process insitu generates inorganic components (e.g., NaF) in solid electrolyte interphase. Further, tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TMSPi) additive effectively scavenges corrosive HF species through self&#8208;purification mechanism, ensuring durable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. As a result, the ester&#8208;based SMBs render a capacity retention of 96% at &#8722;40&#176;C (relative to the room&#8208;temperature capacity), exceptional rate capacity (81.64 mAh g&#8722;1 at 400 mA g&#8722;1 with 70.26% retention at &#8722;40&#176;C, which is the best rate capability at extremely low temperature compared to other ester&#8208;based SMBs), and extended cycle ability (&gt;300 cycles at &#8722;40&#176;C and 100 cycles at &#8722;60&#176;C). This work establishes a new paradigm for developing esterbased electrolytes to address the extreme&#8208;temperature operation challenges of SMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes Stimulating Immunogenic Pyroptosis as Burgeoning Antitumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of antitumor agents with diverse action mechanisms has become an important focus in both fundamental research and clinical oncology, driven by the need for more effective cancer therapies. Metal complexes, with their versatile chemical, photophysical and biological properties, represent an ideal class of therapeutic and diagnostic candidates for investigating novel antitumor mechanisms. Recent advances have underscored their unique ability to trigger diverse cell death pathways. Among these, pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has garnered substantial attention because of its intrinsic link to antitumor immunity. This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis and elucidates their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities. By dissecting the interplay among pyroptosis induction, biological processes such as inflammasome activation and gasdermin cleavage, and subsequent immune reprogramming, we provide a thorough overview of the action mechanisms of metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducers. This understanding has inspired the rational development of novel anticancer metal complexes that can remodel the tumor microenvironment and synergize with immunotherapies.</dc:description>

A new ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) was synthesized by combining &#960;&#8208;bridge and charge&#8208;introduction strategy via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction. The &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;linked ionic liquid endow iQCOF enhanced charge transfer ability, fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and higher reaction rate. Thereby, it can be regarded as advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with rapid kinetics to achieve&#160;high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their well&#8208;defined topologies and tunable pore architectures. However, their practical application is often limited by intrinsically sluggish charge transfer and inferior reaction kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) cathode via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction with triazole ionic liquid. The iQCOF architecture achieves a synergistic enhancement by integrating &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;induced charge delocalization to facilitate charge transport, the specific adsorption effect to gain fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and polar triazine units to enable uniform ion flux for stable interfaces. As a result, iQCOF delivers a high specific capacity of 407 mAh g&#8722;1 with 701&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, and exceptional rate capability (121 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1) with 0.0027% per cycle over 10&#160;000 cycles, further highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;performance organic cathode. This work provides a convenient strategy for advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with fast reaction kinetics to achieve high&#8208;rate performance, paving the way for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Antimicrobial Based on Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte and Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of supramolecular antimicrobials was developed by forming host&#8208;guest inclusion complexes between conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) and cyclodextrins. This supramolecular strategy enhanced COEs' biocompatibility without sacrificing antimicrobial efficacy, offering a new antibiotic design platform to address the typical trade&#8208;off between efficacy and selectivity in amphiphilic antimicrobials and combat antimicrobial resistance.








Abstract
The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we prepared a resveratrol&#8208;derived antimicrobial conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) named DY6 to enhance drug&#8208;like properties. While DY6&#8217;s increased hydrophobicity augmented its antibacterial efficacy, it also induced significant cytotoxicity, highlighting the long&#8208;existing dilemma of amphiphilic antimicrobials. To mitigate this issue, we employed a supramolecular strategy by complexing DY6 with sodium sulfobutyl ether &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (S&#946;CD), forming the host&#8211;guest inclusion complex DY6@S&#946;CD. This complex elevated the half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against L929 cells from 9.4 to over 128&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 while maintaining a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). NMR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic analyses confirmed that DY6&#8217;s aromatic backbone is encapsulated within the hydrophobic cavity of S&#946;CD. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that size compatibility and electrostatic interactions are essential for stable complex formation and enhanced biocompatibility.

     alt="Host&#8211;Guest Antimicrobial Based on Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte and Cyclodextrin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new class of supramolecular antimicrobials was developed by forming host-guest inclusion complexes between conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) and cyclodextrins. This supramolecular strategy enhanced COEs' biocompatibility without sacrificing antimicrobial efficacy, offering a new antibiotic design platform to address the typical trade-off between efficacy and selectivity in amphiphilic antimicrobials and combat antimicrobial resistance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we prepared a resveratrol-derived antimicrobial conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) named &lt;b&gt;DY6&lt;/b&gt; to enhance drug-like properties. While &lt;b&gt;DY6&lt;/b&gt;&#8217;s increased hydrophobicity augmented its antibacterial efficacy, it also induced significant cytotoxicity, highlighting the long-existing dilemma of amphiphilic antimicrobials. To mitigate this issue, we employed a supramolecular strategy by complexing &lt;b&gt;DY6&lt;/b&gt; with sodium sulfobutyl ether &#946;-cyclodextrin (&lt;b&gt;S&#946;CD&lt;/b&gt;), forming the host&#8211;guest inclusion complex &lt;b&gt;DY6@S&#946;CD&lt;/b&gt;. This complex elevated the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) against L929 cells from 9.4 to over 128&#160;&#181;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while maintaining a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2&#160;&#181;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA). NMR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic analyses confirmed that &lt;b&gt;DY6&lt;/b&gt;&#8217;s aromatic backbone is encapsulated within the hydrophobic cavity of &lt;b&gt;S&#946;CD&lt;/b&gt;. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that size compatibility and electrostatic interactions are essential for stable complex formation and enhanced biocompatibility. Importantly, &lt;b&gt;DY6@S&#946;CD&lt;/b&gt; exhibited no resistance development over 14-day serial passages against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, significantly outperforming norfloxacin. In biofilm-based MRSA-infected wound and corneal models, &lt;b&gt;DY6@S&#946;CD&lt;/b&gt; more effectively reduced bacterial load and inflammation compared to the last-resort antibiotic vancomycin. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of supramolecular host&#8211;guest approach based on COEs to overcome the drug-resistant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective C2 Electroproduction via Back Bonding in Asymmetric Copper&#8208;Copper Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs were engineered through the in situ isostructural substitution method on F&#8208;Cu3N substrates. Unlike the isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bonding between CuN and the *C1 intermediate, CuF establishes an additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding interaction. This synergy induces a charge&#8208;polarized 2*CHO adsorption configuration, concurrently enhancing coupling kinetics and C2 selectivity through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions.








Abstract
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered a highly attractive approach to reduce carbon emissions and yet encounters challenges in further converting *C1 intermediates to valuable two&#8208;carbon (C2) products. Although copper&#8208;based catalysts exhibit satisfactory adsorption energy for *C1 species, the symmetrical charge distribution at adjacent copper sites leads to a strong repulsive force between adsorbed *C1. Herein, asymmetric copper&#8208;copper (CuF&#8208;CuN) motifs with distinct adsorption behaviors have been constructed on the F&#8208;Cu3N substrate using the in situ isostructural substitution method. Compared to the high hybridization of CuN 3d and N 2p orbitals, implanted F not only reduces the hybridization strength but also endows the CuF with delocalized unpaired electrons. Accordingly, CuF, beyond forming an isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bond between Cu and the key *C1 intermediate (*CHO), offers additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding to the *CHO. With dipole interactions in the asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs, the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent *CHO is diminished, efficiently promoting the C&#8208;C coupling in CO2RR. Therefore, the CuF&#8208;CuN motifs achieve an exceptional C2 selectivity of 81.5% with a partial current density of &#8722;325.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a C2/C1 selectivity ratio of 10.47. This nuanced manipulation of atomic interactions illuminates a path to potentially groundbreaking alterations in material characteristics.

         <title>Development of an Organoautocatalyzed Double &#963;&#8208;Bond C(sp2)&#8208;N Transamination Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of cyclic tertiary amines is disclosed as a high&#8208;yielding, scalable reaction that proceeds under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions. It operates via a multi&#8208;step domino reaction mechanism, where an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt functions as a HBD organoautocatalyst. The reaction opens the door for the efficient synthesis of novel N&#8208;substituted DNDHPs of interest in both life and materials sciences.








Abstract
The transamination reaction, which involves the conversion of one amine to another, traditionally relies on biological enzyme catalysts. Although chemists have recently developed a few transition metal&#8208;catalyzed methods, mimicking these enzymes to interconvert amine groups in acyclic substrates via transamination metathesis of a single C(sp2)&#9472;N bond, transamination of cyclic tertiary amines has remained a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we present the development of organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of two C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds in a cyclic substrate that allows for the challenging transformation to take place with up to 95% yield under exceptionally mild reaction conditions at room temperature without external catalysts and/or additives. The reaction mechanism has been studied in detail through time&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;NMR, 2D NMR, and computational methods. Remarkably, in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt acts as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) organoautocatalyst in this multi&#8208;step domino process. The new organoautocatalyzed methodology gives environmentally friendly, atom&#8208;economical, straightforward, and rapid access to N&#8208;substituted 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DNDHPs), thus offering facile entry to privileged bioactive compounds.

         <title>Helicenes with Four Helical Turns: Dimerization of [13]Helicenes to [27]Helicenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The telephone cord challenge: When a 2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;annulated hetero[13]helicene is oxidatively dimerized, two structurally distinct hetero[27]helicenes (both with four helical turns) are formed. When a racemic mixture of [13]helicenes is dimerized, a (M)&#8208; and a (P)&#8208;helicene join to form a mixed [27]helicenoid (right), and when an enantiomerically pure [13]helicene is dimerized an unusual bis&#8208;keto form of the naphthol units is formed (left).








Abstract
The promise of enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from organic molecules has inspired synthetic efforts to prepare elongated multi&#8208;layer helicenes. It has proven particularly challenging to synthesize and isolate enantiomerically pure multi&#8208;turn helicenes, and consequently, clear guidelines for the molecular design of helicenes to achieve large CPL output remain elusive. We explore the oxidative dimerization of a 2&#8208;naphthol&#8208;annulated hetero[13]helicene, and observe the formation of two types of structurally distinct hetero[27]helicenes, both with four helical turns, form. With CuIICl(OH)&#8208;TMEDA as the oxidant, a symmetric dimer (bi[13]) formed, joining two helicenes with the same helicity in their keto tautomeric forms. Using CuII(OTf)&#8322; as the oxidant led to an unsymmetrical [27]helicenoid composed by an (M)&#8208; and a (P)&#8208;enantiomer of the [13]helicene through an unusual coupling between the 1&#8208; and 3&#8208;positions of the 2&#8208;naphthol units. Structural characterization was achieved by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal (X&#8208;ray or electron) diffraction analysis. The enantiomers of this [27]helicenoid were analyzed by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL measurements. The spectroscopic data were corroborated by DFT calculations, and the intense CPL output is preserved despite the presence of an (M)&#8208; and a (P)&#8208;helicene in the same molecule. These [27]helicenoids are the first isolated structures that feature helical &#960;&#8208;systems with four helical turns.

         <dc:description>
This work describes a new anionic supramolecular polymer based on a high&#8208;affinity macrocycle&#8211;anion recognition between tetraurea macrocycle and organophosphate anions and its application in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with excellent performance. The findings presented here may pave the way for the design of new supramolecular polyanions and their unique applications in energy devices.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) driven by host&#8211;guest interactions have seen considerable advancements over the past decade, but the guest species involved are predominantly neutral molecules or cations. Strong and dependable macrocycle&#8211;anion interactions for supramolecular polymerization are highly sought after, yet the functionalities of this class of SPs featuring negatively charged backbones remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel host&#8211;guest interaction between one tetraurea macrocycle and two organophosphate anions with high affinity (association constant Ka&#160;=&#160;1.06&#160;&#215;&#160;109 M&#8722;2). It can serve as noncovalent joints to efficiently link low&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass polyethylene oxide (PEO) diorganophosphates into long linear SPs. Being used as an interphase layer in anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries, the polymer material promotes Li+ absorption and desolvation through electrostatic attractions and enables fast Li+ transport by the alternatingly arranged anionic linkages and PEO units in the polymer main chain. As a result, the SP layer homogenizes Li+ flux to achieve uniform Li deposition and significantly improves the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 full batteries by a factor of 285% with cycling stability over 200 cycles. These findings pave the way for a new family of anion&#8208;based SPs with tunable architectures and compositions and suggest their promising applications in future batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Precision in Biomass Conversion Through Functional Ligand Engineering of Lewis Acidic MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a strategic combination of sulfo&#8208;functionalized ligands and terephthalic acid, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;based catalysts with tunable Lewis acidity were synthesized, where the specific chemical state of each sulfo group served as a critical regulator of catalytic activity in glucose isomerization. This precise control enabled unambiguous correlation between acid site characteristics and reaction performance.








Abstract
Glucose isomerization to fructose is a key factor in cellulosic biomass utilization. Thus, achieving highly efficient fructose production and understanding the dominant reaction route remain crucial goals. Hereby, this study refines a precise ligand engineering strategy applied to the typical metal&#8211;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66, generating a series of Lewis acidic UiO&#8208;66&#8208;based catalysts with only subtle structural adjustments. Among all, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;pCl&#8208;SBA possessed the strongest Lewis acidity and the best glucose isomerization performance. Further investigation elaborates the crucial contribution of both Lewis acid amount and specific acid nature to enhanced catalytic reactivity, given a high fructose yield of 47% at glucose conversion of 63%, achieved with a UiO&#8208;66&#8208;STPA(49%). The increased acid density with specific Lewis acid strength is computationally identified to promote glucose polarization, facilitating the isomerization process. Density functional theory calculations reveal that incorporating functionalized ligands and increasing their proportion markedly decrease both the electron density at Zr sites and the material's band gap, which in turn benefits the Lewis acid strength and catalytic activity enhancement. This work highlights the significance of Lewis sites&#8217; nature and its effect on glucose isomerization performance.

         <title>Promoting Alkane Binding: Crystallization of a Cationic Manganese(I)&#8208;Pentane &#963;&#8208;Complex from Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation of Mn&#8322;(CO)&#8321;&#8320; under pseudo gas&#8208;phase conditions generates the weakly coordinated 16 valence electron complex [Mn(CO)&#8325;]&#8314;, which binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest ligand available in this system. Three isomers were characterized by low&#8208;temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers is a new route to generate reactive metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes are key intermediates in C&#8211;H activation and, until now, analysis of these species has been restricted to either the solution OR the solid state. Here we present a synthetic methodology that converts Mn2(CO)10 in a noncoordinating solvent environment to [Mn(CO)5]+ at room temperature, and this species binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest interacting ligand available. Three isomers of the n&#8208;pentane &#963;&#8208;complexes were studied in detail by solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy at low temperature. Two isomers of [Mn(CO)5(n&#8208;pentane)]+ crystallize from solution at room temperature and their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers in solution to generate reactive metal cations, which bind alkanes as the strongest available ligand, is a new and probably general approach to generate metal&#8208;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes.

         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the indirect and direct electrosynthesis of NH2OH. The outlook of performance improvement strategies including catalysts and reactor design is also provided. 








Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) serves as an important industrial feedstock. The conventional production and transportation of NH2OH requires harsh conditions. Recently, electrochemical hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing oxidative species, such as nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide (NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722;/NO), into NH2OH has been developed as a sustainable strategy. However, the over&#8208;hydrogenation product of ammonia is preferentially obtained under electroreduction condition. Thus, the rational design of catalysts structure is crucial to selective electrosynthesis of NH2OH. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH with emphasis on the design of catalysts structure. Electrochemical synthesis strategy we discussed is categorized by the existence form of product, including indirect electrosynthesis and direct electrosynthesis. Finally, the techno&#8211;economic analysis (TEA) of electrochemical NH2OH production and outlook of performance improvement strategies are carried out to further guide the optimization of reaction system.

         <title>Enantioselective Immobilization of Nonprecious Metal Complexes on Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Improved Single&#8208;Site Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective immobilization of chiral Co(salen) complexes on the surface of chiral &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs enables axial coordination of Co(II) centers with COF linkages, which tautomerize from keto&#8208;enamine to enol&#8208;imine upon binding. This enantiomeric assembly enhances Co(II) reducibility and allows for inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer, leading to remarkable photocatalytic H&#8322; evolution without additional precious metals.








Abstract
The noncovalent assembly of molecular catalysts into photocatalytic systems represents a pivotal strategy for exploring single&#8208;site heterogenous catalysts, excluding the need for elaborate functionalization design. However, the reliance on weak noncovalent interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces) often leads to inefficient outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer and inferior structural stability. Herein, we report the enantioselective immobilization of cobalt&#8208;based molecular catalysts with chiral tetradentate ligands onto the surface of a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic framework (COF) synthesized through chirality induction. The enantiomeric assembly enables axial coordination between the molecular catalysts and the chiral COF, accompanied by enamine&#8208;to&#8208;imine tautomerization. Leveraging efficient inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer, the resulting composite exhibits a significantly enhanced H2 evolution rate (5.70&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and sustained performance without the use of precious metals. The enantiomeric assembly strategy on a COF platform demonstrates a viable approach to improve both the stability and activity of molecular catalysts, thereby expanding the design paradigm of single&#8208;site photocatalysts.

         <title>A Thorough Characterization of the Tellurocyanate Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tellurocyanate, [TeCN]&#8722;, is the heaviest group 16 congener of the cyanate anion, [OCN]&#8722;. Due to the relative instability of the C&#8211;Te bond, tellurocyanate chemistry has seen only scarce attention. Here, we present the facile synthesis and thorough characterization of [K@crypt&#8208;222][TeCN]. The anion is essentially linear with interatomic distances of C&#8211;N = 1.150(6) &#197; and C&#8211;Te = 2.051(4) &#197;, thus approximating a C&#8801;N triple bond and for C&#8211;Te a bond order between 1 and 2. Fully 13C and 15N labelled [Te13C15N]&#8722; allowed for the extraction of chemical shifts and all possible coupling constants (13C = 77.8 ppm, 15N = 285.7 ppm, 125Te = &#8722;566 ppm, 1J13C15N = 8 Hz, 1J13C125Te = 748 Hz, 2J15N125Te = 55 Hz), which were also determined independently by quantum chemical calculations. In the series [ChCN]&#8722; (Ch = O&#8211;Te) [TeCN]&#8722; shows the strongest spin&#8208;orbit coupling induced heavy&#8208;atom effect on the light&#8208;atom shielding (SO&#8208;HALA&#8208;effect). In contrast 15N shifts are well described also without considering relativistic effects and/or SOC. Negative&#8208;ion photoelectron spectroscopy was used to extract the electron affinity (EA = 3.034 eV) and spin&#8208;orbit splitting (3807 cm&#8722;1) of [TeCN]&#8226;. These values continue the trends of falling EA and rising SOC in the series [ChCN]&#8226;.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the mRNA Vaccine Building Block N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Triphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and the N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are critical monomer building blocks of the currently used mRNA vaccines, yet efficient methods of their synthesis from readily accessible substrates remain underdeveloped. We herein report notably atom&#8208;economic and high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route toward &#936;TP (83% yield) and present two chemo&#8208;enzymatic routes for producing m1&#936;TP at &#8764;200 mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivers &#936;MP (&#8764;320 mg/mL) or &#936; (&#8764;240 mg/mL) in 95% yield each. The acetonide&#8208;protected &#936;MP is N1&#8208;methylated selectively using dimethyl sulfate (4 eq, 85% yield) and is subsequently converted to the triphosphate (7.3 mg/mL; 83% yield) by kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate kinase is shown for ATP&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of (m1)&#936;MP to (m1)&#936;DP. The conversion to (m1)&#936;TP is catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced &#936; into m1&#936;TP (37% yield), the novel chemo&#8208;enzymatic route from &#936;MP offers greatly improved metrics of reaction efficiency (68% isolated yield) and sustainability (&#8764;3&#8208;fold less waste). The synthetic &#936;TP and m1&#936;TP replace UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C&#8208;C coupling and phosphorylation toward efficient preparation of m1&#936;TP.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling for Programmable Remote Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicarbonyl compounds are structural motifs that have been extensively utilized in synthetic chemistry, and their downstream transformations have proven valuable in synthesizing numerous heterocycles. Conventional methods for accessing such compounds include the Stetter reaction, the Michael reaction, and Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. However, a flexible and enabling platform for obtaining all types of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls remains undeveloped. Reported herein is a unified approach to access a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls through a radical&#8208;promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;&#8208;amino esters, three&#8208;component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Complementary Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Functionalized Mixed Conducting Terpolymers for High Performance n&#8208;type Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Healable Inverters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs),crucial for integrated circuits in wearable bioelectronics,demand organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) that exhibit efficient mixed conduction and biological functionality for practical applications.However,the development of self&#8208;healing OMIECs has not yet been achieved due to the lack of suitable synthetic strategies.Here,we present a design concept through incorporating dynamic cross&#8208;linked hydrogen&#8208;bonded in the polymer backbone for the first demonstration of self&#8208;healing polymeric mixed conductors, enabling high&#8208;performing OECTs and high gain, self&#8208;healing inverters. These devices exhibit a mixed conducting figure of merit &#181;C* of 118 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, three times higher than the copolymer without hydrogen bond, along with simultaneously improved volumetric capacitance and electron mobility. These improvements are attributed to the unique microstructure created by hydrogen bond, which results in a closer &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance within smaller crystalline domain sizes. Additionally, a cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;processing side chain removal method is proposed, which retains high performance in n&#8208;type OECTs. Remarkably, inverters based on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded terpolymer demonstrate high gain and self&#8208;healing capabilities through solvent vapor exposure and annealing treatment. Insights from these terpolymers emphasize the use of dynamic hydrogen bonds in the conjugated backbone to enhance performance and enable self&#8208;healing high&#8208;gain inverters, advancing wearable bioelectronics for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of Dye&#8208;Derived Carbon Dots into Carbon Nitride Nanosheets for Enhanced Photoindcued Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots have made significant advancements in photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo&#8208;ATRP), achieving ultrafast reaction rates and precise control over the resulting polymers. However, their ultrasmall size necessitates time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive purification steps, which can ultimately lead to undesirable product contamination. In this study, we integrated dye&#8208;derived carbon dots (NCD) into nitrogen&#8208;deficient carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets via a hydrothermal process, forming NCD@CN heterojunctions with an expanded delocalized heterocyclic structure, enhanced specific surface area and improved light absorption. The chemical linkages between the two components created NCD@CN heterojunctions, which improved interfacial interactions and promoted efficient charge transfer. The NCD@CN heterojunctions demonstrated ultrahigh activity, comparable to the NCD precursors, achieving a turnover number up to 1780 and a turnover frequency up to 59.3 min&#8208;1. This led to the production of polymers with tailor&#8208;made structures, predicted molecular weights and narrow dispersities. Additionally, they enabled complete catalyst recovery across multiple polymerization cycles. The incorporation of NCD into CN nanosheets affords new territory for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts at the atomic level and provides alternative pathways for ultrafast photo&#8208;ATRP processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Enhanced NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can significantly enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy, via the transfer of polarization from unpaired electrons to nuclei. As a result, there is considerable interest in improving DNP efficiency, particularly through the development of new polarizing agents (PAs). Here, a series of 32 PAs, including 26 dinitroxide and 6 hetero biradicals, of which 11 are introduced for the first time, were evaluated&#160;in DNP NMR experiments at magnetic field strengths of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T. The PAs&#160;soluble in aqueous media were compared for different proton concentrations. A detailed comparison of the enhancement factors, polarization build&#8208;up times, contribution factors, and the resulting overall sensitivity factors is provided. We find that the class of narrow&#8208;line&#8208;broad&#8208;line biradicals not only yield the best performance at high field (21.1 T and 14.1 T), but also remain among the best at intermediate fields (9.4 T). Specifically, we find that SNAPol&#8208;1 and HyTEK2 are consistently among the best performing radicals at any field. Among the dinitroxide biradicals, notably at 9.4 T, the AsymPol&#8208;POK and M&#8208;TinyPol families stand out in proton&#8208;dense aqueous matrices, and a newly&#8208;developed dinitroxide, NaphPolCbo, is found to provide the best overall sensitivity factor in organic solvent.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can significantly enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy, via the transfer of polarization from unpaired electrons to nuclei. As a result, there is considerable interest in improving DNP efficiency, particularly through the development of new polarizing agents (PAs). Here, a series of 32 PAs, including 26 dinitroxide and 6 hetero biradicals, of which 11 are introduced for the first time, were evaluated&#160;in DNP NMR experiments at magnetic field strengths of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T. The PAs&#160;soluble in aqueous media were compared for different proton concentrations. A detailed comparison of the enhancement factors, polarization build-up times, contribution factors, and the resulting overall sensitivity factors is provided. We find that the class of narrow-line-broad-line biradicals not only yield the best performance at high field (21.1 T and 14.1 T), but also remain among the best at intermediate fields (9.4 T). Specifically, we find that SNAPol-1 and HyTEK2 are consistently among the best performing radicals at any field. Among the dinitroxide biradicals, notably at 9.4 T, the AsymPol-POK and M-TinyPol families stand out in proton-dense aqueous matrices, and a newly-developed dinitroxide, NaphPolCbo, is found to provide the best overall sensitivity factor in organic solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biarylsultams as self&#8208;synthesizing autophotocatalysts are represented as repeating tile patterns on mosaic lamps, with different coloured lamps representing different substituted biarylsultam derivatives. Reflecting the self&#8208;synthesizing library concept, the lamps are suspended within a library. On the spines of the books are imprinted the photocatalytic synthetic transformations exemplifying the reductive power of biarylsultam organophotocatalysts, as demonstrated by Joshua P. Barham et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202423190).

Dysprosium cyclopentadienide is a single&#8208;molecule magnet. Like other organometallic compounds, it is highly sensitive to moisture and oxygen. Encapsulating it in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes protects it from decomposition by environmental water or oxygen and maintains its magnetic character, as reported by Haitao Zhang, Yoji Horii, Masahiro Yamashita et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503979).

A molecular cage was designed to trap cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;, a highly unstable anion, through collective weak interactions, as reported by Ming Liu et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202501187). By intentionally avoiding strong interactions, the cage effectively preserved the aromaticity of cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;, while its decomposition was directly monitored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Ultrasound&#8208;activated therapeutic and diagnostic materials exhibit superior imaging capabilities, efficient drug delivery and release, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, providing for clinical diagnostics and therapy. This review summarizes recent advancements in the design, performance, and optimization of ultrasound&#8208;mediated molecular/nanosystems for diverse biomedical applications. Furthermore, the review identifies existing challenges and outlines potential future directions to accelerate their clinical translation.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US) is a promising external excitation modality for bioapplications, offering significant advantages over X&#8208;rays or lasers due to its low cost, high biosafety, and ideal tissue penetration depth. US&#8208;activated theranostic materials, comprising organic, inorganic, and hybrid&#8208;based compounds, hold particular value in synergistic cancer therapeutic and diagnostic applications. These materials exhibit excellent imaging properties, high drug delivery and release efficiency, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, making them suitable for clinical diagnostic imaging and therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes recent research on the design, performance, and optimization of US&#8208;mediated molecules/nanosystems for a wide range of biomedical applications. Additionally, the multifunctional use of these sonosensitizers in imaging, drug delivery, and sonodynamic therapy, especially in combination with other treatments, could pave the way for innovative strategies in disease therapy. Finally, an overview of this field's challenges and potential future directions is provided, highlighting pathways to promote clinical translation and application.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks in Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

This review delves into the concept of computational screening for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs), proposing strategies to enhance their conductivity based on detailed statistical data and exploring their applications in organic electronic devices. It provides a comprehensive guide to the development of novel 2DCOFs and 2DCOF&#8208;based organic electronic devices. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs) are a unique class of crystalline porous materials interconnected by covalent bonds, which have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their chemical and structural diversity, as well as their applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, research on the electrical properties of 2DCOFs remains limited, despite their potential in organic electronics. Early studies recognized the poor electrical conductivity of 2DCOFs as a significant obstacle to their application in this field. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been proposed to enhance conductivity. This review first introduces the concept of computational screening for 2DCOFs and explores approaches to improve their intrinsic conductivity, with a focus on four key aspects: in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport, topology, bandgap, and morphology. It then examines the application of pristine 2DCOFs in organic electronics, including applications in field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, photodetectors, and chemiresistive gas sensors. We support these strategies with detailed statistical data, providing a comprehensive guide for the design and development of novel 2DCOFs for organic electronics. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the challenges that remain to be addressed in this emerging area.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs) are a unique class of crystalline porous materials interconnected by covalent bonds, which have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their chemical and structural diversity, as well as their applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, research on the electrical properties of 2DCOFs remains limited, despite their potential in organic electronics. Early studies recognized the poor electrical conductivity of 2DCOFs as a significant obstacle to their application in this field. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been proposed to enhance conductivity. This review first introduces the concept of computational screening for 2DCOFs and explores approaches to improve their intrinsic conductivity, with a focus on four key aspects: in-plane and out-of-plane charge transport, topology, bandgap, and morphology. It then examines the application of pristine 2DCOFs in organic electronics, including applications in field-effect transistors, memristors, photodetectors, and chemiresistive gas sensors. We support these strategies with detailed statistical data, providing a comprehensive guide for the design and development of novel 2DCOFs for organic electronics. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the challenges that remain to be addressed in this emerging area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Olympic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaporation&#8208;assisted approach was used to fabricate ring&#8208;interlocked elastomers, wherein DMF was removed from the LpHE/DMF system to facilitate the formation of a global LpHE polycatenane network as a representative example. This method offers a simple, versatile, and effective strategy for the fabrication of topologically intricate materials.







Abstract
Catenated networks exclusively composed of intertwining rings were first envisioned as &#8220;Olympic gels&#8221; by Pierre&#8208;Gilles de Gennes four decades ago but have not been successfully prepared in artificial materials yet due to the challenge in synthesis. Herein, we present a bio&#8208;inspired, evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy to address this issue. In our design, the evaporation of liquid catalysts that induce ring&#8208;chain equilibrium of polymer systems drives macrocycles to encounter and assists their catenation through reversible cyclization. Complete removal of liquid catalysts stabilizes the resulting ring&#8208;interlocked networks by deactivating the catenation&#8208;decatenation process. The strategy is demonstrated by the system of hydroxyethyl lipoate (LpHE) and dimethyl formamide (DMF). The results indicate that DMF evaporation leads to the formation of global LpHE polycatenane networks. This evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy displays versatility in several tested cyclic monomers, highlighting its potential as a general approach to fabricate ring&#8208;interlocked elastomers and topologically intricate materials.

         <title>p&#8208;Type TiO2 Nanotubes: Quantum Confinement and Pt Single Atom Decoration Enable High Selectivity Photocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;type TiO2 nanotubes with quantum confinement effect enable photocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia. The decoration with Pt single atoms significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward ammonia while the quantum confinement effect and p&#8208;type conductivity of the nanotubes maintain their key roles in the photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
We synthesize p&#8208;type TiO2 nanotubes that allow band&#8208;gap adjustment by quantum confinement. These tubes therefore enable reductive photocatalytic reactions that are not thermodynamically possible on classic titania photocatalysts. Here, we demonstrate the direct photocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia without any need of hole scavengers. The quantum confinement effect (and thus the thermodynamic driving force) can be controlled by the thickness of the nanotube walls. Notably, the use of Pt single atoms as cocatalysts decorated on the TiO2 nanotubes additionally offers a superior ammonia production and a remarkable enhanced selectivity compared to Pt nanoparticles. Overall, the work not only highlights the potential of size&#8208;controlled modifications of electronic properties in extending the utility of a most classical photocatalyst but also exemplifies its use in technologically relevant reactions.

         <title>Improving Internal Exciton Confinement for Efficient CdZnSeS&#8208;Based Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdZnSeS/ZnS blue quantum dots were synthesized by growing a giant alloy CdZnSeS core with gradient composition and a low Fermi energy level position. The constructed blue quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLED) had a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24%, which is the highest value reported so far.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are thought to be the base for next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the performance of blue&#8208;emitting QLEDs still falls behind those of green and red ones, which can be attributed to the energy loss from Auger recombination and the strong coupling of excitons with surface states. Blue quantum dots (QDs) with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores are expected to improve the internal confinement of excitons due to the nonmonotonical energy landscape of their conduction band, while they haven't shown high performance in QLEDs due to insufficient optimization of their shell structures. In this work, giant CdZnSeS alloy cores were synthesized by diffusing Zn atoms into CdSeS cores, so that the core/shell lattice stress was released due to the optimized gradient compositions. As a result, exciton transfer and Auger recombination are both suppressed, leading to a breakthrough external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24% in blue QLEDs with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores. Compared to the more extensively studied blue quantum dots with CdSeZn alloy cores, blue QLEDs with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores also benefit from the suppressed Fermi level and nonmonotonical energy landscape of the conduction band minimum (CBM), which are crucial for confining the wavefunctions of the excitons. The improved exciton confinement explained the superior performances of giant CdZnSeS alloy cores over CdSeZn cores in blue QLEDs.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical&#8208;Enzymatic Conversion of PET to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction Over Ru&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8208;Co3O4 bifunctional catalyst was developed for EG oxidation and NO3&#8722; reduction via electrochemical&#8208;enzymatic technique to generate formic acid and ammonia, respectively. This advancement supports green chemical projects in energy conversion and waste utilization while providing new insights for the synthesis of hydrogen energy carriers.








Abstract
Electrochemical reforming presents a sustainable route for the conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH). However, its widespread application has been constrained by low selectivity due to the complexity of reduction processes and thus energy scaling limitations. In this study, the atomically dispersed Ru sites in Co3O4 synergistically interact with Co centers, facilitating the adsorption and activation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and ethylene glycol (EG), resulting in a remarkable HCOOH selectivity of 99% and a yield rate of 11.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 surpassing that of pristine Co3O4 (55% and 3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, when applied as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, Ru&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% for NH3 production (3.54&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at &#8208;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. Additionally, we developed a prototype device powered by a commercial silicon photovoltaic cell, enabling on&#8208;site solar&#8208;driven production of formate and NH3 through enzyme&#8208;catalyzed PET and NO3&#8722; conversion. This study offers a viable approach for waste valorization and green chemical production, paving the way for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Gromomycins: An Unprecedented Class of Triterpene Antibiotics Produced by a Novel Biosynthetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

Gromomycins represent a novel class of pentacyclic triterpene antibiotics with a unique biosynthetic pathway independent of the squalene route. These compounds exhibit potent activity against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including MRSA, and their unprecedented cyclization mechanism provides new insight into bacterial triterpene biosynthesis.








Abstract
The current situation with drug&#8208;resistant microbial pathogens is critical, dictating an acute need for novel efficient antibiotics. Herein, we report a new class of antibiotics named gromomycins with significant activity, especially against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including methicillin&#8208; and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gromomycins are pentacyclic triterpenes with a cyclic guanidino group forming the fifth six&#8208;membered ring. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify the gromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, since it could not be assigned by any available bioinformatics tools, highlighting its unique biosynthetic route. Using gene cluster engineering, feeding experiments, and LC&#8208;MS and NMR analyses we have proposed the biosynthetic pathway for gromomycins, which are the first bacterial triterpenes synthesized independently of the squalene pathway. They also exhibit a so far unprecedented cyclization route that utilizes a hexaprenylguanidine linear precursor. Leveraging our understanding of their biosynthesis, we have identified additional gromomycin producers, resulting in the isolation of novel bioactive derivatives.

         <title>Structure of a DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag16Cl2 Nanocluster in Solution</title>

X&#8208;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis are used to determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag nanocluster.








Abstract
We determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag16Cl2 nanocluster using X&#8209;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis. We find that the structure in solution exhibits both displacive and rotational distortions compared to the known crystal structure. Additionally, our measurements are sensitive toward changes in DNA conformation, revealing that the DNA scaffold in solution exhibits significantly more flexibility than when conformationally locked in the crystalline form. Our results demonstrate the capability to determine the structure of DNA&#8208;stabilized clusters beyond their crystallized form, an essential step toward understanding differences between their solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state photophysical properties.

         <title>&#8220;Crystallinity Wave&#8221;&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;crystallinity wave&#8221; induced regional difference ripening strategy was developed to fabricate hollow multi&#8208;shell covalent organic framework particles (COF HoMSs). The as&#8208;prepared COF HoMSs exhibit significantly enhanced specific capacitance as a supercapacitor electrode material when using KI as the redox electrolyte.








Abstract
Hollow multi&#8208;shell covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with abundant modular interfaces, high loading capacity, and various microenvironments are expected to hold great potential for chemical separation, heterogeneous catalysis, and energy storage/conversion. However, the synthetic methodology of COF hollow multi&#8208;shell nanoarchitectures has not been established. Herein, we demonstrate an ingenious &#8220;crystallinity wave&#8221;&#8208;induced regional difference ripening strategy to synthesize a series of hollow multi&#8208;shell COF particles with controllable shell numbers and shell thickness. The methodology relies on the isolation effect of the local crystalline COF thin layer inserted between the two layers of amorphous covalent organic polymer by the short&#8208;time Ostwald ripening, so that different regions of the particles exhibit distinct reaction stages before reaching chemical equilibrium in the subsequent dynamic imine exchange reaction, and then regions that tend to hydrolyze dissolve during the complete ripening process to form a hollow multi&#8208;shell structure. Remarkably, this strategy can be extended to prepare other hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs by altering monomers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, the obtained hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs are used as the electrode materials for supercapacitor. Benefiting from the short mass transfer path of the hollow multi&#8208;shell structure, ordered channels of the COF, and their&#160;high surface area, the as&#8208;prepared particles exhibit remarkably enhanced specific capacitance.

         <title>&#8220;Naked Nickel&#8221;&#8208;Catalyzed Heteroaryl&#8211;Heteroaryl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
We report that an air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221;, Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3, can efficiently catalyze heteroaryl&#8211;heteroaryl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMC) reactions in the absence of exogenous ligands. This protocol permits the construction of &gt;15 different heterobiaryls containing multiple Lewis basic heteroatoms from a broad set of 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;nucleophiles. 








Abstract
In this article, we report that the air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221;, [Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3], is a competent catalyst in the catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction (SMC) between heteroaryl bromides and heteroaromatic boron&#8208;based nucleophiles. The catalytic system is characterized by its ability to avoid decomposition or deactivation in the presence of multiple Lewis basic sites. The protocol permits the formation of C&#8210;C bonds between two heteroaryl moieties in the absence of complex exogenous ligands, thus minimizing screening procedures and simplifying reaction setups. This method accommodates combinations of distinct 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides and 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;based nucleophiles.

         <title>Electrical Energy Storage by Poly(ionic Liquids)</title>

         <dc:description>
Manipulating ionic and van der Waals (vdW) interactions stabilizes polarized anion&#8208;cation pairs, thus maintaining electrical energy storage for extended periods by creating ergotropically favorable non&#8208;equilibrium gradient states.








Abstract
Manipulating van der Waals (vdW) and ionic interactions in polymers enable energy storage and formations of active or passive components of electrical circuits. The energy storage is achieved by electrically activating ion pairs containing polymers, which create ergotropically favorable non&#8208;equilibrium gradient states. Molecular&#8208;level events responsible for this behavior involve concurrent ion pairs' polarization&#8208;depolarization gradients and conformational changes of aliphatic tails that collectively contribute to lowering local disorder states. Manipulating ionic and vdW interactions stabilizes polarized anion&#8208;cation pairs, thus maintaining electrical energy storage for extended periods. These transparent and easily moldable materials require no multilayered assemblies, and their functional features depend upon polarization conditions and ionic&#8208;vdW interactions, making them applicable in energy storage and other devices transcending classical time intricacy limits.

         <title>Efficient Upcycling of Polyolefin Waste to Light Aromatics via Coupling C&#9472;C Scission and Carbonylation</title>

The coupling of polyolefin cracking with CO insertion enables the efficient one&#8208;pot conversion of polyolefins into light aromatics under mild conditions and effectively bypasses the induction period in traditional Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS). 








Abstract
The upcycling of waste polyolefins into light aromatics has great potential to generate hundreds of millions of tons of valuable aromatic carbon feedstock. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates the traditional cracking&#8208;aromatization process of PE with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by four times, with an absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280&#160;&#176;C. The insertion of CO into the Ru&#8208;alkyl intermediates formed during polyolefin cracking facilitates the generation of active oxygenate species, guarantees an ideal C&#9472;C chain length range, and smooths the way for subsequent efficient aromatization on Hol&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5@S1 with a short b axis. According to the technical economic analysis, this low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of the petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.

However, the conventional high-temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates the traditional cracking-aromatization process of PE with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by four times, with an absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280&#160;&#176;C.

According to the technical economic analysis, this low-carbon-footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of the petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Responsive Immunomodulator Prodrugs Rejuvenating Immune Microenvironment for &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;responsive immunomodulator prodrugs are constructed with imiquimod and boron dipyrromethene via a reactive oxygen species&#8208;cleavable linker for cancer phototherapy and immunotherapy. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the immunomodulator prodrug effectively reverses the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and inhibits primary and distant tumor progression, with excellent immune memory for suppressing spontaneous lung metastasis.








Abstract
Light&#8208;activatable prodrugs have been applied in precision cancer therapy because of their spatiotemporal controllability and minimal toxic side effects. However, the reported prodrugs were limited by the ultraviolet and visible light regions, which seriously restricted their application in deep tissues. Developing a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activatable release system remains a great challenge. Herein, the 808&#160;nm light&#8208;activatable prodrugs were constructed with imiquimod (R837) and NIR boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker for photoimmunotherapy of &#8220;cold&#8221; cancer. ROS produced by BODIPY could cleave the linker under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, and R837 was released spatiotemporally at the tumor site. The combination of the immune response produced by R837 and immunogenic cell death caused by phototherapy significantly potentiated adaptive antitumor immunity and enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration for tumor metastasis and distant tumor inhibition. This work provides an effective NIR light&#8208;activatable controlled release system for cancer immunotherapy and metastasis suppression.

         <title>Engineering an Excellent &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4&#8208;Inspired UV Nonlinear Optical Material Through Secondary Building Unit Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#946;&#8208;BBO&#8208;like compound, Li3[Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]&#183;7H2O (LBOC), has been successfully designed through the substitution of secondary building units (SBUs). Thanks to the thoughtfully engineered [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; SBU, LBOC not only inherits the strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response characteristic of &#946;&#8208;BBO but also effectively mitigates its excessive birefringence. Additionally, it features a short UV cut&#8208;off edge at 200&#160;nm. Importantly, its favorable growth habit underscores its potential as a promising UV nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal.








Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with tailored properties has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit, yet remains challenging to achieve. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;performance UV NLO material, Li3[Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]&#183;7H2O (LBOC), by substituting the [B3O6] functional building units (FBUs) in the classic &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 (&#946;&#8208;BBO) with meticulously designed [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; secondary building units (SBUs). The [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; SBUs within LBOC preserve the ordered arrangement of the [B3O6] FBUs found in &#946;&#8208;BBO, enabling LBOC to inherit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response from &#946;&#8208;BBO. Additionally, the increased dimensionality of the [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8722; SBUs, compared to the planar [B3O6] FBUs, leads to a reduction in optical anisotropy. Consequently, LBOC demonstrates a moderate birefringence of 0.067@589.3&#160;nm, lower than that of &#946;&#8208;BBO (0.118@589.3&#160;nm). Notably, bulk crystals of LBOC can be easily grown using a straightforward solution evaporation method, making it a promising candidate for UV NLO applications. This strategic design of the SBU opens new avenues for the rational development of NLO crystals with tailored properties.

         <title>Conversion of Bestmann Ylide into Carbophosphinocarbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene(CPC) was synthesized via a click&#8208;type reaction. Experimental and computational studies reveal its remarkable electron&#8208;donating ability. Reactivity studies demonstrate its versatility as a stabilizing ligand, a strong nucleophile for CO&#8322; activation, and a potent Br&#248;nsted base for imidazolium deprotonation.








Abstract
The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene (CPC) has been synthesized through a click&#8208;type reaction between the super strained carborane&#8208;fused borirane 1,2&#8208;BN(SiMe3)2&#8211;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 and Bestmann ylide Ph3PCCO. The [Cl(CO)&#8322;Ir&#8208;CPC] and [Cl3Ga&#8208;CPC] complexes were synthesized, allowing the measurement of their Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and the sum of Cl&#9472;Ga&#9472;Cl bond angles (&#8721;ClGaCl), respectively. These data highlight their remarkable electron&#8208;donating ability. Further insights into its electron&#8208;donating properties were gained through theoretical calculations, including analysis of frontier orbitals and proton affinity (PA). Preliminary reactivity investigations demonstrate that the new CPC readily forms adducts with boranes and can effectively stabilize borenium cations. Its strong nucleophilicity enables reactions with carbon dioxide, while its exceptional Br&#248;nsted basicity allows it to deprotonate imidazolium to generate carbene species.

         <title>Engineering Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off of Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Zn&#8211;Air Battery</title>

A composite electrocatalyst containing MoC nanoparticles and Fe&#8722;N4 sites (MoC/Fe&#9472;NC) is developed for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). MoC accelerates the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of ORR on the Fe center while weakening the *OH adsorption and reinforcing the Fe&#9472;N bonds, thus breaking the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off of electrocatalyst toward excellent ORR performance for temperature&#8208;adaptive Zn&#8211;air battery. 








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, integrating high active and long&#8208;term durability on SACs is still challenging due to the severe limitations of the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report an integrative electrocatalyst combining isolated Fe sites and MoC nanoparticles (MoC/Fe&#9472;NC). MoC nanoparticles accelerate ORR kinetics via the proton&#8208;feeding effect and optimize Fe site microstructure. Thus, MoC/Fe&#9472;NC exhibits a high alkaline ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.916&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, and exceptional durability of 50k cycles with 5&#160;mV E1/2 loss. The observed ORR performance is further verified in a zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) with a high peak power density of 316&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and operational stability over 1000&#160;h. Moreover, the fabricated temperature&#8208;adaptive quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB can cycle stably for 150&#160;h under alternating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and experiment characterizations, involving scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques and distribution of relaxation times analysis, reveal that the excellent capabilities of MoC/Fe&#9472;NC arise from accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, weakened *OH adsorption, and strengthened Fe&#9472;N bonds fueled by MoC nanoparticles. This work sheds light on breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off barrier of SACs for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Unraveling Electrode Surface Chemistry in Determining Interphase Stability and Deposition Homogeneity for Anode&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose the effect of the current collector's surface functionality on determining the reversibility of anode&#8208;free potassium metal batteries. The current collector with a lower Fermi level suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and induces an inorganic&#8208;rich thin SEI. Additionally, the current collector with potassiophilic species creates abundant nucleation sites and promotes K planar deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal batteries with an anode&#8208;less/&#8208;free configuration could realize competitive energy density, which requires exceptional potassium plating/stripping reversibility via guiding smooth potassium growth and building mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Electrolyte engineering has been the most widely adopted strategy, but there is less understanding of the electrode effect. We demonstrate that the extent of electrolyte decomposition could also be regulated through electrode surface modification. Elevating the work function of an Al current collector by coating a thin layer of Ni&#8208;decorated carbon nanofiber could greatly suppress the copious solvent reduction, leading to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Such SEIs possess a large elastic deformation energy to accommodate the volume change and a high ionic conductivity to boost the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the potassiophilic nickel species offer abundant active sites to induce homogeneous potassium deposition. Benefiting from the synergy of stable interphases and promoted nucleation, the modified Al enables a 4.4&#160;V anode&#8208;free cell in a normal&#8208;concentration electrolyte without anode precycling.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Boosts Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence in Chiral Mn(II) Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a pair of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, R/S&#8208;1, were designed, exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (gPL &gt;&#160;3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3) and strong scintillation (light yields &gt;&#160;70&#160;000 photons/MeV). Their circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) properties were evaluated using our home&#8208;built setup. By incorporating hydrogen bonds, another pair, R/S&#8208;2, achieved a nearly seven&#8208;fold increase in gPL and a nearly fifteen&#8208;fold enhancement in gRL. This study provides a new strategy for advancing chiral scintillators.








Abstract
Chiral scintillators combining scintillation and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) present a novel avenue for controlling light propagation and reducing optical crosstalk in conventional scintillators. However, quantitative evaluation of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) and strategies for enhancing performance under X&#8208;ray excitation remain underexplored. Herein, we conducted the designed synthesis of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)2MnBr4&#183;2Br&#8722; (R/S&#8208;1), which exhibit intense CPL with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of 94.4% (R&#8208;1) and 94.1% (S&#8208;1) and PL dissymmetry factors (gPL) of &#8722;3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 (R&#8208;1) and&#160;+&#160;3.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 (S&#8208;1). They demonstrate strong scintillation performance with record&#8208;breaking light yields of 70&#160;061 and 68&#160;514 photons/MeV in chiral scintillators. We pioneered quantitative evaluation of the CPRL of R/S&#8208;1, achieving radioluminescence (RL) dissymmetry factors (gRL) of &#8722;2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and&#160;+&#160;2.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. By incorporating hydrogen bonds into the structures through rational ligand design to facilitate chiral transfer, Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)MnBr4 (R/S&#8208;2) achieve the gPL values of &#8722;2.56&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and&#160;+&#160;2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 with nearly seven times higher than those of R/S&#8208;1. More inspiringly, the gRL value of R&#8208;2 increased to &#8722;2.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 with a 15 times increase relative to R&#8208;1, representing the highest CPRL in lead&#8208;free chiral scintillators. This work not only manifests a new design strategy for advancing chiral scintillators but also establishes a standard approach for evaluating CPRL properties.

         <title>Switching Products Selectivity in Electrocatalytic C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds Activation and CO2 Carboxylation via Cu&#9472;S Bond Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral objective, we presented a groundbreaking achievement of heterogeneous electrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and carboxylation of CO&#8322;. Crystal engineering of Cu&#9472;S bonds not only efficiently enhanced the activity of C(sp3)&#9472;H carboxylation with CO2, but also significantly realized chemoselectivity during CO2 carboxylation. DFT revealed the origin of differences in the activity and chemoselectivity between CuS(001) and Cu2S(110).








Abstract
Inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds activation along with CO2 carboxylation to prepare high&#8208;value carboxylic acids is a sustainable route for achieving the carbon&#8208;neutral goal, but the current catalytic performance is far from satisfying the demand. Targeting this problem, it was found that crystal engineering of Cu&#9472;S bonds not only significantly enhanced the activity of C(sp3)&#9472;H activation and CO2 carboxylation in an electrocatalytic system, but also efficiently realized chemoselectivity in the CO2 carboxylation process. Specifically, hexagonal CuS(001) electrocatalyst could readily achieve C(sp3)&#9472;H bond activation of alkanes and aromatics along with CO2 carboxylation, exhibiting almost complete chemoselectivity to carbon chain increased monocarboxylation acids. Intriguingly, hexagonal Cu2S(110) electrocatalyst, which was prepared by phase transition, could realize highly selective alkanes and aromatics dicarboxylation with CO2 to produce dicarboxylation acids. Notably, biomass compound 2&#8208;methylfuran was efficiently converted into furan&#8208;2&#8208;acetic acid over CuS(001); while 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran was quantitatively converted to the degradable polymer precursor furan&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid over Cu2S(110). Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) results revealed the origin of differences in the activity and chemoselectivity over CuS(001) and Cu2S(110) catalysts.

         <title>Intervalence Charge Transfer and Exothermic and Isoenergetic Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in Far&#8208;Red Capturing Zinc Phthalocyanine Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of intervalence charge transfer and exothermic and isoenergetic symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in far&#8208;red capturing zinc phthalocyanine dimers is demonstrated. Further, the splitting of redox peak and near&#8208;infrared intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) signal have been used as diagnostic markers to prove the IVCT mechanism and occurrence of symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) in newly synthesized identical pairs of ZnPc chromophores.








Abstract
Orientation and distance&#8208;dependent intervalence charge transfer phenomenon is demonstrated in far&#8208;red capturing zinc phthalocyanine dimers connected by a bis&#8208;acetylene&#8211;phenyl &#960;&#8208;spacer (ortho, meta, or para positions) upon oxidizing one of the phthalocyanine rings, resulting in split oxidation waves and a new optical transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. Optical studies initially probed the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation events in these dimers wherein solvent polarity&#8208;dependent quenching was witnessed. Interestingly, efficient quenching in nonpolar toluene was also seen for the ortho dimer. Free&#8208;energy calculations supported symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in polar solvents and the ortho dimer even in nonpolar solvents under isoenergetic (endothermic by &#8764;40&#160;mV) conditions. Molecular electrostatic potential maps generated on DFT&#8208;optimized structures revealed quadrupolar charge transfer states, more so in polar media. The time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations revealed the conversion of the quadrupolar charge transfer states to bipolar charge&#8208;separated states from different singlet&#8211;singlet excitations. Femtosecond transient absorption studies covering broad temporal and spatial scales provided evidence for the charge separation process, including that for the ortho dimer in toluene, where an isoenergetic process was predicted. The charge&#8208;separated states lasted for 200&#8211;500&#160;ps depending upon dimer linkage. These unprecedented findings reveal the potential applications of the investigated phthalocyanine dimers in energy harvesting, photocatalytic, and pertinent optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transport Divergence in Ultrastable Heterometal&#8208;Oxo Clusters Exerting Significant Effect on Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in orbital hybridization between heterometallic elements in heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M&#160;=&#160;Ti, Zr, and Hf) has a significant effect on the distribution of frontier molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in the transmission of photogenerated electrons to different active sites, thus leading to different catalytic activities.








Abstract
The transfer path of photogenerated charges greatly affects the final photocatalytic performance, but this important fact has not been clearly demonstrated experimentally. Here, we construct an ultrastable crystalline catalytic system including three heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters, Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M&#160;=&#160;group IVB metal&#8208;Ti/Zr/Hf), which include cubic metal&#8208;oxo cluster core with eight Bi atoms at the vertices, one M atom at the body center, and six M atoms above the cubic face centers. It is worth noted that the change of group IVB elements in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A can specifically modulate the LUMO&#8208;HOMO orbitals to distribute on different active metal atoms. This allows it to be an excellent model system to verify the effect of the transport paths of photogenerated charges on photoreactivity. In model reaction based on CO2 photoreduction, Bi8Ti7&#8208;TBC4A displays superior photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion rate of 3580.02&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Bi8Zr7&#8208;TBC4A and 4 times that of Bi8Hf7&#8208;TBC4A. In situ characterization accompanied by density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the difference in orbital hybridization between Bi and IVB group elements largely affects the orbital distribution of frontier molecular orbital levels in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A, leading to the transport of photogenerated charges to metal active sites with different reactivities, and thus widely differing photocatalytic performances. This is the first model catalyst system that explores the effect of different photogenerated charge transport pathways on photoreactivity.

         <title>Guiding Design of Mn&#8208;Rich Phosphate Cathodes with Less Intrinsic Antisite Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of lower valence metal cations (vs. Ti4+) with lower electronegativity (vs. Ti4+) and good solid solubility in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system can not only construct a sodium&#8208;rich environment to reduce the possibility of Mn occupying sodium vacancies but also enhance interatomic interactions of Mn&#9472;O bond to restrain Mn delocalization, synergistically reducing the intrinsic&#8208;antisite&#8208;defects (IASDs) of Mn2+&#8208;occupied Na vacancies (Mn/Na&#9633;) in structure.








Abstract
The serious voltage hysteresis phenomenon in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 has received extensive research interests, which is determined by the intrinsic&#8208;antisite&#8208;defects (IASDs) of Mn2+ resided in Na vacancies (Mn/Na&#9633;) in structure. However, a general guideline to decrease IASDs is still lacking for the design of a higher&#8208;performance Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system. Herein, we find that generation of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system is mainly related to Na vacancies and weaker Mn&#9472;O bonds in structure. The more Na vacancies, the more probability for Mn2+ occupation on Na sites. Meanwhile, the weaker Mn&#9472;O bond, the more probability for Mn2+ delocalization/migration to other sites, finally leading to the Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs. To decrease Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs, we propose to introduce dopants with lower valence (vs. Ti4+), lower electronegativity (vs. Ti4+), and good solid solubility in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system. Based on the guiding rule, we have selected several doping cations (including Cr3+, Ti3+, Fe3+, and V3+) to construct a Na&#8208;rich environment and enhance Mn&#9472;O strength. Among various dopants, the substitution of V3+ for Ti4+ leads to the strongest Mn&#8211;O interaction, thus demonstrating the most effective suppression of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs. With these discoveries, we further developed a series of V&#8208;doped Mn&#8208;richer phosphate cathodes, Na3.3+yMn1.15VyTi0.85&#8208;y(PO4)3 (0.1&#160;&#8804;&#160;y&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.25) as the promising candidates for Na&#8208;ion batteries.

Herein, we find that generation of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs in Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;MnTi(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; system is mainly related to Na vacancies and weaker Mn&#9472;O bonds in structure. The more Na vacancies, the more probability for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; occupation on Na sites. Meanwhile, the weaker Mn&#9472;O bond, the more probability for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; delocalization/migration to other sites, finally leading to the Mn/Na&lt;sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;/sub&gt; IASDs. To decrease Mn/Na&lt;sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;/sub&gt; IASDs, we propose to introduce dopants with lower valence (vs. Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;), lower electronegativity (vs. Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;), and good solid solubility in Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;MnTi(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; system. Based on the guiding rule, we have selected several doping cations (including Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) to construct a Na-rich environment and enhance Mn&#9472;O strength. Among various dopants, the substitution of V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; for Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; leads to the strongest Mn&#8211;O interaction, thus demonstrating the most effective suppression of Mn/Na&lt;sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;/sub&gt; IASDs. With these discoveries, we further developed a series of V-doped Mn-richer phosphate cathodes, Na&lt;sub&gt;3.3+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.85-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0.1&#160;&#8804;&#160;y&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.25) as the promising candidates for Na-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Deep Eutectic Solvent Achieves Ultra&#8208;Low Polarization Zinc Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) is proposed as an electrolyte for rechargeable zinc metal batteries, reducing the polarization of deep eutectic solvents to a level comparable to that of aqueous electrolytes. HEDES inhibits side reactions and dendrite growth, and its aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure facilitates rapid interfacial ion transport, enabling long&#8208;term stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of green solvents, have emerged as promising candidates for electrolytes due to their exceptional electrochemical stability. However, the DES always exhibits unacceptable polarization of cells due to its high viscosity and low ionic conductivity, which limit its practical application in batteries. In this work, the cell polarization of DES is effectively reduced to a level comparable to that of pure aqueous electrolytes by increasing the entropy of DES via the disorder&#8208;making strategy of solvation structure. Theoretically, constructing the high&#8208;entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) promotes the formation of more aggregates with high disorder, which accelerates mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the proposed HEDES (configuration entropy 17 times higher than traditional electrolyte) can achieve durable zinc plating/stripping behavior for more than 2000&#160;h with low polarization and still maintain good stability even in extreme environments. The cylindrical zinc&#8208;ion capacitor under gram&#8208;level loading can achieve a high discharge current up to 3 A, providing ideas for the design of electrolytes for zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis and Spiral&#8208;Stair&#8208;Like Single Helix Assembly of Figure&#8208;Eight Cyclophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of chiral figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylenes via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed four consecutive intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions of dodecaynes with two flexible biphenyl units, resulting in increased rotational freedom of the reaction intermediates. The figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylene with ethyl and methyl side chains exhibits the spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like single helix assembly in the crystal due to CH&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;O interactions and the marked CPL amplification in solution.








Abstract
Helix assemblies of chiral molecules can transfer microscopic unimolecular chirality to macroscopic supramolecular chirality, enhancing various chiral properties. In addition to the commonly observed spiral&#8208;column&#8208;like helix assembly, a small number of spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like helix assemblies have also been reported in aromatic nanocarbons with multiple chirality&#8208;related irregularities. However, they require separation of diastereomers and/or enantiomers or do not have stable chirality. Here, we report the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylenes with stable helical chirality by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed four consecutive intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions of dodecaynes with two flexible biphenyl units. The chiral figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylene with ethyl and methyl side chains exhibits the spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like single helix assembly in the crystal due to CH&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;O interactions and good CPL properties in solution. Experimental verification of the enantio&#8208; and diastereodetermining steps of four consecutive [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions is also reported.

         <title>Cooperative Redox Reactions Encoded by Two Gene Clusters Enable Intermolecular Cycloaddition Cascade for the Formation of Meroaspochalasins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two independent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), flas and epi, being responsible for the biosynthesis of aspochalasin B (7) and pre&#8208;diene hemiacetal 21 (or 26), respectively, were identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavipes. A flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)&#8208;dependent oxidase FlasF in the flas cluster catalyzes the crucial oxidation to generate diverse aspochalasin monomers, particularly the dienophile 7. The cytochrome P450&#160;enzyme EpiC and short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme EpiD in the epi cluster collaboratively catalyze the formation of pre&#8208;diene 21 (or 26), which can spontaneously dehydrate to yield diene, leading to the nonenzymatic cascade of [4&#960; + 2&#960;] Diels&#8211;Alder and formal [5&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition reaction to generate meroaspochalasin (mAPO) dimers and trimer progressively. Moreover, the FAD&#8208;dependent oxidase EpiG catalyzes the hydroxylation at the C3 position of the diene as a critical step in the formation of mAPO trimers.








Abstract
Meroaspochalasins (mAPOs) are a group of intricate heteromers comprising two distinct subunits, dienophile aspochalasin, and diene isobenzofuran, of which the biosynthetic mechanism is of great interest yet unrevealed. In this study, two independent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), flas and epi, being responsible for the biosynthesis of aspochalasin B (7) and pre&#8208;diene hemiacetal 21 (or 26), respectively, were identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavipes. In vivo and in vitro studies proved that a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)&#8208;dependent oxidase FlasF in the flas cluster catalyzes the crucial oxidation to generate diverse aspochalasin monomers, particularly the dienophile 7. Interactive reduction catalyzed by the short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) FlasG and endogenous NADPH further increases the complexity of this anabolic network. The cytochrome P450 enzyme EpiC and SDR enzyme EpiD in the epi cluster collaboratively catalyze the formation of pre&#8208;diene 21 (or 26), which can spontaneously dehydrate to yield a diene, leading to the nonenzymatic cascade of [4&#960; + 2&#960;] Diels&#8211;Alder and formal [5&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition reaction to generate mAPO dimers and trimer progressively.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Cobalt Centers Realized by Rational p&#9472;&#960; Conjugation Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Li&#9472;S Batteries</title>

Based on the correlation between p&#9472;&#960; conjugation strength and LUMO energy level, we designed a unique coordination environment that can result in an electron&#8208;deficient state at the Co sites (CNT@f&#8208;CoNC). Compared to the commonly reported porphyrin&#8208;like Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (CNT@CoSA), the chemisorption and catalytic activity of the CNT@f&#8208;CoNC towards lithium polysulfides are significantly enhanced, due to the Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. With the CNT@f&#8208;CoNC electrode, high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Rational design of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can enhance their catalytic activity, which is of great significance for high&#8208;loading and lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries. Inspired by the Lewis acid&#8211;base theory, we design a unique coordination environment for constructing electron&#8208;deficient Co SACs on carbon nanotubes (named as CNT@f&#8208;CoNC), which function as a Lewis acid, to enhance the chemisorption and catalytic activity towards polysulfides (Lewis base). Compared with porphyrin&#8208;like Co SACs, electron&#8208;deficient Co SACs (Lewis acid) exhibit much stronger binding affinity towards polysulfides (Lewis base) and a significantly lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the sulfur reduction reaction. As expected, even with a high sulfur loading (6.9&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio (4.0&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), the areal capacity still reaches 7.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a 1.6&#160;Ah&#8208;class pouch cell is successfully assembled under the harsh conditions and delivers an energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries by modulating the local electronic density of metal sites through the rational design of the coordination environment.

         <title>Constructing Robust Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters are realized by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent. The electrolyte with this unique structure can promote to construct robust electrode/electrolyte interphases for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery with a capacity of 3.75 Ah exhibits a high energy density of 180&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.1 C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries show great promise for energy storage, but are plagued by poor cycling stability, which can be attributed to unfavorable electrode/electrolyte interphases for both anode and cathode. Here we design and achieve the anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters in electrolyte by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases simultaneously for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. The optimal electrolyte endows Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. The Li&#8211;SPAN batteries show excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 94.21% after 1215 cycles. Moreover, the assembled pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery under limited electrolyte condition (2.40&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) achieves a capacity of 3.75 Ah, corresponding to a high energy density of 180&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the battery. This work provides a good electrolyte design principle to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases for batteries.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Electrochromic Materials&#8208;Based Nanomotor for H2S&#8208;Controlled Drug Release in Synergistic Cancer Chemotherapy Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomotor efficiently target and penetrate tumors deeply through &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;mediated delivery, chemotactic behavior of chemoattractant HS&#8722; and local thermal gradient under the 780&#160;nm laser irradiation, achieving HS&#8722;&#8208;induced release of anticancer drug (OXA) to enhance synergistic chemotherapy and immunotherapy for tumors.








Abstract
Nanomotors hold tremendous potential for drug delivery. However, current nanomotors face limitations that compromise efficiency of drug utilization, including the use of inorganic materials with suboptimal soft interface and biocompatibility, uncontrollable drug release, insufficient directional control, and slow movement speeds. Herein, we present a novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven porous unsymmetric nanomotor with ultrafast motion, which utilizes hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;responsive cationic organic &#960;&#8208;electron structure&#8208;based electrochromic material (F12+) for the payload and controlled release of anionic anticancer drugs, enabling synergistic cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We demonstrate that the nanomotor can precisely target tumors driven by thermophoresis, tumor&#8208;targeting peptide (RGD), and H2S (highly expressed in tumors and acted as chemoattractants), which induces chemotactic behavior to guide nanomotors into tumors. Once in the tumors, the cationic F12+ is reduced to the diene F2 upon reaction with H2S, activating the nanomotor's NIR fluorescence for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and release in vivo. Upon exposure to H2S, the nanomotor undergoes disassembly due to the disruption of electrostatic interactions between the anionic anticancer drugs and the cationic F12+, leading to the precise and controlled drug release, ensuring uniform distribution across the tumor. This innovative strategy would open avenues for delivering mRNA vaccines or other anionic drugs.

         <title>A Modular Approach Toward BN&#8208;Embedded Terrylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) were synthesized in a modular manner. Manipulation of dipole moments of the BN&#8208;TDIs was achieved via different BN unit(s) insertion. Strong carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed in their crystals, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. BN&#8208;TDIs showcased typical electron transport behavior, making them one of the few examples of n&#8208;type BN&#8208;embedded molecules.








Abstract
This work presents the first example of heteroatoms embedded terrylene diimides (TDIs), which were synthesized from the BN&#8208;embedded imide building block in a modular manner. Through the control of the amount and orientations of the BN unit(s), the manipulation of dipole moments of the obtained BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) was achieved, which in turn extended the fluorescence of BN&#8208;TDIs to near infrared region. The structures of BN&#8208;TDIs were established via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Stronger carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed for BN&#8208;TDIs in their crystal structures compared with that of TDI, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. The organic thin film transistors based on BN&#8208;TDIs were also fabricated. BN&#8208;TDI&#8208;S showcased higher electron mobilities than that of TDI, indicating the potential of BN&#8208;TDIs as promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Hydrogermylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first remote hydrogermylation of alkenes, utilizing a rare base&#8208;catalyzed strategy in the absence of transition metal catalysts. The methodology is operationally simple and highly versatile, enabling up to 8&#8208;carbon chain walks. This advance expands the scope of remote functionalization for modifying traditionally unactivated sites.








Abstract
Although remote functionalization has emerged as a powerful strategy for modifying unactivated sites that are traditionally challenging to functionalize, there has been no remote hydrogermylation known to date. This work reports the first remote hydrogermylation of alkenes, achieved through a rare base&#8208;catalyzed approach&#8208;completely free of added transition metal catalysts. The methodology is operationally simple, versatile, and capable of achieving up to 8&#8208;carbon chain walks, overcoming the previous two&#8208;carbon limit of base&#8208;mediated processes.

         <title>Unraveling CO&#8208;Tolerance Mechanism in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells via Operando Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operando transmission infrared spectroscopic method was developed for real&#8208;time monitoring fuel cell processes. By this method, CO adsorption dynamics and poisoning mechanisms on commercial PtRu/C catalysts were elucidated under fuel cell operando environments for the first time. Beyond the classical bifunctional mechanism, we identified a new CO tolerance pathway involving CO migration from Pt to Ru sites, thereby liberating highly active Pt sites for sustained hydrogen oxidation activity.








Abstract
CO poisoning remains a critical challenge for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Current studies of CO tolerance primarily focus on solid/liquid interfaces (in situ conditions), which differ significantly from PEMFCs' solid/liquid/gas triple&#8208;phase interfaces (operando conditions) in microenvironment and mass transport. Herein, we developed an operando transmission infrared spectroscopy method that enables direct observation of CO tolerance mechanism on commercial PtRu/C catalysts in PEMFCs. Under in situ conditions, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity is governed by CO mass transfer, and is insensitive to the availability of active sites, while it is highly sensitive under operando conditions due to enhanced mass transfer, thereby aggravating CO poisoning effects. Notably, 76% of HOR activity can recover upon switching to pure H2. Based on CO band evolution, we proposed a new pathway beyond the traditional bifunctional mechanism of CO tolerance: CO migrates from Pt to Ru sites, undergoing oxidation at potentials as low as 0.01&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

         <title>Leveraging Polaron Effect for Solar&#8208;Driven Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface electron polaron&#8208;modified Cu1&#8211;Ov/TiO2 with optimized electron transfer performance was formed. Under illumination, with the help of photogenerated electrons and polaron hopping, a record photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction rate constant was reached through an efficient radical&#8208;dominated pathway, which realized a balance between cost and efficiency, favorable for promising PMS applications.








Abstract
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) represents a promising advanced oxidation technique for the treatment of refractory pollutants; however, its application is limited by high costs resulting from excessive usage due to low activation efficiency. In this study, we formulated a sunlight&#8208;driven Cu1&#8211;Ov/TiO2 catalyst with surface electron polaron sites to activate PMS for the degradation of contaminants, achieving a record reaction rate of k&#160;=&#160;2.998&#160;min&#8722;1 even with a low PMS dosage of 0.3&#160;mM. The adsorption process and electron transfer kinetics were significantly enhanced with surface polaron sites in Cu1&#8211;Ov/TiO2, which facilitated the activation of PMS and increased the reaction rate constant k by 29.1 times compared with that of TiO2/PMS under illumination. Additionally, we verified that light irradiation promotes transfer from the non&#8208;free&#8208;radical pathway to the efficient free&#8208;radical pathway in mechanism of PMS activation. Our designed sunlight&#8208;driven flow&#8208;through PMS setup achieves a removal rate exceeding 90% for 7 days of outdoor operation at 3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, the feasibility of which is further proven in regions around the world by analysis of solar intensity. This study presents a demonstration of economical PMS application in water purification worldwide, with an estimated cost of 0.135&#160;$&#160;m&#8722;3.

         <title>First Encapsulation of Organometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet into Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>

Encapsulating chemically unstable organometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes not only improves their chemical stability but also suppresses magnetic relaxation at zero magnetic fields, greatly improving their usability, which is essential for fabricating spintronic devices.








Abstract
An air&#8208;sensitive DyCp3 (Cp&#8722;&#160;= cyclopentadienyl) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) complex (1) is encapsulated into single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to construct hybrid materials that are resistant to moisture and oxygen. The hybrid materials with independent slow&#8208;magnetic&#8208;relaxing centers are expected to become a key component of the next generation of information process devices based on spintronics. The resilience to moisture and oxygen further broadens its manufacturing methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, upon encapsulation into SWCNTs, DyCp3 exhibited clear ac frequency dependence in the ac magnetic susceptibility at a zero&#8208;dc field. This indicates that the guest molecule's slow magnetic relaxation properties are preserved, which is crucial and necessary to realize SMMs&#8208;based quantum information processing, by allowing a sufficient time window for quantum gate operations. This result exemplifies that encapsulation of air&#8208;sensitive organometallic SMMs into SWCNTs enhances their chemical stability and their magnetic relaxation time at a zero&#8208;dc magnetic field, which provides a novel method for their further applications.

         <title>Management of Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions in Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular planarity, crystallization behavior and stacking orientation, as well as film morphology of hole transport materials (HTMs) can be regulated by constructing different noncovalent conformational locks. The use of TzTzTPA&#8208;NH, with its intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as a dopant&#8208;free HTM affords excellent PCEs of 24.2% for single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and 25.4% for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs).








Abstract
Organic semiconductors with intramolecular noncovalent interactions are promising hole transport materials (HTMs) for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the effects of different types of noncovalent bonds on the properties of HTMs are rarely reported. Here, three thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (TzTz)&#8208;based HTMs with different side chains were developed. Compared with alkyl side chains, functional side chains can improve the crystallinity and charge transport ability of HTMs by forming intramolecular noncovalent interactions. However, the steric hindrance of S&#183;&#183;&#183;O in TzTzTPA&#8208;SO distorted the molecular skeleton, leading to edge&#8208;on stacking and local aggregation of film. Fortunately, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH with intramolecular hydrogen bond showed high planarity, proper crystallinity, and preferred stacking orientation. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2% with a nice long&#8208;term stability was achieved by dopant&#8208;free TzTzTPA&#8208;NH&#8208;based PSCs, which is superior to the doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based PSCs. In addition, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH is well used as HTM in wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Encouragingly, the TSCs based on TzTzTPA&#8208;NH achieved an excellent PCE of 25.4%, which is the highest PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite/organic TSCs. This work clearly illustrates the effect of intramolecular noncovalent interactions on the properties of HTMs, and provides guidance for designing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs in PSCs.

Here, three thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz)-based HTMs with different side chains were developed. Compared with alkyl side chains, functional side chains can improve the crystallinity and charge transport ability of HTMs by forming intramolecular noncovalent interactions. However, the steric hindrance of S&#183;&#183;&#183;O in TzTzTPA-SO distorted the molecular skeleton, leading to edge-on stacking and local aggregation of film. Fortunately, TzTzTPA-NH with intramolecular hydrogen bond showed high planarity, proper crystallinity, and preferred stacking orientation. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2% with a nice long-term stability was achieved by dopant-free TzTzTPA-NH-based PSCs, which is superior to the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. In addition, TzTzTPA-NH is well used as HTM in wide-bandgap PSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Encouragingly, the TSCs based on TzTzTPA-NH achieved an excellent PCE of 25.4%, which is the highest PCE of n-i-p perovskite/organic TSCs. This work clearly illustrates the effect of intramolecular noncovalent interactions on the properties of HTMs, and provides guidance for designing high-performance dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Buried Interface/Bulk Synergistic Passivation via Chlorophyll Derivative for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the ultra&#8208;high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, a portion of the chlorophyll derivative molecules that would be passivating nickel oxide diffuse into the perovskite with the perovskite precursor, thus achieving a buried interface/bulk synergistic passivation of perovskite films.








Abstract
Buried interfacial engineering is crucial for NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while most passivation measures focus only on the interface and neglect the perovskite bulk. In this work, a stable free&#8208;base chlorin possessing an amino acid terminal (serinyl pyropheophorbide&#8208;a, SPPa) was synthesized as a functional chlorophyll derivative, and its trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen chloride salts (SPPaX; X&#160;=&#160;TFA, HCl) were introduced into the NiOx/perovskite interface. Thanks to the high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, SPPaX can diffuse into the perovskite through the precursor. Insertion of SPPaX optimizes the interfacial energy band bending and minimizes interfacial defects, while the growth sites provided by SPPaX facilitate the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite film with less lattice strain and high crystal orientation. Additionally, diffused SPPaX molecules in perovskite improve the crystallization process and decrease the internal defects of perovskite films. As a result, the SPPaX distributed throughout perovskite achieves a bulk/interface synergistic passivation effect at both the bulk and buried interface of the perovskite film. SPPaTFA&#8208;modified PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.54% with a superior long&#8208;term stability under both light and thermal stress.

         <title>Constructing Biomimetic Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthesis for Enhanced Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton transport in biological systems relies on amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acids as proton donors and acceptors. Here, we first demonstrate that post&#8208;synthesis can create unoccupied carboxylic acid groups in HOFs, stabilizing water molecules and forming continuous proton channels. This strategy achieves 1000&#8208;fold enhancement in proton conductivity and the structure transformation was clearly revealed by crystallography.








Abstract
Proton transport channels in biological systems are constructed by the specific amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acid groups acting as proton donors and acceptors, enabling rapid proton conduction via the Grotthuss mechanism. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising candidates for artificially simulating proton channels due to their designable structure and abundant proton sources in the network. However, these protons were usually immobilized within hydrogen bonds between two building blocks, which require a high energy barrier for initiating proton transport. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) may be a viable solution to the above problems but has yet to be achieved in HOFs. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that unoccupied carboxylic acid groups can be created through post&#8208;synthesis which further stabilizes water molecules to construct continuous proton channels, bringing boosted proton conductivity by three orders of magnitude. The structure transformation process and the intermediate can be identified clearly by crystallography with an unveiled mechanism. This work offers a new approach to constructing biomimetic channels for proton conduction and HOF functionalization.

         <title>Imaging Heterogeneous Patterns of Aminopeptidase N Activity in Hierarchical Tissue Structures Through High&#8208;Resolution Whole&#8208;Organ 3D Mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

Enzymes regulate physiological functions, and their abnormal activity is associated with diseases. Here, we present a method for high&#8208;resolution 3D mapping of enzyme activity using tissue clearing and an activity&#8208;based covalent probe. Focusing on aminopeptidase N, we developed ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY, which records enzyme activity via covalent labeling. This enables whole&#8208;organ imaging, revealing activity heterogeneity and inhibitor effects.








Abstract
Enzymes play a crucial role in regulating physiological functions, and abnormal enzyme activity is associated with various pathological conditions. Precise imaging of enzyme activity in tissues, providing detailed spatial and quantitative information, advances our understanding of physiological and pathological processes. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of methods for high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging of enzyme activity across entire tissues. In this research, we report a methodology for high&#8208;resolution, whole&#8208;organ 3D mapping of enzyme activity, which combines tissue clearing with an activity&#8208;based covalent chemical probe. Focusing on aminopeptidase N (APN) as a representative target of peptidase, we developed ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY, an activity&#8208;based covalent fluorescent probe compatible with tissue clearing for imaging APN activity. Upon activation by APN, ANA&#8208;o&#8208;BODIPY produces a reactive intermediate, aza&#8208;quinone methide, which covalently binds to proximal proteins. This covalent probe is successfully utilized to record the location of APN activity during the tissue&#8208;clearing process. By combining the probe with tissue clearing, we have achieved high&#8208;resolution 3D mapping of APN activity across whole organs for the first time. Moreover, this advancement allowed us to visualize the heterogeneity of APN activity in individual tubular structures and to uncover the inhibitory effects of different APN inhibitors.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the gardeners trimming branches and theoretical guidance, a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy is proposed and applied to obtain a series of atomic clusters catalysts with wide range of Cl coordination number (CN). Particularly, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). Additionally, the strategy helps us to establish the inverted volcano relationship between the CN and catalytic activity. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.








Abstract
The coordination number (CN) in atomic cluster (AC) catalysts endows their catalytic performance with flexible tunability. However, the quantitative relationship between the CN and catalytic activity of atomic cluster catalysts remains ambiguity. Herein, inspired by the gardeners trimming plants branches to obtain ornamental value shape, we propose a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy to obtain a series of AC catalysts with wide range of Cl CN and establish an inverted volcano curve to explain the effect of CN on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). This proposed synthesis strategy fully utilizes the precursor atoms and is widely applicable. The reaction liquid can be reused up to 20 times to obtain 1130&#160;mg catalysts without introducing any other chemicals. Additionally, theoretical calculations highlight the appropriate Cl CN benefits the HER on Pt2 ACs. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Single Atom Copper Catalyst as a Redox Mediator in the Cathodic Reduction of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom copper catalyst (Cu&#8208;N3P1@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro reduction as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect. 








Abstract
The use of clean electric energy to activate inert compounds has garnered significant attention. Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) in organic electrosynthesis are effective platforms for this purpose. However, understanding the RM's electronic structure under operational conditions, electron transport processes at the electrode surface, and substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics remains challenging. Here, we synthesized a Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC, named Cu&#9472;N&#9472;P@NC) with a CuN3P1 micro&#8208;coordination structure, employing it as a unique cathode redox mediator. Introducing phosphine atoms into the coordination system allowed modulation of the SAC's electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, optimizing catalyst&#8208;substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics and accelerating electrochemical reactions. Utilizing the heterogeneous SAC strategy, we achieved a novel electro&#8208;reduction coupling ring&#8208;opening reaction of inert quinazolinone frameworks. The Cu&#8208;SAC exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity and substrate compatibility, operating smoothly at gram&#8208;scale production. Additionally, we applied the SAC to modify 11 natural product molecules. Integrating micro&#8208;coordination environment regulation and theoretical adsorption models elucidated the significant influence of electrode&#8208;RMs&#8208;substrate interactions on reaction kinetics and catalytic efficiency&#8208;a feat challenging for homogeneous RMs. This approach offers a novel pathway for advancing efficient organic electrosynthesis reactions and provides critical insights for mechanistic studies.

         <title>Metalized Porphyrin&#8208;Based COFs for Conductive Porous Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells to Enhance Electron Injection, Defect Passivation, and Lead&#8208;Protection</title>

Cu2+&#8208;loaded metalized porphyrin&#8208;based COF (Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF) enhances electron transport and perovskite film quality, leading to improved carrier extraction and defect passivation, achieving an efficiency of 25.41% and maintaining excellent stability under various environments.








Abstract
In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the introduction of an intermediate layer to bridge the transport and photoactive layers has become a key strategy for enhancing carrier extraction efficiency. However, traditional approaches are often limited by the seesaw effect, making it challenging to achieve an optimal balance between electron transport and defect passivation. In this study, we employed a Cu2+&#8208;loaded metalized porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF) as a conductive porous layer (CPL) at the perovskite bottom interface. Experimental results showed that a Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF coverage of 19% significantly enhanced electron transport and effectively suppressed long&#8208;distance electron diffusion. Moreover, the carefully designed Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF provided abundant active sites, which improved the film&#8208;forming quality of the perovskite layer, thereby facilitating the beneficial synergy of electron injection and defect passivation. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% (0.09&#160;cm2) and 21.99% (1.01&#160;cm2). Using Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF to stabilize the perovskite crystal structure, the unencapsulated devices retained over 81% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h. Additionally, Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF effectively chelated lead ions and thus enhanced the environmental sustainability of PSCs.

         <title>Exploring Secondary Electrostatic Interactions Using Molecular Rotors: Implications for SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study experimentally tests the role of secondary electrostatic interactions in SN2 reactions using molecular rotors. Lower rotational barriers for sp2/sp carbons align with faster SN2 rates, isolating these effects from conjugation. The results reveal electrostatic interactions as a key factor, confirmed across diverse atoms like O, S, and N. 








Abstract
Benzylic and allylic electrophiles are well known to react faster in SN2 reactions than aliphatic electrophiles, but the origins of this enhanced reactivity are still being debated. Galabov, Wu, and Allen recently proposed that electrostatic interactions in the transition state between the nucleophile (Nu) and the sp2 carbon (C2) adjacent to the electrophilic carbon (C1) play a key role. To test this secondary electrostatic hypothesis, molecular rotors were designed that form similar through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions with C2 in their bond rotation transition states without forming bonds to C1. This largely eliminates the alternative explanation of stabilizing conjugation effects between C1 and C2 in the transition state. The rotor barriers were strongly correlated with the experimentally measured SN2 free energy. Notably, rotors where C2 was sp2 or sp&#8208;hybridized had barriers that were consistently 0.5&#8211;2.0&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 lower than those for rotors where C2 was sp3&#8208;hybridized. Computational studies of atomic charges were consistent with the formation of stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions. Further confirmation came from observing the benzylic effect in rotors where the first atom was varied, including oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and sp2&#8208;carbon. In summary, these studies provided strong experimental support for the role of secondary electrostatic interactions in the SN2 reaction.

         <title>Auxiliary Ligand&#8208;Coordinated Nanoconfined Hydrophobic Microenvironments in Nickel(II)&#8211;Acetylide Framework for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiII&#8211;acetylide framework, TPA&#8208;Ni(PBu3)2&#8208;GY, demonstrates exceptional performance in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Synergistic effects, including d&#8211;p orbital overlap between NiII and alkynyl carbon atoms (&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;NiII(PBu3)2&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;), a &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic moiety, and an auxiliary coordinated ligand tributylphosphine&#8208;derived hydrophobic nanoconfined space around NiII sites, facilitate electron transfer, CO2 activation, intermediate stabilization, and suppressed hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;acetylide frameworks (MAFs), featuring metal&#8208;bis(acetylide) linkages (&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;M&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;), are emerging as a new class of 2D nanomaterials with promise in catalysis. Here, we report a new 2D NiII&#8211;acetylide framework, TPA&#8208;Ni(PR3)2&#8208;GYs, that incorporates the NiII(PR3)2 moiety [R&#160;=&#160;CH3 (Me), CH2CH3 (Et), and CH2CH2CH2CH3 (Bu)] into tris(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)amine&#8208;based graphdiyne framework (TPA&#8208;GDY). As a result, TPA&#8208;Ni(PBu3)2&#8208;GY exhibits an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of 3807&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a high selectivity of 99.4% for CO production upon visible light irradiation.&#160;Mechanistic investigations reveal a strong orbital matching effect between the d orbitals of NiII and the p orbitals of the alkynyl C atoms in organic ligands, which not only accelerates the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers but also reduces the reaction potential barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediates. Furthermore, the high hydrophobicity of the auxiliary coordinated ligands (trialkylphosphines) to Ni center, particularly tributylphosphine, creates a nanoconfined space that enhances both the accessibility of CO2 and the utilization of NiII catalytic active sites while inhibiting hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the benefit of modulating the microenvironment around the coordinated metal center to enhance the performance of catalysts with direct metal&#8211;acetylide bonding.

As a result, TPA-Ni(PBu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-GY exhibits an exceptional photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity of 3807&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high selectivity of 99.4% for CO production upon visible light irradiation.&#160;Mechanistic investigations reveal a strong orbital matching effect between the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of the alkynyl C atoms in organic ligands, which not only accelerates the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers but also reduces the reaction potential barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediates. Furthermore, the high hydrophobicity of the auxiliary coordinated ligands (trialkylphosphines) to Ni center, particularly tributylphosphine, creates a nanoconfined space that enhances both the accessibility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the utilization of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic active sites while inhibiting hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the benefit of modulating the microenvironment around the coordinated metal center to enhance the performance of catalysts with direct metal&#8211;acetylide bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Environments Enable Metal Surface&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoNiMnMoPd high entropy alloy (HEA) was synthesized, which effectively stabilized Ni&#948;+ to achieve high FDCA FE, HMF conversion rate, and FDCA selectivity for the efficient electrooxidation of HMF, with corresponding values of 92.5%, 89.5%, and 95.8%, respectively.








Abstract
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable route to diverse products, minimizing environmental impact. However, conventional 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electrooxidation (HMFOR) catalysts such as Ni(OH)&#8322; and NiS suffer from low conductivity, poor stability, and limited active sites. This work introduces a CoNiMnMoPd high entropy alloy (HEA) to address these limitations by simultaneously maintaining high conductivity, stability, and a high Ni oxidation state, enabling nucleophilic dehydrogenation. The HEA catalyst achieved a 92.5% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) Faradaic efficiency, 89.5% HMF conversion, and 95.8% FDCA selectivity, maintaining performance for over 100 h. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the multielement composition of the HEA enabled Ni sites to maintain a high&#8208;valence state, serving as the primary adsorption sites for HMF, and the dehydrogenation reaction occurs preferentially at non&#8208;Ni sites within the HEA. Compared to monometallic Ni, the d&#8208;band center shift and reduced antibonding filling contributed to a decrease in the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA conversion, from 0.770 to 0.567&#160;eV. This work offers novel insights for the development of Ni&#8208;based HEA catalysts for biomass valorization.

         <title>Strategy Formulation for Mitigating Capacity Fading of Na&#8208;Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use commercial NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 cathode as an analysis object. The underlying mechanism for the capacity fading of NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322; full cells is deeply understood. We established screening criteria for electrolyte additives that improve capacity retention. A new compound, C6H18NNaSi2, is selected to greatly enhance the electrochemical performance. This could in turn drive the commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. 








Abstract
The mechanisms underlying capacity fading during cycling in layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries remain inadequately understood. It is essential to elucidate the reasons and propose effective strategies. Here, the capacity&#8208;fading mechanism of commercial NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 is due to the dissolution of iron ions. Additionally, the extraction of sodium ions (after the Fe3+/Fe4+ reaction) lowers the energy level of NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322; below that of the electrolyte solvent, thereby inducing solvent decomposition. We establish screening criteria for electrolyte additives through theoretical calculations to improve capacity retention. We identified a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing Lewis base additives that can kinetically bind efficiently to iron ions in NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322; and thermodynamically exhibit stronger electron&#8208;donating abilities than the solvents. A new compound, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (which has not been studied as a Na&#8208;ion battery additive before), is selected through the Reaxys database (out of 61 molecules) because it is commercially available at a low price and is relatively stable in the electrochemical process. Such an additive is demonstrated to greatly improve the Coulombic efficiency and reduce the dissolution of iron ions of NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322;//hard carbon cells.

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off of RuO2 via Metallic Ru Bilateral Regulation for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
RuO2 electrocatalysts, which followed a kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism, perform a preferable intrinsic activity, but poor stability for acidic oxygen evolution. This work offer a strategy which introduce metallic Ru onto RuO2 to build the Ru4+&#9472;O&#9472;Ru0 interfacial structure for decreasing the Ru4+ oxidation state and promoting deprotonation kinetic, thus balancing the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution. 








Abstract
Developing highly efficient acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. RuO2 electrocatalysts, which followed a kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism, perform a preferable intrinsic activity, but poor stability for acidic OER. Recent work often sacrifices the intrinsic activity of RuO2 to enhance stability. The balance between the activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based catalysts is still overlooked in current research. Here, we report a controlled method to introduce metallic Ru onto RuO2 catalysts to form the Ru4+&#9472;O&#9472;Ru0 interfacial structure for decreasing the Ru4+ oxidation state and promoting deprotonation kinetics. Metallic Ru can serve as the electron donor to lower the oxidation state of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722; in Ru/RuO2 for stabilizing the structure of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722;&#8208;Ru/RuO2 to favour the acidic OER stability. Moreover, the deprotonation kinetics via the interfacial oxygen site between Ru4+ and Ru0 is significantly enhanced on Ru/RuO2 catalysts to improve the acidic OER activity. This work offers a unique perspective to balance the acidic OER activity and stability of RuO2.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering and Structural Modulation of RuO2&#8208;Based Catalysts for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions is key to commercializing green hydrogen production via water splitting.  Here, we fabricated a cobalt oxide (Co3O4)&#8208;synergised nickel&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (Ni&#8208;RuO2) heterojunction on reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes. The interface of Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2 heterojunction and doping of Ni into RuO2, as well as their effect on electronic structure, were examined by advanced characterizations. With only 1.36 wt% RuO2, the Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO heterojunction revealed an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 195 and 305 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst's performance was well maintained after operating for 100 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2, suggesting great promise for practical applications. Density functional theory calculations and in&#8208;situ Raman analysis indicate that both the heterojunction structure and Ni doping play crucial roles in enhancing the OER activity and durability.

Here, we fabricated a cobalt oxide (Co3O4)-synergised nickel-doped ruthenium oxide (Ni-RuO2) heterojunction on reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/Ni-RuO2/rGO) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes. The interface of Co3O4/Ni-RuO2 heterojunction and doping of Ni into RuO2, as well as their effect on electronic structure, were examined by advanced characterizations. With only 1.36 wt% RuO2, the Co3O4/Ni-RuO2/rGO heterojunction revealed an ultra-low overpotential of 195 and 305 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst's performance was well maintained after operating for 100 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2, suggesting great promise for practical applications. Density functional theory calculations and in-situ Raman analysis indicate that both the heterojunction structure and Ni doping play crucial roles in enhancing the OER activity and durability. This study provides a promising avenue for developing cost-effective electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability for advanced energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activated Orthogonal Proteolysis Chimeras for Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

We present a novel tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme&#8208;activated clickable PROTACs, enabling the in&#8197;situ formation of heterobifunctional degraders to disrupt epigenetic BRD4 proteins in the tumor only. Such clickable&#8208;PROTACs exhibit promising selectivity and superior penetration in tumors, effectively downregulating PD&#8722;L1 expression both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, offering potential for immunotherapy against tumor growth.







Abstract
Precise modulation of dynamic and complex tumor microenvironment (TME) to disrupt tumorigenesis and reshape intratumoral immune infiltration has emerged as promising approaches for enhanced cancer therapy. Among recent innovations, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a burgeoning chemical knockdown technology capable of degrading oncogenic protein homeostasis and inducing dynamic alternations within carcinoma settings, offering potential for antitumor manipulation. However, achieving selectivity in PROTACs that respond to disease environmental stimulation and precisely perturb on&#8208;target proteins remains challenging. The multi&#8208;step synthesis and limited permeability, attributed to high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight and heterobifunctional structures, further hinder their in&#8197;vivo efficacy. Herein, we present a unique TME&#8208;responsive enzyme&#8208;activated clickable PROTACs, which features a short peptide&#8208;tagged pomalidomide derivative to undergo tumor&#8208;specific cleavage by cathepsin protease to induce orthogonal crosslinking of the exposed cysteine with 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;labeled epigenetic protein&#8208;ligand JQ1, facilitating in&#8197;situ degrader formation within tumor regions only. Systematic protein profiling and proteomic analysis revealed that such TME&#8208;specific clickable&#8208;PROTACs not only selectively eliminate epigenetic proteins without tedious pre&#8208;synthesis to bridge disparate small&#8208;molecule bi&#8208;warhead fragments, but also demonstrated superior tumor penetration compared to conventional high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PROTACs. Importantly, these clickable&#8208;PROTACs efficiently downregulated immune checkpoint programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, remodeling TME for enhanced therapeutics, especially in anti&#8208;tumoral immunomodulation.

         <title>Photoredox Autocatalysis: Towards a Library of Generally Applicable Sulfonamide Reductive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox autocatalysis is revealed to access cyclic biaryl sulfonamides (BASNs) without an initial exogenous photocatalyst. While unveiling photoredox autocatalysis is important to the enrichment of basic research, this has also led to further practical applications such as rapid discovery of novel, potent and readily accessible photocatalyst scaffolds, BASNs, which catalyze manifolds of meaningful transformations.







Abstract
Dichotomous thinking dominates the field of synthetic photochemistry&#8212;either a reaction needs a photocatalyst or not. Herein, we report the identification of a photoredox autocatalytic pathway &#8208; an alternative to the existing mechanistic paradigms &#8208; to access cyclic biaryl sulfonamides (BASNs). This reaction does not require exogenous catalyst as the visible light absorbing deprotonated product &#8208; with potent excited state reductive power &#8208; acts as the photocatalyst for its own synthesis. This finding implicated BASN as a novel organophotocatalyst architecture and allowed a rapid, modular, and low&#8208;cost combinatorial synthesis of a BASN library that expedited optimal photocatalyst screening. Furthermore, BASN was revealed as a widely applicable organophotocatalyst for diverse transition metal&#8208;free transformations such as: intramolecular (spiro)&#8208;cyclizations, defunctionalizations, and C&#8722;C / C&#8208;heteroatom couplings.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D Linear Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thermal aggregation, disordered linear polymers are transformed into ordered 2D trapezoidal polymers, which provide migration pathways for ion diffusion, thereby accelerating ion transport. Moreover, thanks to the high ion diffusion, the capacity remains largely unaffected even when the loading increases (from 1 to 6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, benefiting from the exceptionally large conjugated structure, its electrochemical stability is significantly enhanced.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional structure of cathode materials possesses fast kinetics in aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, in organic linear polymers it is rare to form two&#8208;dimensional structures due to the bond rotations of the polymerization reaction. In this work, inspired by the process of forming carbon fibers from polyacrylonitrile, a novel two&#8208;dimensional linear polymer (2DLP) of poly(2H,11H&#8208;bis[l,4]triazino[3,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;m]triphenodithiazine&#8208;3,12&#8208;diyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diyli&#8208;dene&#8208;11,12&#8208;bis[methyldene]) (PTL) cathode materials were prepared for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials by designing ladder structure polymer molecules with highly restricted bond rotations. PTL possess fast cations diffusion (4.27&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) due to its layered structure. Moreover, the PTL electrodes exhibit an ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (7000&#8197;cycles still remain 87&#8201;% capacity remains). Meanwhile, as PTL mass loading increase from 3.13 to 6.27&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the specific capacity kept 98&#8201;% retention after 100&#8197;cycles. Besides, the assembled Zn/PTL flexible pack battery exhibits a 6.6&#8197;mAh capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, though a range of ex site analysis, it was supported that the charge storage mechanism of PTL is driven by the imine moiety, and accompanies by the insertion and extraction of Zn2+/H+ ions. This work attempts to provide a new sight of improve the poor ion diffusion coefficient of organic materials.

         <title>Enhancing the Reversibility and Kinetics of Heterovalent Ion&#8208;Substituted Mn&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogue Cathodes via Intervalence Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions in the design of Prussian blue analogues (PBA) cathodes for SIBs is verified and series of novel V3+&#8208;substituted MnPBA are successfully prepared. The optimized Na1.2V0.63Mn0.58Fe(CN)6 cathode demonstrates incredible rate capability (94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and remarkable long&#8208;cycle stability, surpassing the majority of reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes.







Abstract
Mn3+ (d4) in manganese&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) exhibits intrinsic orbital degeneracy upon sodiation/desodiation, resulting in severe Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, which usually causes rapid capacity decay and sluggish kinetics. Unfortunately, traditional modification strategies are insufficient for electronic tuning of Mn3+ to mitigate these issues. Herein, Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions is unraveled in a series of novel V3+&#8208;substituted MnPBA to enhance electrochemical reaction reversibility and kinetics. IVCT drives electron distribution from localized to delocalized, achieves electronic coupling, and mitigates Jahn&#8211;Teller by transferring a single&#8208;electron of Mn3+ eg orbital. Notably, the reported Na1.2V0.63Mn0.58Fe(CN)6 cathode demonstrates excellent rate capability (136.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), remarkable long&#8208;cycle stability (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 90.7&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and robust performance across a wide temperature range (98.59&#8201;% capacity after 300 cycles at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), surpassing the majority of reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes. The intrinsic functioning mechanism of IVCT and quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism were adequately understood through systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study further develops electron&#8208;tuning of PBA, opening a new avenue toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials.

The optimized Na&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;0.63&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode demonstrates incredible rate capability (94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and remarkable long-cycle stability, surpassing the majority of reported sodium-ion cathodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) in manganese-based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) exhibits intrinsic orbital degeneracy upon sodiation/desodiation, resulting in severe Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, which usually causes rapid capacity decay and sluggish kinetics. Unfortunately, traditional modification strategies are insufficient for electronic tuning of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to mitigate these issues. Herein, Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions is unraveled in a series of novel V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-substituted MnPBA to enhance electrochemical reaction reversibility and kinetics. IVCT drives electron distribution from localized to delocalized, achieves electronic coupling, and mitigates Jahn&#8211;Teller by transferring a single-electron of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital. Notably, the reported Na&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;0.63&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode demonstrates excellent rate capability (136.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), remarkable long-cycle stability (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 90.7&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and robust performance across a wide temperature range (98.59&#8201;% capacity after 300 cycles at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), surpassing the majority of reported sodium-ion cathodes. The intrinsic functioning mechanism of IVCT and quasi-zero-strain reaction mechanism were adequately understood through systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study further develops electron-tuning of PBA, opening a new avenue toward advanced sodium-ion battery cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Probes for Cellular Imaging of G&#8208;quadruplexes: Beyond Fluorescence Intensity Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA can fold into tetra&#8208;stranded helical structures known as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). There is mounting evidence suggesting that these structures have important biological roles. In this minireview we discuss advances in the design of optical probes for the detection of G4s that offer intensity&#8208;independent readouts that address limitations of conventional fluorescence intensity&#8208;based probes.








Abstract
The study of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures that form in DNA and RNA is a rapidly growing field, which has evolved from in vitro studies of isolated G4 sequences to genome&#8208;wide detection of G4s in a cellular context. This work has revealed the tangible and significant effects that G4s may have on biological regulation. This minireview describes recent progress in the design of photoluminescent intensity&#8208;independent optical probes for G4s. We discuss the design and use of probes based on fluorescence or phosphorescence lifetime, rather than intensity&#8208;based detection; spectral ratiometric probes; and fluorescent probes for single&#8208;molecule G4&#8208;detection. We argue that each of these modalities improve unbiased G4 detection in cellular experiments, overcoming problems associated with unknown cellular uptake of probes or their organelle concentration. We discuss the improvements offered by these types of probes, as well as limitations and future research directions needed to facilitate more robust research into G4 biology.

         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the design, synthesis, and mRNA delivery properties of one&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), with particular focus on their organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers including core&#8208;shell and dendron&#8208;tail dendrimers for RNA delivery have also been reviewed, demonstrating the versatility of dendrimer&#8208;type delivery carriers for RNA&#8208;related therapeutics.








Abstract
mRNA nanomedicine represents a new generation of therapeutics. However, how to deliver mRNA to the desired organs and cells effectively remains challenging. Common mRNA delivery vectors include viral and nonviral types such as four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles, lipid&#8208;polymer hybrid nanoparticles, and so on. One&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), are an emerging type of mRNA delivery vehicle displaying good stability and high delivery efficiency. In this review, we comprehensively present the design, synthesis, and mRNA delivery properties of IAJDs, with particular focus on the relationship between their molecular structures and organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers for RNA delivery are also reviewed. Overall, this review summarizes the recent research progress on IAJDs systematically, aiming to guide the development of more efficient mRNA delivery platforms and next&#8208;generation mRNA nanomedicines.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Low&#8208;Temperature Upcycling of Waste Polyolefins via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of recent advances in mild catalytic transformations of polyolefins, emphasizing the kinetic and thermodynamic interplay between endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavages and the exothermic formation of new C&#9472;H, C&#9472;C, and C&#9472;O bonds. The aim is to identify existing challenges and potential routes for catalytic conversions that reduce energy consumption and carbon footprints. 








Abstract
Polyolefin waste is the largest polymer waste stream that could potentially serve as an advantageous hydrocarbon feedstock. Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400&#160;&#176;C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. We summarize and critically compare recent advances in upgrading spent polyolefins and model reactants via kinetic (and thermodynamic) coupling of the endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavage of polyolefins with exothermic reactions including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, cyclization, oxidation, and alkylation. These approaches enable complete conversion to desired products at low temperatures (&lt;300&#160;&#176;C). The goal is to identify challenges and possible pathways for catalytic conversions that minimize energy and carbon footprints.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyolefin waste is the largest polymer waste stream that could potentially serve as an advantageous hydrocarbon feedstock. Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400&#160;&#176;C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. We summarize and critically compare recent advances in upgrading spent polyolefins and model reactants via kinetic (and thermodynamic) coupling of the endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavage of polyolefins with exothermic reactions including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, cyclization, oxidation, and alkylation. These approaches enable complete conversion to desired products at low temperatures (&amp;lt;300&#160;&#176;C). The goal is to identify challenges and possible pathways for catalytic conversions that minimize energy and carbon footprints.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Online Coupling High&#8208;Temperature Electrolysis with Carbonylation Reactions: A Powerful Method for Continuous Carbon Dioxide Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous process for carbonylation reactions based on the online coupling of dry, high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis with a coil reactor has been reported. The strategy relies on producing CO/CO2 mixtures onsite, without H2 or H2O entering the product gas, thus providing a safe and fast concept for the synthesis of several carbonyl compounds. The method demonstrated widespread applicability in amino&#8208;, alkoxy&#8208;, and phenoxycarbonylation, in carbonylative Sonogashira couplings, and in the synthesis of redox&#8208;active esters. The corresponding products were isolated with excellent yields in just 40 min.








Abstract
Despite being widely available, the broad utilization of CO2 for chemical production remains in its infancy. The difficulty of using CO2 as an important resource for the chemical industry lies in the high stability of the molecule and its associated inertia. In this work, we demonstrate how to overcome these limitations by utilizing a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) with an optimized cathode to produce dry CO through the high&#8208;temperature electrolysis of CO2. We further integrate this process with a synthesis setup in a continuous&#8208;flow coil reactor to boost reactivity in various carbonylation processes, including in amino&#8208;, alkoxy&#8208;, and phenoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira couplings, or the synthesis of redox&#8208;active esters. Ultimately, our approach offers a platform strategy for the rapid, scalable, and continuous production of carbonyl compounds directly from CO2 while eliminating the requirement for storing large CO quantities.

         <title>Role of Interfacial Water in Improving the Activity and Stability of Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Acidic Oxygen Evolution on RuO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;H2O&#8208;enriched local environment is conducive to reducing the energy barrier of interfacial water dissociation, realizing the continuous supply of the available reactants, and leading to the dynamic balance between consumption and replenishment for lattice oxygen atoms in RuS0.45Ox.








Abstract
Although RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely studied for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), triggering the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism to suppress kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway at the expense of activity is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy. To date, approaches to simultaneously achieve remarkable activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts through the kinetically favorable LOM pathway toward acidic OER are still elusive. Herein, we report that RuS0.45Ox catalyst with the synergetic regulation of asymmetric S&#8211;Ru&#8211;O microstructure and Ru&#8211;SO4 local environments can simultaneously boost the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated OER activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. Experimental results, including operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, operando X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical studies, indicate the dynamic evolution of interfacial water structure from hydrogen&#8208;bond water to free&#8208;H2O on the surface of RuS0.45Ox. The generated continuous free&#8208;H2O&#8208;enriched local environment is in favor of accelerating the sluggish kinetics of interfacial water dissociation and facilitating the replenishment of lattice oxygen vacancies generated during the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated OER process, thereby significantly enhancing the stability. Consequently, the obtained RuS0.45Ox displays remarkable acidic OER performance with 160&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and robust stability with negligible activity decay over 500 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Amphiphilic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework for Improved CO2 Separation in PIM&#8208;1 Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improvement in compatibility between filler ZIF&#8208;94 and polymer PIM&#8208;1 in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) was achieved through ligand exchange with undecylimidazole (umIm). The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) presents amphiphilic character and high CO2 adsorption (2.34&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 90&#160;kPa and 0 &#176;C). The MMM with 5&#160;wt.% loading showed a 70% increase in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and 10% higher CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2) compared to pure PIM&#8208;1 membranes.








Abstract
This study aims to enhance the compatibility between filler and polymer in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), addressing an important challenge in membrane development. ZIF&#8208;94, known for its affinity to CO2, was partially modified with 2&#8208;undecylimidazolate (umIm) through the solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method to improve its compatibility with the prototypical polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM&#8208;1. The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) can be considered as an amphiphilic MOF with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, while maintaining a considerably high CO2 adsorption capacity (2.34&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 90&#160;kPa and 0&#160;&#176;C). Gas separation experiments were performed using mixed gas compositions of 15/85 CO2/N2 at 3&#160;bar and 35 &#176;C. The resulting MMM with a 5&#160;wt.% loading exhibited an enhanced CO2 separation performance, with ca. 70% and 10% increases in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2), respectively, compared to pristine PIM&#8208;1 membranes. In addition, thin film nanocomposite membranes were prepared showing a 23.5 CO2/N2 selectivity at 2350 GPU of CO2. This modification strategy shows a great potential for improving the CO2 capture technologies, highlighting the potential of tailoring MOF fillers for advanced membrane materials in gas separation applications.

The modified ZIF-94 (ZIF-94-umIm) presents amphiphilic character and high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption (2.34&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;kPa and 0 &#176;C). The MMM with 5&#160;wt.% loading showed a 70% increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability (8900 Barrer) and 10% higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (20.2) compared to pure PIM-1 membranes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aims to enhance the compatibility between filler and polymer in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), addressing an important challenge in membrane development. ZIF-94, known for its affinity to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was partially modified with 2-undecylimidazolate (umIm) through the solvent-assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method to improve its compatibility with the prototypical polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM-1. The modified ZIF-94 (ZIF-94-umIm) can be considered as an amphiphilic MOF with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, while maintaining a considerably high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity (2.34&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;kPa and 0&#160;&#176;C). Gas separation experiments were performed using mixed gas compositions of 15/85 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 3&#160;bar and 35 &#176;C. The resulting MMM with a 5&#160;wt.% loading exhibited an enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance, with ca. 70% and 10% increases in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability (8900 Barrer) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (20.2), respectively, compared to pristine PIM-1 membranes. In addition, thin film nanocomposite membranes were prepared showing a 23.5 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity at 2350 GPU of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This modification strategy shows a great potential for improving the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture technologies, highlighting the potential of tailoring MOF fillers for advanced membrane materials in gas separation applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Stiffening by Macrocycle Clustering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic hosts can remotely rigidify part of a molecule, implying that this part need not be included inside a macrocycle to be stiffened. Here, we show that multiple binding by synthetic hosts CB[7] and CB[8] can selectively rigidify fragments of a tetratopic molecule in water causing a gradual stiffening from the periphery to the core. This suggests that protein dynamics (and so function) could be tuned by targeted multiple external binding.








Abstract
Allosteric stiffening of a portion of a protein surface is a strategy used in nature to regulate protein oligomerization and provide crucial functions for cells. However, a similar strategy to selectively control part of a compound dynamics remains elusive. Here we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles can bind almost all portions of a tetratopic guest molecule, stiffening the different parts of the guest to different extents. &#8220;Host&#8211;guest&#8221; interactions were found to be instrumental in selectively &#8220;freezing&#8221; guest molecular motions. The combination of 1H&#8208;NMR (1D, 2D), DOSY, VT&#8208;NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), mass spectrometry and molecular modelling enabled to highlight the crucial role of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) binding in the selective hardening of relevant portions of the guest molecule. Beyond implications for bioinspired systems mimicking control of a system dynamic to create a new function, this approach has relevance for improving room temperature phosphorescence, and could also be used to allosterically control organocatalysis in water.

         <title>Highly Efficient Acceptors with a Nonaromatic Thianthrene Central Core for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept central core of nonaromatic thianthrene is explored for the first time, affording an exotic but structurally tailorable molecular platform for NFAs design.








Abstract
Despite the great role in determining molecular packings and organic photovoltaic outcomes, very rare candidates could be employed as central cores in current high&#8208;performance acceptors except diimide&#8208;based moieties. Herein, a new type of central core of nonaromatic thianthrene is explored firstly, affording an exotic but structurally tailorable molecular platform for acceptor design. A unique puckered rather than planar conformation of central core is adopted, caused by the 4n &#960;e&#8722; feature, great ring strain and largely the insufficient p&#8211;&#960; orbital overlap of lone pair on sulfur of thianthrene and coterminous benzene planes. As a result, the absorption of thianthrene&#8208;based acceptors (CS1, CS2, and CS3) shows unexpected blue shift comparing to the phenazine&#8208;based counterpart (CH20), regardless of the intrinsically strong electron&#8208;donating characteristic of low valence sulfur atoms. Even so, the desired molecular packing and fibrillary film morphology, assisted by the suitable chlorination on thianthrene, still contribute to the best device efficiency of 19.0% based on D18:CS2 blends. Such novel work renders an underdeveloped NFA platform with the potentials for achieving PCE of over 20%.

         <title>Unraveling the Surface Chemistry of Aluminum Oxo Archimedean Cages for Efficient Serial Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the atomic wonders of aluminum oxo archimedean cages. This study reveals the captivating surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages at the atomic level. The diverse surface chemistry not only showcases the unique properties of these structures but also facilitates efficient solid&#8208;liquid and solid&#8208;gas serial adsorption.








Abstract
Multifunctional materials that meet diverse application needs hold profound significance in resource optimization, efficiency enhancement, and environmental sustainability. However, the development of these materials faces numerous challenges, including raw material acquisition, design feasibility, and long&#8208;term stability. This study demonstrates the innovative application of the surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages in efficient serial adsorption. The &#8220;Four&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; surface chemistry enables various single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) structural transformations, involving ligand modification, cation exchange, post&#8208;synthetic metalation, and metal elimination, successfully achieving the first reversible SC&#8208;SC transformation from cluster structures to infinite frameworks. The fundamental reason behind these dynamic structural changes lies in the exceptional balance between rigidity and flexibility provided by the intercluster tri&#8208;pyrazole sites on the Archimedean cages. This diverse structural transformation characteristic offers extensive application potential for solid&#8208;liquid and solid&#8208;gas serial adsorption. For instance, this material effectively adsorbs heavy metal ions in water treatment and can subsequently be used for the permanent fixation of gaseous radionuclides. This work not only deepens our understanding of dynamic chemistry but also provides guiding significance for environmental remediation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lugdunomycin via Sequential Photoinduced Spiroketalization and Isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical synthetic strategy inspired by the angucyclinone biosynthesis culminated in the total synthesis of lugdunomycin. The keys in the total synthesis were 1) the design of the photoinduced spiroketalization to constitute elmonin from actinaphthoran B, and 2) photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin and iso&#8208;maleimycin to construct the polycyclic framework.








Abstract
The presence of sterically rigid contiguous quaternary stereocenters in natural products imposes conformational constraints with significant effects on their biological activities. However, achieving the direct synthesis of multiple contiguous quaternary stereocenters in a single step remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present the total synthesis of the antibacterial metabolite lugdunomycin (1) in thirteen steps via a sequence of photochemical transformations. A photoenolization, keto&#8211;enol tautomerization, and spiroketalization sequence was developed to generate the spiroketal 4 from actinaphthoran B (3). Subsequently, a photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin (4) and iso&#8208;maleimycin (5) was developed to construct the polycyclic benzaza[4,3,3]propellane framework bearing three contiguous quaternary stereocenters in the compact C&#8208;ring along with a distal hydroxyl group at C19. The mechanism of these photochemical reactions was investigated using synthetic and computational approaches.

         <title>Stability and Mitochondrial Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Organogold(III) Complex with Diphosphine Ancillary Ligand in Lung Cancer Cells</title>

The combination of cryo&#8208;synchrotron radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF), cryo&#8208;synchrotron radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray absorption (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XAS) and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry demonstrates the high intracellular stability of a biphenyl gold(III) diphosphine complex indicating the native organogold cation as the active species. A combination of in&#8208;cell labeling and cellular gold mapping by cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF indicates the mitochondrial accumulation of the stable cationic gold complex.








Abstract
We present a comprehensive study on the chemical reactivity in the gas phase, with amino acids and peptides, and in the cell, the anticancer activity and localization of a series of seven cationic biphenyl gold(III) complexes with aryl, alkyl, and chiral diphosphine ancillary ligands. Despite some structural differences, all the complexes similarly featured high stability toward reduction or ligand exchange in cell&#8208;free conditions. The biphenyl Au(III) complex including the 1,2&#8208;diphenylphosphinoethane (dppe) ligand manifested the same high stability in a cellular setting, as attested by a combination of cryo&#8208;Synchrotron Radiation&#8208;X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF) nano&#8208;imaging and cryo&#8208;Synchrotron Radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XAS) measurements. Tandem cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF elemental mapping and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the selective accumulation of the dppe complex in mitochondria. This represents the first study of the speciation and distribution of an organogold(III) complex in cancer cells.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer Across Phospholipid Bilayers in Anaerobic and Aerobic Atmospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven transmembrane electron transfer across a biomimetic lipid bilayer membrane in aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres is achieved using an organic transmembrane oriented chromophore. The transmembrane molecule is designed symmetrically and easy to synthesize. This model system enables light&#8208;driven oxidation and reduction in the different compartments of the liposome, mimicking the photosynthesis system.








Abstract
In natural photosynthesis, light&#8208;driven electron transfer across the thylakoid membrane enables efficient charge separation and the confinement of reaction spaces for generating NADPH and CO2 and oxidation of water. These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance. However, current artificial photosynthesis studies only take place in the bulk and are sensitive toward oxygen and air, which limits their applicability under aerated and water&#8208;splitting conditions. Herein, we report light&#8208;driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light&#8208;driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light&#8208;driven reduction of an organic water&#8208;soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes. Additionally, the system is active in both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres, rendering it ideal for aerobic conditions or reactions that produce oxygen such as solar&#8208;driven water splitting and artificial photosynthesis applications.

         <title>Macromolecule&#8208;Enriched Solvation Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vulnerable small molecules in the Na+ solvation shell are replaced by macromolecules with high thermodynamic stability, which suppress oxidative/reductive decomposition, such as gas evolution, enabling 4.4&#160;V&#8208;class sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rechargeability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a viable alternative for sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their energy density is curtailed by relatively low voltage outputs (&lt; 4&#160;V) due to the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we describe a high&#8208;voltage Na+ electrolyte featuring a macromolecule&#8208;enriched solvation architecture. The vulnerable small molecules in the Na+ solvation shell are replaced by macro polyamide (PA) molecules with high thermodynamic resilience, ensuring a wide electrochemical stability window for the electrolytes with suppressed oxidative/reductive decomposition. Concomitantly, the anions engage in H&#8208;bonding with the amido groups of PA, which not only stabilizes the anions against hydrolysis, but also delivers a high Na+ transference number of 0.93. Importantly, the nitrogen&#8208;rich composition of the macromolecule&#8208;enriched electrolyte (MEE) fosters the formation of robust nitride interphases that impart enduring stability to both the cathode and anode. As a result, the hard carbon (HC) || NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) full cells demonstrate significant rechargeability even with an ultrahigh cutoff voltage of 4.4&#160;V. Our approach distinctively avoids the use of fluorinated molecules typically found in (localized&#8208;) high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, presenting a novel principle that could revolutionize high&#8208;voltage electrolyte design.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Peptide Nanotubes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptide&#8211;polymer conjugates, with varied length of hydrophobic alkyl linker group, are synthesized and assembled into nanotubes in water. Both synthetic studies and computational molecular dynamics simulations confirm the degree of hydrophobicity, providing an avenue to tune the length and dynamic nature of the peptide nanotubes.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;conjugated peptides are attractive building blocks for the construction of new nanomaterials. However, the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of these materials remains a major limitation to their wider utilization. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fine&#8208;tune the assembly of water&#8208;soluble hydrophilic polymer&#8208;conjugated cyclic peptides by incorporating a defined, short hydrocarbon linker between the polymer and peptide. This addition creates a well&#8208;defined hydrophobic &#8220;inner shell&#8221; that suppresses water from disrupting the organized peptide hydrogen bond network. Our approach is demonstrated using a series of cyclic peptide&#8208;linker&#8208;PDMA conjugates that were evaluated by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation, small angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations were also used to show how the polymer and the peptide stacks interact and illustrate the impact of this hydrophobic inner shell approach. This strategy provides a modular approach to fine control the nanotube self&#8208;assembling behavior. We expect that this technique will improve the versatility of peptide nanotubes for the engineering of advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Constructing Stable and Wavelength&#8208;Extended Heptamethine Cyanines via Donor Ectopic Substitution for NIR&#8208;IIa/b Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR&#8208;II cyanine. These novel dyes (NIR&#8208;ACs) exhibited an excellent stability, great emission redshift, and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb). Using these dyes, we have successfully achieved high&#8208;contrast tumor and bone&#8208;targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging.








Abstract
Organic NIR&#8208;II dyes, particularly cyanine fluorophores, offer high molar extinction coefficients, biocompatibility, and structural tunability and are popular for noninvasive, high&#8208;resolution, and &#8208;contrast in vivo imaging. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;wavelength, and large Stokes shift NIR&#8208;II cyanine suitable for NIR&#8208;IIa/IIb bioimaging is still a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength by the enhanced Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;Lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) separation through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR&#8208;II cyanine. Compared to the original NIR&#8208;II cyanine Flav7, these novel dyes (NIR&#8208;ACs) exhibited a significant emission redshift and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb). Notably, they also demonstrate excellent stability and deeper tissue imaging ability in vivo imaging.

     alt="Constructing Stable and Wavelength-Extended Heptamethine Cyanines via Donor Ectopic Substitution for NIR-IIa/b Bioimaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reported a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR-II cyanine. These novel dyes (NIR-ACs) exhibited an excellent stability, great emission redshift, and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300&#160;nm (NIR-IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500&#160;nm (NIR-IIb). Using these dyes, we have successfully achieved high-contrast tumor and bone-targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic NIR-II dyes, particularly cyanine fluorophores, offer high molar extinction coefficients, biocompatibility, and structural tunability and are popular for noninvasive, high-resolution, and -contrast in vivo imaging. However, achieving stable, long-wavelength, and large Stokes shift NIR-II cyanine suitable for NIR-IIa/IIb bioimaging is still a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength by the enhanced Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;Lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) separation through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR-II cyanine. Compared to the original NIR-II cyanine Flav7, these novel dyes (NIR-ACs) exhibited a significant emission redshift and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300&#160;nm (NIR-IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500&#160;nm (NIR-IIb). Notably, they also demonstrate excellent stability and deeper tissue imaging ability in vivo imaging. Finally, through surface modification of nanoparticles, NIR-ACs nanoparticles (NPs) have successfully achieved high-contrast tumor and bone-targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging, providing robust tools for in vivo diagnostics and biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approach Toward Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Arylation by Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Arylboration of Electron Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of carbonyl compounds is presented. The Cu&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction involves 1,2&#8208;arylboration of electron deficient alkenes and proceeds with high levels of selectivity. The mechanism is addressed and suggests that a boron ligated enolate is responsible for high selectivity. 








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling of enolates&#8212;&#945;&#8208;arylation&#8212;is an established method for chemical synthesis. A major challenge in the field is control of stereochemistry for the &#945;&#8208;carbon. This is typically due to facile epimerization under the basic reaction conditions for &#945;&#8208;arylation. In this study, an alternative approach is presented that involves the Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylboration of electron deficient alkenes. The products are generated with high levels of diastereoselectivity for a broad range of substitution patterns. Enantioselective variants are also presented in addition to product derivatizations.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Fortimicin B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of fortimicin B was realized in 12 steps (LLS) from readily available starting materials. The fortamine fragment was synthesized in a concise manner based on a newly developed enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The 6&#8208;epi&#8208;purpurosamine B fragment was constructed via a Cr(II)/Co(I)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C bond coupling. These two fragments were connected through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. This study provides a synthetic platform for future investigations into the structure&#8211;activity relationships of fortimicins.








Abstract
Fortimicins, featuring a pseudodisaccharide scaffold, are an unusual class of aminoglycosides (AGs) with potent efficacy against several aminoglycoside&#8208;resistant bacterial strains. Notably, these molecules also exhibit lower inherent ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity than common aminoglycosides. Consequently, fortimicins are a promising type of protoypical molecules for the development of the next generation of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of fortimicin B in 12 steps (longest linear sequence, LLS) from readily available starting materials. An enantioselective Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;oxazolones was developed for the efficient synthesis of the fortamine fragment, which previously required a lengthy multistep synthesis owing to its complex stereochemistry. The 6&#8208;epi&#8208;purpurosamine B fragment was efficiently synthesized through a Cr(II)/Co(I)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C bond coupling between aldehydes and alkyl halides. Within these two fragments, the stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond of fortimicin B was realized via the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation. Overall, this study provides an efficient synthetic platform for future investigations into the structure&#8211;activity relationships of fortimicins.

         <title>Highly Stable Sn&#9472;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Phenol&#8208;Functionalized Hole Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stability is the key challenge for Sn&#9472;Pb perovskites. This work tackles the critical stability issue by introducing phenol hydroxylation in the hole transporting material (HTM). The phenol group enhances oxidation resistance and regulates crystallization kinetics, while fluorine improves energy alignment. This strategy boosts device stability by 40 times and achieves a 23.61% power conversion efficiency (PCE), offering a universal approach for advancing Sn&#9472;based perovskites.








Abstract
Sn&#9472;Pb perovskites, a most promising low bandgap semiconductor for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, are often limited by instability due to the susceptibility of Sn2+ to oxidation. Inspired by the antioxidative properties of polyphenolic compounds, we introduce the reductive phenol group and strong electronegative fluorine into an organic conjugated structure and design a multi&#8208;functional polymer with fluorine and phenol units (PF&#9472;OH). The design of PF&#9472;OH allows the effective rise in the energy barrier of Sn2+ oxidation, leading to a significant enhancement in the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite devices from 200 to 8000 h&#8212;an improvement of around 100 times. Additionally, the strong binding energy between Sn2+ and the phenol in PF&#9472;OH critically influences Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite's crystallization and grain growth, resulting in perovskite films with fewer pinholes at the buried interface and extended carrier lifetimes. This enhancement not only boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 23.61%, but also significantly improves the operational stability of the devices. Ultimately, this design strategy has been proven universal through the phenolization of a series of molecules, marking a milestone in enhancing the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb perovskites.

The use of carbon dioxide and alkenes as feedstocks for the production of carboxylic acids holds great significance in sustainable chemistry. Herein, we introduce a simple and unifying nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical hydrocarboxylation for both functionalized and unactivated alkenes at proximal and remote sites.

Abstract
The utilization of carbon dioxide and alkenes as feedstocks for the synthesis of carboxylic acids holds great significance in the realm of sustainable chemistry. Nonetheless, achieving selective C&#9472;H bond carboxylation of alkenes with broad applicability has long been a challenging task. Herein, we present a straightforward and unifying approach for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylic acids through nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical hydrocarboxylation of both functionalized and unactivated, simple alkenes, at proximal and remote sites. Notably, this operationally simple catalytic reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, having excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigations showed that a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (Ni&#8208;HAT) pathway is in operation, accounting for the site&#8208;selective hydrocarboxylation protocol for various alkene substrates.

         <title>Revealing Collaborative Effects of Binary Additives on Regulating Precursor Crystallization Toward Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

The introduction of both PMAI and 2PACz into the precursor effectively cleaves edge&#8208;shared Pb&#8208;I octahedra to facilitate the transformation from PbI2 to PbI3&#8722; complexes as prenucleation clusters, and thus produces much larger colloidal particles with accelerated nucleation. Simultaneously, the crystallization in both spin&#8208;coating and annealing processes is significantly postponed owing to the stronger interaction between perovskite and binary additives with more functional groups. Benefiting from such rapid nucleation and slow crystallization, high&#8208;quality perovskite layer with larger&#8208;sized crystals and fewer defects is formed, and the corresponding device could achieve a high efficiency of 26.05% (certified 25.49%).








Abstract
Fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite layers is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. Considering the significant advancements made in additive engineering for optimizing perovskite crystallization using single additive, exploring the collaborative effect of dual additives on precursor for perovskite crystallization may be an effective way for further advancing device performance. Herein, a binary additives strategy is proposed, where phenylmethylammonium iodide (PMAI) and [2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) are introduced into the precursor. Compared with the precursor with no additives or a single additive (PMAI or 2PACz), the use of dual additives more effectively cleaves edge&#8208;shared Pb&#8208;I octahedra to expedite the transformation from PbI2 to PbI3&#8722; complexes as prenucleation clusters and produces much larger colloidal particles with accelerated nucleation. Concurrently, the crystallization in both spin&#8208;coating and annealing processes is significantly retarded due to the stronger interaction between perovskite and binary additives. Benefiting from such rapid nucleation and slow crystallization, high&#8208;quality perovskite layer with larger&#8208;sized crystals and fewer defects is formed, resulting in mitigated microstrain, enhanced charge extraction, and suppressed nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the device derived from the use of dual additives could achieve an impressive efficiency of 26.05% (certified 25.49%) and retained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1200 h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dendritic Oligo&#8208;Glycerol Cationic Surfactants for Enhanced Antibacterial Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal click chemistry approach was used to synthesize a series of cationic surfactants. The results show that an optimal balance between positive charges and hydrophobicity is a crucial factor for the improvement of antibacterial properties. Within our synthesized library, surfactants with a C12 alkyl chain and four positive charges showed remarkable bactericidal activity and antibiofilm effects against drug&#8208;resistant MRSA. In addition, these surfactants significantly promoted wound healing in MRSA&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance present an ever&#8208;increasing threat to human health worldwide, and medicine urgently needs new alternatives for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. Cationic surfactants have proven to be effective antibacterial agents due to their ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, inhibit biofilm formation, and combat a broad spectrum of pathogens. We employed a orthogonal click chemistry strategy for the efficient modular synthesis of six novel cationic surfactants. Our results emphasize the strong correlation between the surfactant design and its antibacterial potential. Among these six cationic surfactants we identified a prime candidate, which possessed an impressive antibacterial effect against gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria, including drug&#8208;resistant strains. We found that our surfactant can prevent biofilm formation and eradicate already existing biofilms. Cryo&#8208;TEM imaging was used to reveal the membrane&#8208;disrupting properties of the surfactant. In&#8208;vivo wound healing experiments underline the surfactants&#8217; ability to inhibit wound infections. Cationic surfactants often face the challenge of balancing strong antibacterial activity with minimal cytotoxicity. Our strategic design and orthogonal click chemistry approach have enabled precise fine&#8208;tuning of molecular structures to achieve an optimal balance between antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility, effectively overcoming this critical limitation.

         <title>Spatially Coupling Electronic&#8211;Ionic Transport in Organic Mixed Conductors as Cathodes for Efficient Zn&#8211;V Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated mixed electronic&#8211;ionic conductor is developed by spatially coupling transport pathways, enabling redistribution and fast transport of charges. Dual&#8208;conductive pathways assembled at the nanoscale could enhance energy storage by more active sites and fast kinetics. Reversible ionic channels from the self&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping process defend active material against proton corrosion, contributing to excellent areal capacity and cyclability. 








Abstract
In conventional electrodes, concentration polarization by unbalanced charge transport and solid&#8208;state diffusion resistance result in sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we propose an integrated mixed electronic&#8211;ionic conductor by spatially coupling charge transport pathways, which could achieve redistribution and fast transport of charge (Zn2+/e&#8722;). Operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the charge transport mechanisms and intrinsic conducting characteristics at timescale. Through confinement by vanadium oxide, dual&#8208;conductive pathways were self&#8208;assembled at the nanoscale and provided effective charge storage. This provided high charge density and accelerated ionic diffusion in the bulk phase, resulting in more active sites and faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, reversible ionic channels from the self&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping process reduced the dissolution of active materials by protons and enabled conversion chemistry, improving cycling stability at low current density. Consequently, the modulated cathode (PEDOT&#8208;SO3&#8208;ZnVO) delivered a high&#8208;rate performance of 310/148&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (0.2/10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) at 10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the conventional electrode at 21&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 achieved an ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 6.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and superior cycling stability (79.1% retention over 100 cycles at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). This work opens the way for the precise modulation of the electrochemical performance of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expansion of Furyl Hydrosilanes: Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Oxasilines as Diels&#8208;Alder Diene Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Ru&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion of readily available silylfurans has been achieved, allowing access to 1,2&#8208;oxasilines in excellent yields. Featuring cyclic dienes with a Si&#9472;O linker, 1,2&#8208;oxasilines display high reactivity in DA cycloaddition with a broad range of electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles. The Si&#9472;O linker could be reserved, transformed or extruded in the DA cycloadducts, enabling flexible assembly of diverse molecular skeletons with high complexity.








Abstract
The development of new methods for aromatic ring&#8208;expansion offers a strategic means of transforming abundant aromatic feedstocks into intricate structures via skeletal editing, thereby unlocking valuable avenues for organic synthesis. We report herein a mild and efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;expansion of 2&#8208;silylfurans to form 1,2&#8208;oxasilines with wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the reaction proceeds through regioselective insertion of furan double bond into a Ru&#9472;H bond, followed by skeletal rearrangement, 1,2&#8208;hydride transfer, and elimination steps. The resulting 1,2&#8208;oxasilines are electron&#8208;rich cyclic dienes with an extrudable and transformable Si&#9472;O linker, which exhibit unique and versatile reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder cyclization with electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles, enabling modular assembly of molecular skeletons with higher complexity.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Depolymerization of Polymethacrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the thermal depolymerization of various polymethacrylamides, proving monomer regeneration of this class for the first time. Enhanced by the addition of a free radical initiator, the depolymerization proceeds at temperatures as low as 90&#160;&#176;C to high conversion, and we also demonstrated the applicability to the depolymerization of a methacrylamide hydrogel.








Abstract
The depolymerization of polymers synthesized by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential for recovering monomers at low temperatures. However, current reports focus solely on polymethacrylates, significantly limiting applications, scope, and fundamental understanding. Although polymethacrylamides are highly valued for their excellent biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and water solubility, their chemical recycling remains experimentally unattainable, irrespective of their synthesis method (i.e., free radical, RDRP, anionic, etc.). Herein, we present the first example of thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) depolymerization of various polymethacrylamides, regenerating monomers at high yields. Central to our work was the identification of two key weaknesses associated with polymethacrylamides, namely, i) insufficient end&#8208;group activation, and ii) premature end&#8208;group loss at higher temperatures, leading to compromised monomer yields and low depolymerization rates. These challenges were bypassed via the addition of commercially available radical initiators, resulting in faster reactions and higher percentages of recovered monomer at as low as 90&#160;&#176;C. The broad applicability of this method was further demonstrated by its compatibility with various RAFT agents, and the possibility to depolymerize a crosslinked hydrogel. Our work expands the depolymerization scope of high&#8208;value materials beyond polymethacrylates and shines a light on intriguing thermodynamic and kinetic insights.

         <title>Programmable Mono&#8208;/Di&#8208;alkylation of Amines with Aldehydes Over a Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H Electrocatalyst</title>

We present a programmable electrocatalytic method for mono&#8208;/di&#8208;alkylation N&#8208;alkylation of amines over a Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H electrocatalyst, enabling the precise synthesis of alkylamines with two controllable alkyl groups and one methyl group while achieving satisfactory FE values (86%&#8211;96%).








Abstract
Programmable amine N&#8208;alkylation provides a new method to combine the required alkyl groups with amine molecules according to actual demand and to precisely regulate the biological and pharmaceutical properties of life science amine molecules. However, only the electrochemical mono&#8208;methylation of amines has been achieved via C&#9472;N coupling with CO2 accompanied by an unsatisfactory Faraday efficiency (FE) lower than 10%. Herein, we developed programmable electrocatalytic N&#8208;alkylation of amines with two controllable alkyl groups and one methyl group. Both experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated the critical role of electron&#8208;enriched Pd metals in transforming amines into alkylamines with two chosen alkyl groups and a methyl group. Moreover, the electrocatalytic transformation of amines to alkylamines with satisfactory FE values (86%&#8211;96%) has been achieved, further expanding the scope of electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling and possibly opening a new world of electrochemical amine N&#8208;alkylation.

         <title>Nuclear&#8208;Targeted Material Enabled Intranuclear MicroRNA Imaging for Tracking Gene Editing Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient nuclear&#8208;targeted material, phenylboronic acid modified linear PEI (LPBA), is reported to load gene editing plasmids and fluorescent probes for tracking microRNA&#8208;21 (miR&#8208;21) gene editing in cancer cells. Based on LPBA, intranuclear miR&#8208;21 precursors (pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21) imaging is achieved, resulting in real&#8208;time detection of the gene editing process in single living cells and in vivo. 








Abstract
Gene editing technology based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) systems serves as an efficient tool in cancer therapy. Tracking the gene editing process can help identify the progress of cancer treatment. However, existing techniques for monitoring the gene editing process rely on lysed cells, which can not reflect the dynamic changes of nucleic acid in living cells. It urgently needs in situ and real&#8208;time imaging technologies to track the gene editing process at a living single&#8208;cell level more effectively and precisely. Here, we reported a highly efficient nuclear&#8208;targeted material, phenylboronic acid modified linear PEI (LPBA), for loading gene editing plasmids and fluorescent probes to track gene editing processes of microRNA. Based on LPBA, we achieved efficient intranuclear microRNA imaging at the living cell level, reaching 32.4&#8208;fold higher than the linear PEI (LPEI) delivery system, which facilitated further sensitive monitoring of the gene editing process both in living cells and in vivo. Meanwhile, this efficient gene&#8208;editing and real&#8208;time detection technique could be extended to screening effective gene&#8208;editing plasmids. Such LPBA&#8208;based imaging technology extended the imaging area of microRNA and offered new insight in the field of gene editing and nucleic acid detection.

         <title>Illuminating Lead Coordination in Perovskite Precursors via Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

Fluorescence spectroscopy captures the subtle yet critical changes in multi&#8208;scale lead coordination environments in perovskite precursor. By systematically probing halide&#8208;based [PbX6]&#8308;&#8315; octahedra under varied solvents and cations, this work reveals &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; charting the evolution from low&#8208;dimensional clusters to 3D frameworks.








Abstract
The properties of perovskite precursors critically determine the ultimate performance of perovskite devices, yet simple and accessible real&#8208;time precursor characterization methods remain scarce. Here, we systematically investigate the lead (Pb) coordination environment in perovskite precursors using fluorescence spectroscopy. By examining lead halide [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedra (X&#9552;Cl, Br, I) and monitoring their luminescence under different solvents and A&#8208;site cation compositions, we unveil how [PbX6]4&#8722; distinct aggregation states give rise to characteristic fluorescence &#8220;fingerprints.&#8221; We find that halide choice, solvent coordination, and A&#8208;site cations collectively exert pronounced effects on the photoluminescence (PL) peak positions, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Moreover, we demonstrate that fluorescence spectroscopy can capture subtle changes in intermediate perovskite structures&#8212;including low&#8208;dimensional nanoscale clusters and the formation of higher&#8208;dimensional networks. This robust optical method offers a powerful and straightforward approach for tracing the nucleation stage, evaluating solvent&#8211;solute and solute&#8211;solute interactions, and differentiating Pb coordination states in real time. The aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of inorganic systems and the structure&#8208;activity relationship at the aggregate level have important guiding significance for the design of materials.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework as a Li&#8208;Ion Guided Channel Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Anode in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N&#8208;rich urea&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;531) has been developed as an interfacial ion&#8208;transport guided channel for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The framework facilitates uniform Li+ flux through its porous architecture and N&#8208;rich coordination sites, effectively suppressing dendritic growth. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates enhanced Li deposition homogeneity and cycling stability, highlighting COF&#8208;531's potential in developing safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal exhibits great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical application of Li metal anodes is severely hindered by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites as well as the instability of the spontaneously generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), causing safety concerns and lifespan issues. Herein, we customize a novel urea&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;531) as an interfacial Li&#8208;ion guided channel.

&lt;p&gt;A novel N-rich urea-linked covalent organic framework (COF-531) has been developed as an interfacial ion-transport guided channel for lithium-metal anodes. The framework facilitates uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux through its porous architecture and N-rich coordination sites, effectively suppressing dendritic growth. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates enhanced Li deposition homogeneity and cycling stability, highlighting COF-531's potential in developing safe, high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal exhibits great potential for achieving high-energy-density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical application of Li metal anodes is severely hindered by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites as well as the instability of the spontaneously generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), causing safety concerns and lifespan issues. Herein, we customize a novel urea-linked covalent organic framework (COF-531) as an interfacial Li-ion guided channel. The COF-531 is constructed utilizing a highly dynamic urea-linkage, which balances the low reactivity of N-rich melamine (MA), and could simultaneously provide abundant lithiophilic N sites and crystallinity ordered ion channels. This structure is able to promote efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation and transport, leading to uniform deposition via inhibiting dendrites growth. As a result, the COF@Li anode exhibits remarkable cycling performance under high current density (10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 11500&#160;h and 20&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 6000&#160;h in the symmetric Li cells, and 1013&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500 cycles under 8.4&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a COF@Li || S-in-CMK-3 cell), setting a new benchmark for long-cycle performance in carbonate-based electrolyte. Remarkably, the COF-531 can be produced at a low-cost (&#8764;58.6&#160;USD kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) on a kilogram scale. This work addresses a critical bottleneck in the commercialization of Li-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Three c&#8208;MOFs with twisted significant &#960;&#8208;system conformation were designed and synthesized, the crystallinity, conductivity, and pore environment of which can be tuned by halogen substitution. The F&#8208;substituted FHBCOH&#8208;Cu demonstrates superior crystallinity and conductive properties exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking specific capacitance of 943&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibiting graphite&#8208;like van der Waals stacked layers have been recognized as a new type of crystalline conductive materials and have shown rapid progress in the last decade. However, the purposive design and modulation of their conductive properties and related application performance remains a challenge. Herein, we present a new type of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with contorted conformation and substituent&#8208;modulated structures for highperformance of the capacitor. Octahydroxy&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBCOH) with a contorted graphene nanosheet core is designed and synthesized as the ligand. The F&#8208;substituted 2D c&#8208;MOF FHBCOH&#8208;Cu demonstrates superior crystallinity and conductive properties exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking specific capacitance of 943&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The improved crystallinity, enhanced conductivity, and pore environment control enabled by halogen substitution, combined with the contorted conformation synergistically accomplish high performance of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as electrode materials in supercapacitors. This study introduces a novel molecular design strategy for the construction of 2D c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based high&#8208;performance energy storage materials.

         <title>Low Strain Mediated Zn (0002) Plane Epitaxial Plating for Highly Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated anthracene triptycene photopolymerized on Zn plate exhibits nanocrystalline structure with highly ordered nanochannels (1.5 nm), which divides low&#8208;strain nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and enables sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane with low nucleation energy (0.2&#160;e&#8722;&#160;&#197;&#8722;3), low&#8208;grain strain (&#8722;0.2 to 0.4 MPa), and low&#8208;strain accumulation (3.7 MPa), enabling highly reversible and stable Zn anodes for advanced zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Optimizing the crystalline orientation to achieve stable Zn (0002) plane growth is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, the lattice strain of Zn substrate hinders stable Zn2+ plating/stripping and sustainable epitaxial growth of Zn (0002) texture. Herein, we present a low&#8208;strain strategy to mediate nucleated&#8208;Zn grains for stabilizing Zn2+ electrodeposition/stripping process and guiding sustainable Zn2+ growth along (0002) surfaces. Fluorinated anthracene triptycene polymer (FATP) photopolymerized on Zn exhibits nanocrystalline structure with highly ordered nanochannels (1.5&#160;nm), enabling oriented nucleation and sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane due to low nucleation energy (0.2 vs. 1.1&#160;e&#8722;&#160;&#197;&#8722;3 of pure Zn) and low grain strain (&#8722;0.2 to 0.4 vs. &#8722;0.9 to 0.9&#160;MPa). Besides, the ordered porous FATP nanofilm refines electroplating Zn grains (9.4 vs. 26.7&#160;&#181;m), alleviating strain accumulation (3.7 vs. 28.2&#160;MPa) and lattice distortion. Consequently, FATP&#8208;Zn||Cu cell achieves a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% over 6000 cycles, while FATP&#8208;Zn||FATP&#8208;Zn cell shows stable plating/stripping after 5000 h. Notably, FATP&#8208;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell (2.77 Ah) demonstrates stable operation over 1000 cycles. This work presents a new approach to designing Zn anodes with refined nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and sustainable Zn (0002) plane stacking for advanced ZMBs.

A dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework is constructed via precipitation polymerization, achieving the spatially controlled codelivery of molecular beacon and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine.








Abstract
Theranostic platforms that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities offer promising strategies for precision medicine, particularly in the treatment of major diseases. However, the development of platforms capable of achieving spatially controlled detection and therapy at the lesion site remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework that achieve spatially controlled codelivery of molecular beacon (MB) and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy for pancreatic cancer. The DNA nanoframeworks are synthesized via precipitation polymerization, utilizing acrylamide&#8208;modified DNA to initiate a hybridization chain reaction that facilitates the effective loading of MB&#8208;extended and sgRNA&#8208;conjugated DNA hairpins. The Cas9 protein is efficiently loaded into the nanoframeworks through phase transition&#8208;induced polymer chain rearrangement, overcoming steric hindrance. Upon aptamer&#8208;mediated internalization into PANC&#8208;1 cells, the overexpressed apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 and ribonuclease H in cancer cells induce site&#8208;specific cleave of MB and DNA&#8211;RNA hybrid duplex, respectively. This cleavage restores fluorescence for specific optical detection, whereas the released Cas9 RNP performs gene editing for efficient therapy. Low fluorescence background and favorable biocompatibility are observed in normal cells. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine in cancer therapy.

We demonstrated that the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates with alkynes and the radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with nitriles proceeds smoothly via a cobaloxime&#8208;based metalloradical catalysis (MRC) pathway, affording the desired products in high to excellent yields. Key results include broad substrate compatibility, high functional group tolerance, scalability to gram&#8208;scale transformations, and practical applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. The work not only underscores the synthetic utility of cobaloxime complexes but also expands the scope of MRC, providing a robust platform for sustainable and innovative radical transformations in organic synthesis.








Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. Here, an efficient catalytic method has been devised for the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] oxazolation of nitriles using &#945;&#8208;aryldiazoacetates via MRC. Cobaloxime proves effective in facilitating the metalloradical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] oxazolation cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions. The reactions demonstrate broad substrate tolerance, accommodating gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our findings highlight the significant potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition as a valuable tool in organic synthesis and broaden the scope of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

         <title>Fluorophores Nucleate and Stabilize Collagen Triple Helices &#8211; En Route to Better Diagnostic Tools for Fibrosis and Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>

Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are emerging as valuable diagnostic tools for fibrosis and tissue repair. We show that fluorophores markedly impact the folding behavior of CMPs and enhance the stability of the resulting collagen triple helices. Our results highlight that careful selection of the fluorophore is essential when designing CMPs for applications in biology and medicine.








Abstract
Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are useful tools for monitoring fibrotic processes and tissue repair. Fine&#8208;tuning the propensity of the CMP to form a collagen triple helix is crucial since only single&#8208;stranded but not triple&#8208;helical CMPs integrate efficiently into damaged or remodeling tissue. Yet the impact of fluorophores on the folding behavior of CMPs and triple helix stability has so far been underappreciated. Here, we show that N&#8208;terminal fluorophores enhance triple helix stability and nucleation. Thermal denaturation and temperature jump experiments showed that triple helix stability and nucleation are proportionally affected by the accessible surface area of the fluorophore. For biological applications, fluorophores with a small surface area are therefore beneficial. Furthermore, we show that fluorophores bearing ionizable groups with an appropriate pKa value, such as commonly used fluorescein, can be used to create pH&#8208;responsive assemblies. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate fluorophores and spacers when developing fluorescent probes for biological applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Triangular Cu3 Motif Steers CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading Cu multi&#8208;atom catalyst with low&#8208;coordination triangular Cu3 motifs (Cu3 MAC) on polymeric carbon nitride mesoporous nanofibers is developed, which accelerates asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling with unique adsorption configuration of bridge&#8208;adsorbed *CO at paired Cu sites and atop&#8208;adsorbed *CO at adjacent single Cu atom, thus enabling preferential formation of *CHCHOH intermediates to produce ethanol.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 using copper&#8208;based multi&#8208;atom catalysts (MACs) offers a potential approach to achieve value&#8208;added C2+ products. However, achieving MACs with high metal contents and suppressing the thermodynamically favored competing ethylene production pathway remain challenging, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance in ethanol production. Herein, we developed a &#8220;pre&#8208;locking and nanoconfined polymerization&#8221; strategy for synthesis of an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density Cu MAC with low&#8208;coordination triangular Cu3 motifs (Cu3 MAC) on polymeric carbon nitride mesoporous nanofibers. The Cu3 MAC with Cu contents of 36&#8201;wt% achieves a high reactivity of 117 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for ethanol production from CO2 and H2O, with a remarkable selectivity of 98% under simulated sunlight irradiation, representing one of the highest performances in ambient conditions without sacrificial reagents. The superior catalytic efficiency is attributed to the triangular Cu3 configuration, in which both Cu(I) and Cu(II) coexist, predominantly as Cu(I). Such Cu3 motifs act as strong alkaline sites that effectively chemisorb and activate CO2, extend visible&#8208;light absorption range, while accumulating high&#8208;density electrons and favoring 12&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer products. An accelerated asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling with adsorption configuration of the bridge&#8208;adsorbed *CO at paired Cu sites and atop&#8208;adsorbed *CO at adjacent single Cu atom was observed, enabling preferential formation of *CHCHOH intermediates to produce ethanol.

         <title>Constructing Mechanical&#8211;Chemical Stability via Multiphase Riveting and Interface Optimization Toward Layer&#8208;structured Oxide Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing rapid quenching techniques to construct a multiphase structure with dislocations and F&#8722; doping we revealed the advantages of dislocations and defects in enhancing the material's mechanical and kinetic performance. Meanwhile the strong TM&#9472;F covalent network synergistically stabilizes transition metal dissolution and lattice oxygen loss. The layered cathode obtained through this straightforward triple&#8208;benefit strategy demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in the 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V voltage range.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based layer&#8208;structured oxide materials are considered as one of the most competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and efficient sodium intercalation chemistry. Their electrochemical performance, however, is hindered by mechanical and chemical failures stemming from weak interlayer interactions, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect of Mn3+ and unstable surfaces. To address these issues, a quenching method was employed to fabricate a robust multiphase structure with a fluorine and dislocation&#8208;rich surface. Through the accumulation of dislocations and the interlocking of multiphase structures, the mechanical stability of the material during (de)sodiation processes is enhanced, while the surface fluorine anchoring further strengthens the chemical stability. Even after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 1&#160;C within the voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V, the designed composite material P2/P3/O3&#8208;Na0.89Ni0.3Mn0.55Cu0.1Ti0.05O1.94F0.06 exhibits impressive capacity retention rates of 87.17% and 90.4%, respectively. This work exemplifies the important role of simultaneous design of mechano&#8208;chemically coupled materials for the development of high performances cathode materials.

         <title>Cation&#8208;in&#8208;Mesopore Complex for 20 Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Battery</title>

The suppression of solvent water activity, along with the regulation of Zn2&#8314; solvation structures and interfacial side reactions, represents the primary objectives in electrolyte design, which prejudices the cycle life of an aqueous battery. In this work, we introduce a novel cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore complex, where Zn2+ cations are confined within a single mesoporous SiO2 cavity, disrupting the contact ion pair solvation structure of Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding between solvated water molecules. The Zn2+&#8211;smSiO2 complexes facilitate the formation of mesopore weak H&#8208;bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H2O.








Abstract
Metallic Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) have arisen as one of the most promising safe energy storage solutions, yet practical development, especially for the Ah&#8208;level ZABs, is severely plagued by unmanageable side reactions and notorious dendrite proliferation. Here, we propose a cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore (CiM) complex chemistry by confining Zn2+ within single&#8208;mesopore cavities to construct a novel paradigm of 20 Ah&#8208;level ZABs. Molecule dynamic and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal that the single&#8208;mesopore SiO2 (smSiO2) traps Zn2+, replacing H2O molecules in the primary sheath and forming Zn2+&#8211;smSiO2 complexes. In situ electrochemical digital holography, in situ interface Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and H&#8208;bonds density analyses clearly confirm that Zn2+&#8211;smSiO2 complexes migrate and adhere onto the metallic Zn, facilitating the formation of mesopore weak H&#8208;bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H2O. Consequently, the Zn anode operates over 800&#160;h under 55% depth of discharge, effectively suppressing H2O degradation and dendrite growth. The Zn//VO2 pouch battery demonstrates capacities of 20.5 Ah at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and 8.59 Ah at 1 A g&#8722;1, and energy density of 65&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 96&#160;Wh L&#8722;1. The proposed cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore complex chemistry may mark a substantial step forward towards more sustainable and reliable ZABs.

&lt;p&gt;The suppression of solvent water activity, along with the regulation of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; solvation structures and interfacial side reactions, represents the primary objectives in electrolyte design, which prejudices the cycle life of an aqueous battery. In this work, we introduce a novel cation-in-mesopore complex, where Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations are confined within a single mesoporous SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cavity, disrupting the contact ion pair solvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrogen bonding between solvated water molecules. The Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;smSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes facilitate the formation of mesopore weak H-bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

         <title>Ethylene Pretreatment Enhances Ethylene Adsorption and Separation over Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C2H4 pretreatment strategy enhances the performance of one&#8208;pot synthesized Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite, enabling exceptional C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, high C2H4 uptake, and superior dynamic separation factor. This enhanced performance originates from the partial reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), which strengthens the adsorbent&#8211;C2H4 interaction. The proposed strategy offers new insights into designing Cu(I)&#8208;based adsorbents and advancing efficient separation processes for practical applications.








Abstract
Efficient ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) separation using low&#8208;energy technologies is crucial for the chemical industry yet remains challenging due to the lack of industrially applicable adsorbents. Cu(I)&#8208;based adsorbents show significant potential; however, traditional synthesis methods often involve complex procedures or reduction steps. Herein, we report that Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite, synthesized for the first time via a one&#8208;pot method with cyclam as the Cu(II) ligand, exhibits a remarkable C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 22.6, a C2H4 uptake of 3.08&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1, and a separation factor of 9.4 under ambient conditions by using a C2H4 pretreatment, placing it among the best&#8208;performing zeolitic materials. The C2H4 pretreatment enhances separation efficiency by partially reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and water resistance through the formation of carbon species during pretreatment. Structural analysis using Rietveld refinement reveals that Cu2+ ions occupy the corners of elliptical single 8&#8208;rings (s8r). X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analysis confirms a reduction in the Cu oxidation state, while X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy corroborates the partial conversion of Cu(II) to Cu(I). Periodic density functional theory calculations further reveal that Cu(I) interacts more strongly with C2H4 than Cu(II). With its straightforward synthesis and enhanced performance through C2H4 pretreatment, Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite presents a promising solution for industrial&#8208;scale C2H4/C2H6 separation.

         <title>Direct Observation of Cyclo&#8208;Pentazolate Anion Decomposition in a Tailored Molecular Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly unstable cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion was trapped within the cavity of a designed molecular cage, without relying on strong interactions, which enabled direct observation of its decomposition using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
The cyclo&#8208;pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) has garnered significant attention as an all&#8208;nitrogen, five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring ion with a high energy state and unique aromaticity. Typically, the free cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion is a highly unstable species, and its stabilization relies on strong interactions, such as a hydrogen bonding network or metal coordination. However, these interactions often compromise the independence of the anion, thus diminishing its aromaticity. Herein, we present a molecular trap designed to encapsulate and isolate cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; through collective weak interactions. This approach utilizes a pre&#8208;positioned ion to subsequently displace the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion into the cage cavity, addressing the challenge posed by the absence of strong&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven binding. This setup preserves the aromaticity of the anion to a significant extent, as predicted by computational studies. More importantly, the decomposition of free cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; within the microenvironment was directly recorded for the first time using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Propylene&#8208;Bridged Associative Bis(bipyridinium) Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Lifetime Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present two propylene&#8208;bridged bis(bipyridinium) compounds, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, as anolytes for aqueous organic redox flow batteries. These compounds undergo intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in Gibbs free energy change of less than &#8722;100&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, which mitigates degradation by forming Gibbs free energy wells. TMAP&#8208;bisV exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8722;1 and demonstrates negligible capacity fade in a 1.5&#160;M e&#8722; cell. 








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) represent a potent technology in low&#8208;cost storage and grid&#8208;scale adoption of renewable electricity, whereas bipyridinium derivatives, the most extensively adopted anolyte, undergo diverse side reactions causing severe loss of battery lifetime. Here, we propose a strategy to promote the formation of intramolecular radical &#960; dimers of reduced bipyridinium electrolytes and stabilize the radical intermediates during charge and discharge, resulting in significant improvements in battery lifetime. Density functional theory calculations reveal that proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrolytes, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, demonstrate Gibbs free energy change of &#8722;101.49&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and &#8722;103.90&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the formation of radical &#960; dimers, as opposed to the less favored &#8722;14.36&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for methyl viologen. Electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8211;vis spectra studies confirmed the significantly facilitated intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV radicals. This translates to a more than one order of magnitude improvement in electrolyte stability for M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV in flow cells. Specifically, TMAP&#8208;bisV possesses a theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8722;1 and exhibits negligible capacity fade at 1.5&#160;M e&#8722;, which represents a new record in this area. We believe the concept may open a promising avenue toward the design of capacity&#8208;dense and super&#8208;stable AORFB electrolytes.

This translates to a more than one order of magnitude improvement in electrolyte stability for M-bisV and TMAP-bisV in flow cells. Specifically, TMAP-bisV possesses a theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits negligible capacity fade at 1.5&#160;M e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which represents a new record in this area. We believe the concept may open a promising avenue toward the design of capacity-dense and super-stable AORFB electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Effects in Membrane&#8208;Electrode&#8208;Assembly CO Electrolysis</title>

Membrane&#8208;electrode assembly&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has shown the ability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. This study explored the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on COE, focusing on pH and anodic oxidation. Using 0.5 m K2CO3, we achieved high partial current densities for ethanol and propanol, highlighting the importance of minimizing anodic oxidation.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly (MEA)&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has demonstrated the capability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. However, most studies on COE have achieved performance benchmarks under strongly alkaline conditions (e.g., &#8805;1&#160;m KOH, pH&#160;&#8805;14), raising the question of whether such high pH levels are essential for optimal performance. In this study, we investigated the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on MEA&#8208;based CO electrolysis, focusing on the influence of pH and the impact of anodic oxidation on the selectivity of various liquid products. By adjusting electrolyte concentration and pH, we achieved significant partial current densities for ethanol (189 &#177; 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and propanol (89 &#177; 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using 0.5&#160;M K2CO3. This high performance is attributed to the creation of a moderate local alkaline environment and the relatively high resistance to anodic oxidation. Additionally, durability measurements emphasized the critical importance of eliminating anodic oxidation to optimize MEA&#8208;based COE for ethanol and propanol production.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Ni@TiN/CNT Heterostructure with Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni@TiN/CNT heterostructure is constructed by combining a molten salt etching strategy and CVD. The residual zero&#8208;dimension Ni NPs are cleverly used as the active site of NO2RR and the catalyst for CNT growth. Two&#8208;dimensional MXene&#8208;derived TiN exerts the tandem catalysis with residual Ni NPs. Meanwhile, 1D CNT enhances the durability of NO2RR through the chainmail effect.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) is considered a sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis strategy. However, there are still significant challenges in designing efficient NO2RR catalysts. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on MXene&#8208;derived TiN (Ni@TiN/CNT) heterostructure is constructed by combining molten salt etching strategy and chemical vapor deposition. Ni@TiN/CNT exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate (15.6&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), Faradaic efficiency (95.6%), and record cycle stability (NO2RR performance is virtually unattenuated after 60 cycles) at &#8722;0.7&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE). In addition, the Zn&#8208;nitrite battery with Ni@TiN/CNT as the cathode shows high power density (9.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and NH3 synthesis performance. Combining validation experiments and density functional theory calculations reveals that Ni@TiN/CNT follows the tandem catalytic mechanism. The TiN site preferentially adsorbs and activates NO2&#8722;, while the Ni site provides abundant active hydrogen for the subsequent reduction process. Meanwhile, the chainmail structure of CNT prevents the oxidation and leaching of active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of Ni@TiN/CNT. This work provides a new inspiration for the preparation of durable and efficient NO2RR electrocatalysts with tandem catalytic sites.

         <title>Leveraging Noncovalent Interactions for the Binding of CO by a Weakly Lewis Acidic Borane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. Exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to carbon monoxide under mild conditions (1 bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5 kcal mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Known boron carbonyl complexes either exploit very high Lewis acidity or a low oxidation state boron centre in order to capture CO. By contrast, we report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. {(Ph2P)xanth}3B features a solid&#8208;state structure in which two of the three B&#8208;bound xanth(PPh2) units are projected above the BC3 plane, generating an up, up, down conformation. Quantum chemical methods, however, reveal that the alternative up, up, up alignment, characterized by a cage&#8208;like geometry and enhanced intramolecular noncovalent interactions, is favored significantly in silico (by ca. 33.0&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Although this conformation is optimal for binding polar C3&#8208;symmetric H&#8208;bond donors such as NH3 (and related guests such as H2O and MeNH2) the binding of essentially nonpolar substrates such as CO would be expected to be weak at best. However, exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to CO under mild conditions (1&#160;bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO, a tractable cage&#8208;like borane carbonyl adduct featuring a central BCO moiety shrouded by xanth(PPh2) moieties. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Oxindole Photochromic Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photochromic azobenzene&#8208;oxindole dyad is reported. The combination of the two switches promotes drastic molecular geometry changes and allows for precise NMR quantification. This enables the study of the photokinetic behavior under different irradiation conditions and the discovery of a unique photokinetic relationship between the two photoswitches.








Abstract
Manipulation of molecular geometry using photoresponsive units is a powerful tool in supramolecular chemistry, smart materials, and photopharmacology. Current synthetic chemistry offers many responsive molecules that perform such a task. However, the incorporation of various photoresponsive units in a single molecule to achieve several geometrical changes remains scarce, particularly when they are in close proximity. The development of such systems is limited by challenges arising from selectively addressing the photoresponsive moieties and the analysis of complex mixtures. Here, we overcome these challenges by constructing a novel hetero&#8208;photochromic azobenzene&#8208;oxindole dyad (AOD).

&lt;p&gt;A novel photochromic azobenzene-oxindole dyad is reported. The combination of the two switches promotes drastic molecular geometry changes and allows for precise NMR quantification. This enables the study of the photokinetic behavior under different irradiation conditions and the discovery of a unique photokinetic relationship between the two photoswitches.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of molecular geometry using photoresponsive units is a powerful tool in supramolecular chemistry, smart materials, and photopharmacology. Current synthetic chemistry offers many responsive molecules that perform such a task. However, the incorporation of various photoresponsive units in a single molecule to achieve several geometrical changes remains scarce, particularly when they are in close proximity. The development of such systems is limited by challenges arising from selectively addressing the photoresponsive moieties and the analysis of complex mixtures. Here, we overcome these challenges by constructing a novel hetero-photochromic azobenzene-oxindole dyad (AOD). Both chromophores can be addressed and quantified in solution by in situ NMR irradiation analysis. Additionally, this method allows us to unravel the intricate photokinetic relationships between the two chromophores, leading to the observation of an unprecedented molecular motion: an azobenzene &lt;i&gt;E&#160;&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&#160;&lt;i&gt;Z&#160;&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&#160;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; isomerization at a single wavelength due to the oxindole influence. By functionalizing the azobenzene ring, we showed that the responsiveness of the system is maintained in seven distinct AODs. Overall, the photochromic dyad offers dramatic geometrical changes over its four isomers, making it a useful tool for further applications in which such behavior is desired, such as host-guest systems, responsive materials, photopharmacology, and molecular machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Quantification of Neuroprotective Effect of Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst on Neurochemical Transmission by Multi&#8208;Spatiotemporal Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroprotective effects of single&#8208;atom catalysts on neurochemical transmission have been quantified by multi&#8208;spatiotemporal electrochemistry including in vivo analysis and single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA). This study uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying neuroprotection of single&#8208;atom nanozyme at multiple levels, offering new insights into therapeutic strategies of restoring dopamine release for brain disorders and injuries.








Abstract
Maintaining redox homeostasis through biocatalytic reactions has emerged as a widely studied neuroprotective strategy for various brain disorders and injuries. However, current research on neuroprotection primarily focuses on functional and behavioral assessments. The impact of neuroprotective interventions on neurotransmission, a critical function of the central nervous system (CNS), remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first direct evidence for neuroprotective effect on neurochemical transmission by multi&#8208;spatiotemporal electrochemistry. We employed in vivo and single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry to quantitatively evaluate the neuroprotective effect of an antioxidative Fe single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe1/NC SAzyme) on neurotransmission, using a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium (MPP+)&#8208;induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model. In the PD animal model, Fe1/NC SAzyme mitigates MPP+ neurotoxicity by decreasing damage to dopaminergic neurons, increasing evoked dopamine release, attenuating spontaneous firing, and alleviating locomotor impairment. At the single&#8208;cell level, pretreatment with Fe1/NC SAzyme inhibits MPP+ effects by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), increasing cell viability and ATP concentration, and enhancing the exocytotic release. This study not only provides a research paradigm for directly quantifying therapeutic mechanisms of brain disorders and injury but also reinforces a novel neuroprotective strategy through modulating the redox homeostasis with biocatalytic reactions.

The decarboxylative oxygenation of amino acid derivatives and short peptides was achieved to access imides or amides via photoinduced intermolecular charge transfer through chalcogen bonding interactions. This innovative method was featured by employing Lewis basic diphenyl diselenide as a Lewis acid catalyst.








Abstract
Here we report a photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative oxygenation of amino acid derivatives and short peptides using dioxygen as a green oxidant. A reverse catalytic strategy utilizing Lewis basic diphenyl diselenide as a Lewis acid catalyst to activate carboxylic acid via chalcogen bonding interaction is the key to this work. This synthetic method is tolerant of functionalities present in both natural and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, enabling the efficient synthesis of C&#8208;terminal amides or imides. Mechanistic studies suggest there is a dual noncovalent interaction between diphenyl diselenide and carboxylic acid, which allows radical decarboxylation through photoinduced intermolecular electron transfer. This new activation mode of carboxylic acids will add a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.

A novel titanium phosphate, Ti2O3(H2PO4)2&#183;2H2O, is introduced as a metal&#8208;free anode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) with a remarkably low discharge potential of 0.17&#160;V (vs. Zn2+/Zn). The TOHPO&#8208;based full cell demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 94% of its capacity after an impressive 50,000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of metal&#8208;free anodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.








Abstract
The application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) with Zn metal anode is hindered by severe dendritic growth, corrosion, and inefficient Zn utilization. &#8220;Rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; type AZIBs are considered a viable approach toward practical applications due to the success of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries employing intercalated graphite anodes. Herein, a new type of layered titanium phosphate Ti2O3(H2PO4)2&#183;2H2O is proposed for the first time as the intercalated anodes for AZIBs, exhibiting a capacity of 108&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, with a low discharge potential of 0.17&#160;V (vs. Zn2+/Zn). The ion insertion process is thoroughly investigated, and a micro&#8208;dendrite growth&#8208;corrosion mode is proposed to explain the capacity degradation mechanism. Corresponding countermeasures are designed, resulting in a significant improvement in cycle life. When coupled with a zinc hexacyanoferrate (KZnHCF) cathode, the &#8220;rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; full battery exhibits an ultralong lifespan of 50000 cycles (111 days) at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 with 94% capacity retention. This work presents a novel perspective for the development of practical AZIBs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Density Covalent Organic Framework Sponges with Exceptional Compression and Functional Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction method for the hierarchical porous covalent organic framework (COF) sponges with hollow cell walls through a template&#8208;assisted framework solvothermal process is shown. The COF sponges exhibit ultralow density (2.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), high surface area (1655&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and unprecedented compression performance (demonstrated by only a 7.9% decrease in height and a 7.1% decrease in stress after 300 000 compressions at 50% strain). Excellent performance and reusability in organic solvent absorption and organic catalysis are demonstrated.








Abstract
The emergence of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) macroscopic objects with hierarchical porous structures addresses the limitations of traditional COF powders, which are challenging to process, thus bringing them closer to practical applications. However, the brittleness of the parent COF powder results in poor mechanical stability of these COF macroscopic objects, presenting a significant challenge that must be overcome for their continued development. In this work, we successfully obtained a continuous, hierarchically porous, and interconnected open&#8208;cell COF structure made up of hollow sponge walls of thickness 100&#8211;250&#160;nm through a template&#8208;assisted framework process. This unique structure endows the COF sponge with a high surface area (1655&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), ultralow density (2.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and exceptional mechanical stability. Even after 300 000 compressions at a 50% compression rate, its stress and height decreased by only 7.9% and 7.1%, respectively. These properties grant the COF sponge excellent solvent absorption capacity, catalytic performance, and reusability. Therefore, this work broadens the development pathway for COF macroscopic objects and is expected to further unlock the potential of COFs in practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) macroscopic objects with hierarchical porous structures addresses the limitations of traditional COF powders, which are challenging to process, thus bringing them closer to practical applications. However, the brittleness of the parent COF powder results in poor mechanical stability of these COF macroscopic objects, presenting a significant challenge that must be overcome for their continued development. In this work, we successfully obtained a continuous, hierarchically porous, and interconnected open-cell COF structure made up of hollow sponge walls of thickness 100&#8211;250&#160;nm through a template-assisted framework process. This unique structure endows the COF sponge with a high surface area (1655&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultralow density (2.2&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and exceptional mechanical stability. Even after 300 000 compressions at a 50% compression rate, its stress and height decreased by only 7.9% and 7.1%, respectively. These properties grant the COF sponge excellent solvent absorption capacity, catalytic performance, and reusability. Therefore, this work broadens the development pathway for COF macroscopic objects and is expected to further unlock the potential of COFs in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene: A novel method to facilitate rapid access to the otherwise inaccessible conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif is reported.








Abstract
Intercepting reactions have recently emerged as an innovative approach in organic synthesis, allowing chemists to harness reactive intermediates to access structures and functionalities that conventional methods cannot easily achieve. By deliberately manipulating reaction pathways, this strategy provides a unique avenue to explore unusual reactivities and complex molecular architectures. In this work, we have developed a new protocol for the nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation reaction (NuBFr). Employing tropone oxime tosylate &#8211; a simple and readily accessible precursor&#160;&#8211;&#160;and a diverse set of nucleophiles generated in situ from alcohols, phenols, thiols and alkynes with strong bases, we successfully synthesized a library of novel conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitrile derivatives. This method facilitates rapid access to the conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif, a structural feature rarely encountered in synthetic chemistry. Our computational studies indicate that the NuBFr reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bicylic azirine intermediate. The resulting Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitriles could undergo an unprecedented thermally induced 8&#960;/6&#960;/4&#960; electrocyclization cascade sequence to produce trisubstituted olefins. This sequence underscores the fundamental value of these motifs in pushing the boundaries of unusual reactivities in organic synthesis.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed a type of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COF&#8208;based photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS to produce H2 and O2. Attributed to its higher water vapor harvesting ability, the Pt@DHTA&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF with two C&#9552;O groups in the aldehyde section showed a better visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS activity. Further characterizations indicate that the carbonyl&#8208;O and pyridine&#8208;N atoms in COF serve as water&#8208;absorbing sites, and the pyridine&#8208;N heteroatoms facilitate the OER process in photocatalytic reactions by reducing the Gibbs free energy barrier.








Abstract
Photocatalytic overall water vapor splitting (OWVS) into H2 and O2 not only owns the potential of avoiding the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction reforming H2O, but also realizes H2 production without available liquid water. However, this attempt is still a blank due to the weak absorption of photocatalysts to water vapor. Herein, we report the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS by combining the water&#8208;adsorbing ability and photocatalytic activity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The overall water splitting (OWS) activity of Tp&#8208;COF skeleton was realized by introducing tripyridyltriazine segment. The Pt@Tp&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF achieves high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates (HER and OER) of 148.4 and 74.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, respectively. Under water vapor conditions with diverse relative humidities (RHs), the Pt@Tp&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF could drive OWVS even without backward reaction. By further optimizing the structure of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine section, it was found that the Pt@DHTA&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF showed optimal OWVS activity, with the H2 and O2 evolution rate of 51.2 and 25.6&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under RH&#160;=&#160;88%, respectively. The advantage of OWVS compared to traditional solid&#8211;liquid OWS was further confirmed by a continuous activity test of 45&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations indicated that carbonyl&#8208;O and pyridine&#8208;N atoms in COFs serve as water&#8208;absorbing sites, and the absorbed water molecules could promote water&#8208;splitting activity of active sites in COFs simultaneously.

         <dc:description>
Three imino&#8208;pyrrole zinc (II) catalysts were prepared and applied to the chemical recycling of PLA, PET, and BPA&#8208;PC. Rapid PLA degradation was accomplished in solution and under solvent&#8208;free conditions, the latter giving full conversion at relatively mild temperatures after 11 min. Mixed plastic feedstock experiments were carried out, including the first example of sequential PLA/BPA&#8208;PC methanolysis using a single catalyst, with selectivity controlled by temperature.








Abstract
Three imino&#8208;pyrrole zinc complexes were prepared and applied to the rapid degradation of polylactic acid (PLA) and the depolymerization of bisphenol A polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PLA alcoholysis proceeded rapidly at a range of conditions, including reflux in air. Remarkable activity was demonstrated for the solvent&#8208;free methanolysis of PLA at mild conditions with full conversion reached in 11 min at 80&#160;&#176;C. Various conditions were investigated including a range of PLA sources and, importantly, catalyst recycling was demonstrated. The methanolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and the glycolysis of PET were achieved, the latter giving full conversion after 1.5 h for all catalysts. The chemical recycling of mixed plastic feedstocks was investigated, including the selective and sequential degradation of a PLA/BPA&#8208;PC mixture with a single catalyst and solvent.

         <title>Construction of Multistep Charge Transfer Pathways in Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 for Significantly Accelerated Photoconversion of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach integrating multistep charge transfer pathways and heat&#8208;driven reactions is designed to convert waste polypropylene into CO and CH3COOH, both widely used in industry as essential chemical feedstocks. Under light irradiation, polypropylene thermally decomposes into C4 molecules due to the heat generated by the SPR effect of Bi0; C4 molecules are adsorbed onto the surface of the Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 and attacked by &#183;O2&#8722;, leading to their photoconversion into CO and CH3COOH. This study provides a new strategy for achieving high&#8208;value recycling of waste plastics through photocatalysis under mild conditions.








Abstract
Photoconversion of waste plastics into valuable CO and CH3COOH represents a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for addressing plastic pollution issues. However, this process currently encounters significant challenges, primarily due to the limitation of catalyst activity and the difficulty in breaking C&#9472;C bonds. Herein, we present a novel approach that integrates multistep charge transfer pathways with photothermal&#8208;driven reactions to improve photoconversion efficiency. By incorporating Bi0/Bi3+ metal as an electron transport mediator for multistep charge transfer, we markedly enhanced the separation and transport of photoelectrons, thereby accelerating the generation of active species. Meanwhile, the heat generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi0 drove the reactions related to the photoconversion of polypropylene. Subsequently, the photoconversion rates of PP into CO by Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 reached 209.41&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, which is 27.55 times higher than that achieved with KNbO3. Furthermore, the dual Bi&#8211;Nb sites effectively stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, thereby promoting the production of CH3COOH at a rate of 213.00&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. This strategy of boosting photoconversion activity of PP into CO and CH3COOH offers an effective green solution to the serious issue of plastic pollution.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoconversion of waste plastics into valuable CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH represents a ground-breaking strategy for addressing plastic pollution issues. However, this process currently encounters significant challenges, primarily due to the limitation of catalyst activity and the difficulty in breaking C&#9472;C bonds. Herein, we present a novel approach that integrates multistep charge transfer pathways with photothermal-driven reactions to improve photoconversion efficiency. By incorporating Bi&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; metal as an electron transport mediator for multistep charge transfer, we markedly enhanced the separation and transport of photoelectrons, thereby accelerating the generation of active species. Meanwhile, the heat generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; drove the reactions related to the photoconversion of polypropylene. Subsequently, the photoconversion rates of PP into CO by Bi&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;@Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-KNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reached 209.41&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 27.55 times higher than that achieved with KNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the dual Bi&#8211;Nb sites effectively stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, thereby promoting the production of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH at a rate of 213.00&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This strategy of boosting photoconversion activity of PP into CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH offers an effective green solution to the serious issue of plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Compacting Molecular Stacking and Inhibiting Self&#8208;Aggregation in Fullerene Transporting Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed and blended with PCBM to increase crystallinity, compact molecular stacking, and improve the compatibility of electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The FuPE:PCBM blend presents higher electron mobility, more complete coverage, and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation, and thus enables PSCs to achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies up to 26% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
The underdevelopment of electron transport layer (ETL) materials remains a critical bottleneck limiting the overall photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Fullerene derivatives, such as PCBM, are widely employed ETL materials in PSCs due to their excellent electron affinity and energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. However, PCBM suffers from high energy disorder, self&#8208;aggregation predilection, and insufficient defect passivation ability, leading to significant charge carrier recombination and accumulation at interfaces. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed to enhance the performance of PCBM&#8208;based ETLs for PSCs. Incorporating FuPE efficiently compacts molecular stacking, enforces crystallinity and intermolecular interaction, suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, and improves interfacial compatibility of the FuPE:PCBM blend. Such endows the FuPE:PCBM blend film with enhanced electron mobility (0.183&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), lower trap density, more uniform film morphology, and superior defect&#8208;passivation ability, compared to the PCBM pristine one. Consequently, PSCs employing FuPE:PCBM as the ETL achieve reduced trap&#8208;assisted recombination, enhanced charge carrier extraction, and thus a remarkable power conversion efficiency exceeding 26% alongside improved operational stability. This work highlights an effective strategy for optimizing fullerene&#8208;based ETLs, advancing the development of highly efficient and durable PSCs.

         <title>Novel Light&#8208;Promoted Bioorthogonal Reaction via Molecular Recombination for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyrrole and Its Application in In Vitro and In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel light&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal multifunctionalized molecular recombination (LBMR) reaction that can facilitate the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles under normal physiological conditions. The LBMR reaction exhibited rapid kinetics, high efficiency, a wide substrate scope, and the potential for fluorescence imaging on different types of cells and zebrafish.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized organic, medicinal, and biochemical research by designing and developing selective and rapid reactions that do not interfere with biological processes. Despite significant advancements, the existing bioorthogonal reactions can normally introduce only one functional group to a biomolecule, limiting their versatility in biological systems. In this study, we report a novel light&#8208;promoting reaction, namely light&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal multifunctionalized molecular recombination (LBMR) reaction, that can facilitate the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles via molecular editing and recombination of isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate and isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The proposed LBMR reaction exhibited rapid kinetics, high efficiency, wide substrate scope, and the potential for in situ fluorescence imaging under normal physiological conditions without the need for a catalyst. The LBMR reaction allowed incorporating multiple functional groups and using well&#8208;soluble carboxylic salts as bioorthogonal substrates. The in vitro experiments performed in different types of cells and the in vivo studies performed on zebrafish demonstrated the potential applicability of the proposed LBMR for biological imaging. This work not only introduces a new photo&#8208;bioorthogonal reaction paradigm but also expands the scope of bioorthogonal chemistry, paving the way for future applications in biomedical research.

         <title>A Triatomic Cobalt Catalyst for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an ultrafast printing technique, we have successfully embedded triatomic cobalt cluster precursors into graphene nanosheets, resulting in a triatomic Co3&#8208;NG catalyst with excellent bifunctional OER/ORR activity. The triangular pyramidal active sites effectively regulate the d&#8208;band center and electronic structure and promote the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates.








Abstract
The advancement of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries significantly depends on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to provide outstanding oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance. However, it is still challenging to design electrocatalysts with excellent bifunctional activity and stability. Here, we adopt an ultrafast printing method to efficiently embed a triatom cobalt complex precursor onto graphene nanosheets to obtain a triatomic catalyst (Co3&#8208;NG), exhibiting a durable and excellent bifunctional catalyst in the electrocatalytic ORR (Ehalf&#8208;wave&#160;=&#160;0.903&#8201;V) and OER (Ej&#160;=&#160;10&#160;=&#160;1.596&#8201;V). The Co3&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8211;air battery can output a maximum power density of 189.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 330&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and can be charged and discharged over 3000 cycles, significantly outperforming the Pt/C&#160;+&#160;RuO2 benchmark (146.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 360 cycles) under testing conditions of 25 &#176;C. In situ XAS analysis and theoretical calculations disclose that Co3ON6 is the catalytic site for bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis. The constructed triangular pyramidal active sites effectively regulate the d&#8208;band center and electronic configuration and promote the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. This work uncovers that the geometry and electronic structure of triatomic active centers play a key role in improving bifunctional ORR/OER performance for electrochemical energy applications.

         <title>Synthetic Reversible Fibrous Network Hydrogels Based on a Double&#8208;Helical Polyelectrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study first reports a reversible fibrous network hydrogel based on double&#8208;helix polyelectrolytes and elucidates its formation process and key influencing factors. Owing to its rapid gelation, the hydrogel enables vertical spraying on inert surfaces. Furthermore, its unique properties make it highly promising for applications in antimicrobial fabric coatings and wildfire suppression.








Abstract
The unique mechanical properties of fibrous networks in biological tissues have inspired the development of synthetic fibrous network hydrogels, yet few polymers can reversibly form such structures. Here, we report the first reversible fibrous network hydrogel composed of synthetic polyelectrolytes with extremely rigid conformation (persistence length is &#8764;1&#160;&#181;m), made up of double&#8208;helical poly(2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P4444]Br). The hydrogel exhibits a unique sol&#8211;gel transition, triggered by the hydrophobicity increase of [P4444]Br above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This drives PBDT aggregation into fibrous bundles through electrostatic interactions. These bundles grow and branch into a continuous network, with the molecular rigidity of PBDT's double&#8208;helix conformation being key to gel formation. The hydrogel displays strain&#8208;stiffening mechanical responses akin to biological systems and shows a significant hysteresis (21 &#176;C) between heating and cooling cycles. Uniquely, the effects of salts on the transition temperature deviate from the Hofmeister series, highlighting coordination with sulfonate groups as the dominant factor. Leveraging its modulus change during gelation, the hydrogel was successfully applied as a spray coating on superhydrophobic vertical Teflon surfaces. This study broadens the scope of thermoreversible hydrogels introducing gelation mechanisms for rigid polyelectrolytes and demonstrates their potential in advanced coatings.

Here, we report the first reversible fibrous network hydrogel composed of synthetic polyelectrolytes with extremely rigid conformation (persistence length is &#8764;1&#160;&#181;m), made up of double-helical poly(2,2&#8242;-disulfonyl-4,4&#8242;-benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P&lt;sub&gt;4444&lt;/sub&gt;]Br). The hydrogel exhibits a unique sol&#8211;gel transition, triggered by the hydrophobicity increase of [P&lt;sub&gt;4444&lt;/sub&gt;]Br above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This drives PBDT aggregation into fibrous bundles through electrostatic interactions. These bundles grow and branch into a continuous network, with the molecular rigidity of PBDT's double-helix conformation being key to gel formation. The hydrogel displays strain-stiffening mechanical responses akin to biological systems and shows a significant hysteresis (21 &#176;C) between heating and cooling cycles. Uniquely, the effects of salts on the transition temperature deviate from the Hofmeister series, highlighting coordination with sulfonate groups as the dominant factor. Leveraging its modulus change during gelation, the hydrogel was successfully applied as a spray coating on superhydrophobic vertical Teflon surfaces. This study broadens the scope of thermoreversible hydrogels introducing gelation mechanisms for rigid polyelectrolytes and demonstrates their potential in advanced coatings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Molecular Recognition for Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Mediated Reversible Photochemical Control Over mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule ligand undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamer in a selective manner, dependent on both the RNA sequence/structure and ligand chemical structure. A caged mRNA construct incorporating the PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or p53 coding sequence remained translationally repressed until exposure to 302&#160;nm light, which cleaved the photocage and restored translation in vitro and in cells, enabling precise photochemical control of both wild type and reporter gene expression.








Abstract
Chemical probes that control the function of complex RNA molecules offer unique opportunities to interrogate biological systems. In this study, we demonstrate that a small molecule ligand selectively recognizes and undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamers. This effect is selective and dependent on both the chemical structure and RNA sequence/structure. A homogeneously modified, caged mRNA construct containing a PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or wild type p53 coding sequence displayed repressed translation in vitro or in cells until irradiated with 302&#160;nm light, resulting in cleavage of the photocage and restoration of translation. This method demonstrates for the first time that aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition of a small molecule ligand can be used to precisely and photochemically activate the translation of a complex mRNA in cells.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Deacylative Functionalization toward &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioconvergent quaternary&#8208;to&#8208;quaternary synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral nitriles has been enabled. By replacing the acyl group with a variety of allyl, propargyl, and benzyl motifs, the functional group swap can convert easily available &#946;&#8208;ketonitriles to assorted quaternary stereocenters en route to bioactive molecules of broad interests.








Abstract
The use of readily available prochiral or racemic quaternary carbons to access enantioenriched ones offers a promising alternative to conventional synthesis from tertiary or planar substrates. Unlike desymmetrization, which modifies an existing substituent with limited reactivity, a functional group swap can install a new motif, which is structurally distinct and nonderivable from the replaced group. However, achieving enantioconvergence in these quaternary&#8208;to&#8208;quaternary transformations is challenging, especially for acyclic stereocenters. Here, we report that acyl groups of &#946;&#8208;ketonitriles can be stereoselectively replaced by allyl, propargyl, or benzyl moieties using easily accessible alcohols under palladium catalysis. The deacylative functionalization proceeds through a retro&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type elimination of ketonitrile with alkoxide and the absence of diastereoisomerism in the resulting ketenimine anion assists the subsequent asymmetric addition. Together with the pair of &#945;&#8208;substituents, the retained nitrile and the incoming alkyl motif instill significant derivatization potential into the enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Docking Effect Enabling Rechargeable High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium&#8211;Iodine/Chlorine Battery</title>

Halogen ion&#8208;docking effect with solvation&#8208;dependent reaction unlocks high&#8208;energy&#8208;density magnesium batteries, featuring remarkable discharge plateau voltage (3.0&#160;V), high capacity (404&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), ultra&#8208;fast charging (20C), and low&#8208;temperature cycling (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries represent a promising energy storage system by offering low cost and dendrite&#8208;less propensity. However, the limited selection of cathode materials, and often with low voltage and capacity, constrain Mg batteries. Herein, by exploiting the ion&#8208;docking effect between two halogen species&#8212;iodine cations (I+) and chlorine anions (Cl&#8722;)&#8212;we activate the cathodic activity of halogens and develop a magnesium&#8211;iodine/chlorine (Mg&#8208;I/Cl) battery prototype with high energy and power density. The ion&#8208;docking effect enables I+ and Cl&#8722; to mutually balance and disperse their charges, and weakens the coordination strength between Cl&#8722; and Mg2+ while enhancing the stability of I+, thus facilitating the multi&#8208;electron (2&#160;+&#160;1/3) redox reactions of halogens. We also find the solvation state of iodine species determines the reaction process of the I0/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox couples. The here&#8208;developed magnesium&#8211;iodine/chlorine battery features an impressively high discharge plateau of up to 3.0&#160;V with a high capacity exceeding 400&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and demonstrates a stable lifespan for 500 cycles, with the ability of ultra&#8208;fast charging at 20C and low&#8208;temperature cycling under &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. These findings may provide new insights for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Mg battery systems.

         <title>Reactive Hydrogen Species Behaviors on Pd/TiN: In Situ SERS Guided Regulation for Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>

Screening Pd catalysts with D2. Through in situ Raman tracing the &#957;N&#8208;D and &#957;Pd&#8208;D on SiO2@Pd@TiN@Pd, a clear Pd site structure&#8208;D2 dissociation/migration behavior relationship is observed. This enables the screening of Pd/TiN catalysts with the desired Pd structure for effective chemoselective hydrogenation using D2 as a probe.








Abstract
Uncovering the H2 dissociation and H&#8208;spillover behaviors of the generated reactive hydrogen species on catalyst surfaces is crucial for achieving efficient and chemoselective hydrogenation. However, those behaviors remain largely elusive given the challenges of directly observing H atoms, the smallest atoms in the element table. Herein, we explored the Pd site&#8211;specific D2 cleavage and the H&#8208;spillover behaviors of dissociated D on the titanium nitride (TiN) support via in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopically (SERS). Besides facilitated forming Pd single atom (Pd1), fully exposed Pd cluster (Pdn) and Pd nanoparticles, dissociated D2 on Pd sites (indicated by &#957;Pd&#8211;D at 1,800&#160;cm&#8722;1), spillover to TiN, and formation of the N&#9472;D bond (indicated by &#957;N&#8211;D at 2,400&#160;cm&#8722;1) were spectroscopically traceable. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, Pdn is identified as the most favorable site for the provision of reactive H through hydrogen spillover. Moreover, we propose &#957;Pd&#8208;D and the &#957;N&#8208;D/&#957;Pd&#8208;D ratio as the index to relative amounts of Pd1 and Pdn sites, respectively, and develop an in situ SERS&#8208;based method to study the synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;activity relationship of Pd/TiN catalyst with an optimized structure for chemoselective hydrogenation.

         <title>Simple Boron&#8211;Nitrogen Covalent Bond Constructs Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters: Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging a &#960;&#8208;extended BN&#8208;bond framework, we developed a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter using a lithium&#8208;free, amine&#8208;directed borylation strategy. The emitter exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission band (FWHM = 13&#160;nm) and efficient reverse intersystem crossing, consequently affording a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 30% at CIE coordinates of (0.155, 0.060) in the device.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency, pure deep&#8208;blue emitters are critically needed to meet the rising demands of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Although high&#8208;order B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) leveraging multi&#8208;resonance (MR) effects show promise, their complex syntheses and large molecular weights hinder practical application. Here, we report a compact MR framework featuring three nitrogen&#8208;linked boron centers, synthesized at the gram scale via a single&#8208;step, amine&#8208;directed borylation. This emitter displays deep&#8208;blue emission with an ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 13&#160;nm and achieves an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) compared to previous BN&#8208;bond&#8208;based blue MR emitters. Theoretical studies reveal that its &#960;&#8208;extended framework and partially distorted geometry synergistically minimize structural relaxation to reduce FWHM and enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling to facilitate efficient spin&#8208;flip processes. As a result, the corresponding deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an FWHM of 15&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;EQE,max) approaching 30% at color coordinates of (0.155, 0.060), rivaling the leading performance of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs based on conventional B/N&#8208;doped frameworks.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Fluoride Dual&#8208;atom Synergistic Regulated Interface Coating Enables Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8722;fluoride dual&#8208;atom&#8208;regulated solid electrolyte interphase coating on Zn anodes (ZnBOF/Zn) is presented, which introduces a unique synergy between B&#8208;compound protective layers and zincophilic F atoms. This dual regulation not only ensures preferential Zn deposition along the (002) plane, thereby mitigating dendrite growth, but also suppresses side reactions and accelerates Zn2+ desolvation for enhanced electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries provide promising opportunities for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, Zn anode encounters severe challenges, such as Zn dendrite formation, surface corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a strategy to spontaneously construct a boron&#8722;fluoride dual&#8208;atom regulated SEI (ZnBOF), which involves the formation of a B&#8208;compound coating through an etching process followed by an in situ F substitution during the initial electrochemical cycling. The ZnBOF/Zn anode benefits preferential deposition of Zn2+ along the (002) plane without Zn dendrite, and the side reactions including by&#8208;product and HER are dramatically suppressed. A combination of characterization methods, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, shows that the B&#8208;containing passivation layer facilitates the transport of Zn2+ and mitigates water&#8208;related side reactions, and the F atoms serve as zincophilic sites that enhance the transfer kinetics of Zn2+. As expected, the well&#8208;designed ZnBOF/Zn anode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping for 5000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled ZnBOF/Zn||MnO2 batteries show impressive cycling stability, remaining 96.2% of the initial capacity (234.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) after 1700 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Therefore, this work reveals a dual&#8208;atom synergistic regulated strategy to fabricate a robust SEI for Zn anode, which contributes to the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Integrating Electronic&#8208;Storage Piperazine into Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piperazine units were first adopted to construct catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reactions. The electronic&#8208;storage feature promoted the electrons transferring from the electrodes to active catalytic sites and thus contributed to high activity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in new environmental&#8208;friendly electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, their catalytic activity is hindered by inefficient electron transfer from electrodes to catalytic sites along extended frameworks. To overcome this bottleneck, herein, we first incorporated redox&#8208;active piperazine units into the COFs to catalyze ORR. The redox&#8208;active piperazine units enable to storage electrons, thus accelerate the electron transfer to the catalytic sites. Furthermore, the introduction of &#9472;OH group&#8208;containing building blocks induces keto&#8208;enol tautomerism (enabling reversible &#9472;OH / &#9472;C&#9552;O interconversion), improving framework polarity with a dipole moment of 6.87&#160;Debye (5.8 times increase compared to non&#8208;hydroxylated COFs). This polarity enhancement strengthens the intermediates binding ability, thereby improving the catalytic activity. As a result, the optimized PD&#8208;COF&#8208;OH exhibits a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#160;V, turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.045&#160;s&#8722;1, and electrochemically active surface area of 9.4&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal synergistic roles of &#9472;OH and &#9472;C&#9552;O groups in stabilizing OOH* and OH* intermediates, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. This work establishes a novel design paradigm for catalytic COFs through a rational integration of electron reservoir units and tautomerism&#8208;enabled polarity modulation.

To address critical environmental challenges caused by current recycling strategies of polymer wastes, our work presents water&#8208;degradable, malleable, environmentally responsive, and low&#8208;cost polymer networks synthesized via a Mannich&#8208;type reaction, offering a novel, scalable, and sustainable pathway for the next&#8208;generation polymers. 








Abstract
Polymer waste poses a significant environmental challenge, with current recycling strategies often hindered by inefficient waste collection systems, high production costs, and limited material recyclability. While extensive efforts have been directed toward upcycling or degrading commercial polymers, as well as developing sustainable alternatives, many approaches remain constrained by their reliance on harsh conditions, specialized catalysts, or complex processing methods. In this study, we present a novel strategy to address the challenges by developing mechanically robust polymer networks that are readily degradable in water within 30 days. Our approach leverages a guanidine&#8208;based Mannich&#8208;type reaction utilizing three low&#8208;cost starting materials&#8212;guanidine hydrochloride, aldehyde, and diamine&#8212;under mild conditions. Unlike traditional thermosets, which are often difficult to recycle, our polymer networks exhibit exceptional processability, enabling the fabrication of various forms, and demonstrate responsiveness to moisture. These properties, coupled with degradability, make them viable candidates for diverse applications. By introducing a scalable and sustainable pathway for designing next&#8208;generation recyclable polymers, our work advances the field of dynamic covalent chemistry and presents a novel class of sustainable polymer networks with significant potential for reducing environmental impact.

         <title>B &#8592; N Lewis Pair Fusion of N,N&#8208;Diaryldihydrophenazines: Effect on Structural, Electronic, and Emissive Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#9472;N Lewis pair fusion of N,N&#8208;dipyridyldihydrophenazine and its benzofused homologs results in steric constraints that enforce a bent structure in both the ground and excited states, reduces the antiaromatic character of the central dihydropyrazine heterocycle and promotes a quinoidal resonance structure, bathochromically shifts the absorption and emission bands, and induces aggregation induced emission enhancement.








Abstract
Doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with boron and/or nitrogen is emerging as a powerful tool to tailor the electronic structure and photophysical properties. As N&#8208;doped analogues of anthracene, N,N&#8208;dihydrophenazines play important roles as redox mediators, battery materials, luminophores, and photoredox catalysts. Although benzannulation has been used successfully as a structural constraint to control the excited state properties, fusion of the N&#8208;aryl groups to the phenazine backbone has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the first examples of dihydrophenazines, in which the N&#8208;aryl groups are fused to the phenazine backbone via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation. This results in structural rigidification, locking the molecules in a bent conformation, while also modulating the electronic structure through molecular polarization. B&#9472;N fusion in BNPz1&#8722;BNPz3 induces a quinoid resonance structure with significant C&#9472;N(py) double bond character and reduces the antiaromatic character of the central pyrazine ring. Borylation also lowers the HOMO/LUMO (highest occupied/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energies and engenders bathochromic shifts in the emission. Further rigidification in the solid state gives rise to enhanced emission quantum yields, consistent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) observed upon water addition to solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The demonstrated structural control and fine&#8208;tuning of optoelectronic properties are of great significance to potential applications as emissive materials and in photocatalysis.

         <title>Intercalation of Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes into 2D Hybrid Perovskites for Tailored Dual&#8208;Band Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation of transition&#8208;metal complexes into 2D hybrid lead&#8208;bromide perovskites is presented, enabling tailored dual&#8208;band emission. The material features distinct intralayer and interlayer photoluminescence pathways with tunable optical properties, showcasing its potential in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The recently emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead&#8208;halide perovskites are mostly templated by &#8220;inert&#8221; organic cations, limiting their light emission solely from the inorganic components. Using &#8220;optically active&#8221; organic cations can grant access to the coupling between the two luminescent components, potentially leading to new excitation and emission pathways. However, employing optically active organic cations requires delicate design and complicated synthesis. To circumvent these problems, transition&#8208;metal complexes (e.g., Cu2+ and Ni2+) were intercalated in 2D perovskites and reported, for the first time, the photoluminescence (PL) profiles. 2D perovskites incorporating transition&#8208;metal complexes can be considered a molecular &#8220;type II&#8221; heterostructure where the &#8220;conduction band&#8221; is localized on the complexes and the &#8220;valence band&#8221; on the haloplumbate layers. As evident in the absorption and PL spectra of the materials, the &#8220;type II&#8221; configuration allows inter&#8208;band transitions to occur in addition to intraband within 2D Pb&#9472;Br layers. This makes the material's PL excitation wavelength dependent, allowing activation of only inter&#8208;band or inter&#8208;band plus intraband transitions by certain wavelengths. As the transition&#8208;metal complexes are highly tunable, this extra variable renders 2D hybrid perovskites a fertile playground for PL engineering as desired outcome can be targeted through fine&#8208;tailoring of inorganic lattice structures and selection of complexes with specific electronic configuration.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Organic Electroluminescence with External Quantum Efficiency of 40% from Indolocarbazole&#8208;Embedded Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first indolocarbazole&#8208;embedded dual&#8208;boron&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TDAF) emitters with emission peaks below 500&#160;nm which employ meta&#8208;N&#8211;&#960;&#8211;N&#8208;type indolecarbazole as the core framework. These emitters exhibit remarkably ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 18&#160;nm in toluene solution. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDS) demonstrate excellent electroluminescent performance, with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.0% and FWHM of 21&#160;nm.








Abstract
The demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition display technology has spurred the prosperity of multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and high efficiency, making them highly promising candidates for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Indolocarbazole, a highly rigid aza&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon framework, has shown significant potential as a building block for constructing MR&#8208;TADF emitters with ultra&#8208;narrowband emission (&lt;20&#160;nm). However, it remains a great challenge to construct ultra&#8208;narrowband indolocarbazole&#8208;embedded MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emission maxima less than 500&#160;nm. Here, two MR&#8208;TADF emitters, DBN&#8208;amICz and DBN&#8208;bmICz, are constructed by adopting meta&#8208;N&#8211;&#960;&#8211;N&#8208;type indolocarbazole as core framework and achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband blue&#8211;green emission in toluene solution with peaks of both 490&#160;nm and FWHMs of 18 and 19&#160;nm, respectively. OLEDs incorporating emitters DBN&#8208;amICz and DBN&#8208;bmICz demonstrate excellent electroluminescence (EL) performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 40.1% and 35.5%, and FWHMs of 21 and 24&#160;nm, respectively. This study represents the first report of dual&#8208;boron&#8208;containing MR emitters derived from indolocarbazole with emission below 500&#160;nm, filling a gap in the development of indolocarbazole&#8208;embedded dual&#8208;boron&#8208;containing blue&#8211;green MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Anode Engineering with pH&#8208;Neutral Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Enabling Over 19% Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel p&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE)&#8208;based HTL with an optimized molecular design was developed, featuring an enhanced planar conformation and reduced density of states (DOS), which realized efficient charge transport. With POM4 doping, the constructed OSCs achieved a high PCE of 19.16%. This work demonstrates CPE&#8208;based HTLs as promising acid&#8208;free HTL alternatives for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
The lack of effective hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) materials has become a significant bottleneck in the advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, to obtain sufficient doping properties, most HTLs have to be used by mixing with substantial amounts of acid, which causes serious corrosion problems. Herein, by optimizing molecular conformation, we designed and synthesized two conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) that exhibited superior hole&#8208;transporting capability without involving acid addition. The PEP&#8208;BT features a planar conjugated backbone constructed from the nonfused segment, which leads to an enhanced doping effect and highly ordered molecular arrangement. and reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking from 4.13 to 3.85&#160;&#197;. These contributed to the outstanding hole collection performance of polyoxometalate&#8208;doped PEP&#8208;BT:POM4 while maintaining a neutral pH. The binary OSC showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 19.16%, illustrating an unprecedented example that a CPE&#8208;based HTL can provide a photovoltaic efficiency exceeding 19% in OSCs. Moreover, as another evidence of high&#8208;performance HTL, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode incorporating PEP&#8208;BT:POM4 exhibited a superior luminous efficiency to the reference device, along with a decrease of 0.4&#160;V for turn&#8208;on voltage. The results from this work demonstrate the great potential of CPEs as HTL materials.

The PEP-BT features a planar conjugated backbone constructed from the nonfused segment, which leads to an enhanced doping effect and highly ordered molecular arrangement. and reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking from 4.13 to 3.85&#160;&#197;. These contributed to the outstanding hole collection performance of polyoxometalate-doped PEP-BT:POM4 while maintaining a neutral pH. The binary OSC showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 19.16%, illustrating an unprecedented example that a CPE-based HTL can provide a photovoltaic efficiency exceeding 19% in OSCs. Moreover, as another evidence of high-performance HTL, the organic light-emitting diode incorporating PEP-BT:POM4 exhibited a superior luminous efficiency to the reference device, along with a decrease of 0.4&#160;V for turn-on voltage. The results from this work demonstrate the great potential of CPEs as HTL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Theophylline to Adenine or preQ1: Repurposing a DNA Aptamer Revealed by Crystal Structure Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unveil the crystal structures of the theophylline DNA aptamer bound to various ligands. Structural analysis pinpointed essential nucleotides for ligand binding, enabling the redesign and experimental validation of an adenine&#8208;targeted DNA aptamer.








Abstract
Aptamers, which are short, single&#8208;stranded DNA or RNA, are capable of binding to a wide array of targets with exceptional selectivity. Those with high affinity for theophylline have the potential to serve as biosensors, crucial for tracking theophylline levels in the treatment of respiratory conditions. Despite the extensive structural characterization of the RNA theophylline aptamer, the DNA counterpart's ligand&#8208;recognition mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we elucidate the DNA theophylline aptamer's ligand&#8208;binding mechanism through high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of its complexes with theophylline, 3&#8208;methylxanthine, and hypoxanthine. Guided by these structural insights, we computationally redesigned the theophylline&#8208;binding pocket via rational mutagenesis of key nucleotides, generating novel aptamers selective for adenine and prequeuosine (preQ1) ligands. These engineered aptamers were validated through biochemical and crystallographic analyses. By integrating structural biology with computational design, our work provides a relatively simple and effective method for developing new aptamers. While this strategy does not supplant SELEX, it serves as a beneficial complement to it.

         <title>Efficient Nickel Precatalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Chlorides and Arylboronic Acids Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and catalytic properties of Ni(II) complexes, with the general formula Ni(NHC)[P(OR)3](Ar)Cl, are described. These air&#8208;stable complexes are effective under mild conditions and low catalytic loading for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling for a range of electronically and sterically differentiated coupling partners. This paper also highlights experimental and spectroscopic methods, alongside DFT calculations, to support an operating mechanism of these precatalysts. 








Abstract
The synthesis and catalytic properties of Ni(II) complexes with the general formula Ni(NHC)[P(OR)3](Ar)Cl are described. These complexes are air&#8208;stable and extremely effective precatalysts in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The reaction protocols described allow for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides and arylboronic acids, employing low catalytic loading, to deliver a large variety of functionalized biaryl compounds. For the coupling of aryl chlorides with N&#8208;heterocyclic boronic acids, TBAF was used as an additive to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing biaryl products. Overall, these reaction protocols operate at room or mild temperatures and can be applied to a variety of electronically and sterically differentiated coupling partners. Fundamental insights into the mechanism of this reaction, including the proposed formation of the catalytically active Ni(NHC)[P(Oi&#8208;Pr)3] and resting state species, are also reported.

         <title>Intermolecular Toroidal Conjugation: Circularly Stacked 16 &#960;&#8208;Planes Formed by Supramolecular Assembly Enabling Cyclic Charge and Energy Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence is provided for intermolecular toroidal conjugation in a cyclic &#960;&#8208;stacking array of 16 &#960;&#8208;planes formed through supramolecular assembly. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a circularly stacked arrangement of 16 dihydrodiazapentacene units around a stacked phthalocyanine pair. Spectroscopic studies, supported by theoretical calculations, indicated positive charge migration within the toroidal array in both cationic and photoexcited states.








Abstract
Toroidal conjugation is a unique mechanism for charge and exciton delocalization via through&#8208;space overlap among circularly stacked &#960;&#8208;orbitals, but the examples have been limited to intramolecular phenomena, where &#960;&#8208;planes are arranged around a hub molecule. In this study, we extend this concept to intermolecular phenomena and provide strong evidence for intermolecular toroidal conjugation in designed systems, in which a circular &#960;&#8208;stacked array is formed by molecular self&#8208;assembly. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis unequivocally revealed a toroidal array of 16 &#960;&#8208;planes formed by the supramolecular dimerization of phthalocyanines substituted with eight pillar&#8208;like diazapentacenes interdigitating their &#960;&#8208;pillars. The experimentally determined interplanar distances in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array were close enough to realize through&#8208;space conjugation. Various steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies, supported by theoretical calculations, indicated the possibility of positive charge migration within the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array in the cationic and photoexcited states.

         <title>Asymmetric Structural Design in Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks to Facilitate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric structural design strategy has been developed to construct covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composed of ternary units and dual linkages to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. By integrating the COF with cobaloxime complexes, the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular photocatalyst synergistically achieves spatially segregated redox sites and significantly enhances the photocatalytic overall water splitting efficiency.








Abstract
Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular hybrid composed of a cobaloxime complex and a covalent organic framework (COF) that achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting. The designed COF features ternary units and dual linkages, which induce asymmetric linkers. Upon photoexcitation, this asymmetry facilitates directed electron transfer and spatially separated redox sites, resulting in a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state. Consequently, the COF, hydrogen&#8208;bonded with cobaloxime as a hydrogen (H2) production cocatalyst, enables visible&#8208;light photocatalytic overall water splitting, simultaneously producing H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), outperforming the COFs with symmetric linker structures. This strategy of asymmetric structural design offers new insights for the design of photocatalysts with suppressed charge recombination for photocatalysis.

         <title>Vanillin&#8208;Derived Degradable and Reprocessable Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxy Resins with High Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three vanillin&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy resins with different aromatic imine structures were prepared. The epoxy resin containing the longest conjugated aromatic imine structures shows the highest intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.38&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). The dynamic chemical features of imine bonds endow the prepared epoxy resins with reprocessability and chemical degradability.








Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;functionality and miniaturized consumer electronics is driving the development of polymer packaging materials with intrinsically high thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel vanillin&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy monomer (BEP) and three curing agents (ICA&#8208;1, ICA&#8208;2, and ICA&#8208;3) containing conjugated aromatic imine structures were synthesized. The results of X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements show that the structural order of the epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs increases with the number of conjugated benzene rings in ICAs. Compared with the conventional epoxy reference (0.23&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), the prepared liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy resins exhibit enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.28&#8211;0.38&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) due to the synergistic effect from the liquid&#8208;crystalline phase structure in BEP and the additional ordered structure (via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) in ICAs. Both experimental and molecular dynamics calculation results show that the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resins is proportional to the length of the conjugated structures in ICAs. Owing to the incorporation of dynamic aromatic imine bonds, the three cured epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs demonstrate excellent reprocessibility through imine metathesis and are chemically degradable in the amine solution.

&lt;p&gt;Three vanillin-based liquid-crystalline epoxy resins with different aromatic imine structures were prepared. The epoxy resin containing the longest conjugated aromatic imine structures shows the highest intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.38&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The dynamic chemical features of imine bonds endow the prepared epoxy resins with reprocessability and chemical degradability.

         <title>Spiro Units Embedded in the B/N Center for Constructing Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically integrating spiro polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (spiro&#8208;PAHs) either in their entirety or partially into the boron/nitrogen&#8208; multiple resonances (B/N&#8208;MR) cores, it is feasible to develop highly efficient and narrow&#8208;band MR&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), while simultaneously tuning their emission wavelengths.








Abstract
Departing from conventional molecular design strategies that rely on spiro units merely as peripheral components (side chains, terminal groups, or linkage units), we fully or partially incorporate the rigid 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] (SF) unit into the boron/nitrogen multiple resonances (B/N&#8208;MR) emitting core, thereby successfully developing a series of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomerized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, namely SF&#8208;BN1, SF&#8208;BN2, SF&#8208;BN3, and SF&#8208;BN4. Remarkably, these novel emitters exhibit exceptionally narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 15&#8211;21&#160;nm in dilute toluene solutions and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 90% in doped films. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on SF&#8208;BN1 achieved high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 29.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.08), closely aligning with the BT.2020 blue emission standard. Sky&#8208;blue OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 can achieve a high EQE of 29.8%, with a narrow FWHM value of 18&#160;nm; the hyperfluorescent (HF) OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 improved the EQE of 35.5%. Moreover, we elucidated subtle variations in the connectivity of chemical functional groups within emitters and the polar environment and doping concentrations of OLEDs, which can significantly impact these isomers' optical and electroluminescent (EL) properties.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Optical Anisotropy with UV Transmission Achieved by Rational Arrangement of Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid birefringent material with large optical anisotropy has been prepared by employing the strategy of appropriately aligned extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups.








Abstract
Birefringent material serves as a cornerstone in photonic applications, including optical communications, polarization control, and laser technologies. The development of birefringent materials with large birefringence (&#916;n &gt;&#160;0.3) and short ultraviolet (UV) cut&#8208;off edge (&#955;cut&#8208;off edge &lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that properly aligned expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups provide a solution to balance the birefringence and UV transmittance. We report a new birefringent material, Li3(C9N13)&#183;6H2O (LCN), in which the Li atoms and water molecules act as linkers to connect the birefringence&#8208;active group [C9N13]. This crystal material exhibits a giant optical anisotropy (&#916;nexp&#160;=&#160;1.031 @ 546&#160;nm), which is one of the highest among bulk crystal materials known to date. In addition, LCN shows a band gap of 3.62&#160;eV, indicating its applicability in the UV optical range. Owing to favorable Li cation linkers and hydrogen bonding, the [C9N13] groups achieve a perfectly coplanar arrangement, thereby maximizing the optical anisotropy. This work offers a novel strategy for the rational design of advanced birefringent materials.

         <title>Selective Recognition and Extraction of Short&#8208;Chain Perfluoroalkyl Carboxylates by a Supramolecular Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic receptor for the complexation of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates was developed. The receptor can be used for the selective extraction of short&#8208;chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates from water into an organic solvent. 








Abstract
A supramolecular receptor for short&#8208;chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates was developed. The receptor displays a cage&#8208;like geometry, with a defined binding site for the carboxylate head groups and an opening for the perfluoroalkyl side chains. The anionic guests are bound via multiple CH&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds, as revealed by the crystallographic analysis of an adduct between the receptor and trifluoroacetate. The receptor can be used for the selective extraction of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates from buffered aqueous solutions containing fluoride, chloride, nitrate, carbonate, acetate, and phosphate.

         <title>Built&#8208;In Electric Field in Freestanding Hydroxide/Sulfide Heterostructures for Industrially Relevant Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freestanding NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure supported on nickel mesh was synthesized for industrially relevant alkaline water electrolysis. The robust built&#8208;in electric field and the asymmetric electron distribution at the interface play pivotal roles in significantly enhancing the activity and stability, including outstanding steady&#8208;state stability and resilience to operational fluctuations. 








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), as a premier technology to massively produce green hydrogen, hinges on outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes with high activity and robust stability under high current densities. However, it is often challenged by issues such as catalytic layer shedding, ion dissolution, and inefficient bubble desorption. Herein, a scalable corrosion&#8208;electrodeposition method is presented to synthesize nickel&#8211;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH)/Ni3S2 heterostructures on nickel mesh, tailored to meet the stringent requirements of industrial AWE. The study underscores the critical role of the built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) in optimizing electronic properties, curtailing Fe leaching, and enhancing mass transfer. The resultant NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure manifests remarkable OER performance, with ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 202&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 290&#160;mV at 800&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH at 25&#160;&#176;C, alongside superior steady&#8208;state stability and resistance to reverse current under fluctuating conditions. Furthermore, the performance is further validated in an alkaline electrolyzer, achieving a large current density of 800&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.908&#160;V, while maintaining excellent stability. This work offers a blueprint for the design of efficient OER electrodes for industrially relevant AWE applications.

&lt;p&gt;Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), as a premier technology to massively produce green hydrogen, hinges on outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes with high activity and robust stability under high current densities. However, it is often challenged by issues such as catalytic layer shedding, ion dissolution, and inefficient bubble desorption. Herein, a scalable corrosion-electrodeposition method is presented to synthesize nickel&#8211;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH)/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures on nickel mesh, tailored to meet the stringent requirements of industrial AWE. The study underscores the critical role of the built-in electric field (BEF) in optimizing electronic properties, curtailing Fe leaching, and enhancing mass transfer. The resultant NiFe-LDH/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure manifests remarkable OER performance, with ultra-low overpotentials of 202&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 290&#160;mV at 800&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1.0&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&#160;KOH at 25&#160;&#176;C, alongside superior steady-state stability and resistance to reverse current under fluctuating conditions. Furthermore, the performance is further validated in an alkaline electrolyzer, achieving a large current density of 800&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage of 1.908&#160;V, while maintaining excellent stability. This work offers a blueprint for the design of efficient OER electrodes for industrially relevant AWE applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Local&#8208;Ion Trap in Phase&#8208;Reversed Mixed Matrix COF Membranes for Ultrahigh Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the unprecedented local&#8208;ion trap was constructed by the development of a type of phase&#8208;reversed mixed matrix COF (PRCOF) membrane. Fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironments of local&#8208;ion trap affords moderate binding force, additional repulsion force, and assisted dehydration toward Li+, rendering the ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of PRCOF membranes in binary mixture. 








Abstract
Artificial molecular/ion traps afford grand potential in membrane&#8208;based separation processes. However, the existing trap&#8208;based architectures often confer over&#8208;strong binding forces, which severely impede the release of bound solutes during their transmembrane diffusion processes. Herein, we propose an unprecedented local&#8208;ion trap bearing moderate binding force and additional repulsion force in a type of phase&#8208;reversed mixed matrix covalent organic framework (PRCOF) membrane. By implementing COF as a continuous phase and polymer as a dispersed phase at the molecular level, the local&#8208;ion trap is formed in the COF channels equipped with free amino groups from polyethyleneimine (PEI). This unique local&#8208;ion trap built by electronegative COF nano&#8208;domains and electropositive PEI nano&#8208;domains offers appropriate interaction toward Li+, which allows the precise recognition and rapid transport of Li+ in the membrane channels. By tuning the microenvironments of local&#8208;ion trap, the optimum PRCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits considerably high actual selectivity of 190 along with a rapid Li+ permeation rate of 0.262&#160;mol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 in dealing with a Li+/Mg2+ binary mixture. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into the design of high&#8208;performance membranes with appropriate chemical interactions.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linking Profiling of Molecular Glue Degrader&#8208;Induced E3 Ligase Interactome to Expand Target Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and robust cross&#8208;linking profiling strategy was introduced for unveiling the molecular glue degrader (MGD)&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactomes in live cells, integrating genetic code expansion with chemoproteomics. Neosubstrates of E3 ligase induced by both well&#8208;known and novel MG degraders were identified, expanding the target space for targeted protein degradation and opening new opportunities to address challenging undruggable proteins. 








Abstract
Molecular glue (MG) degraders, small molecules with significant therapeutic potential for targeting undruggable proteins, are emerging as new modality in drug discovery. Profiling the E3 ligase interactome induced by MG degraders provides insights into their mechanism of action and identifies clinically relevant neosubstrates for degradation, thereby offering new therapeutic opportunities. However, established methods face significant challenges in comprehensive and accurate profiling of MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome. Herein, we introduce the concept of globally cross&#8208;linking profiling of the MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome in living cells, achieved by integrating genetic code expansion technology with mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics. Our approach presents an efficient and robust strategy for identifying neosubstrates recruited to cereblon E3 ligase by the known degraders CC&#8208;885 and DKY709, offering valuable insights for clinical evaluation and significantly expanding their target space. Moreover, we developed two novel MG degraders with potent antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, and application of our method identified neosubstrates, revealing a previously unrecognized target landscape and advancing our understanding of E3 ligase&#8211;neosubstrate interactions. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool for neosubstrate identification and expanding target space of E3 ligase, opening new opportunities for developing next&#8208;generation MG degraders to address the clinical challenge of undruggable targets.

         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;noble Mn/Fe bimetallic catalyst system for hydrodearomative cycloaddition reaction of the poorly reactive but extensively distributed aza&#8208;arenes with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been developed. The manganese catalyst is involved in mild hydrodearomatization of the aza&#8208;arenes, while the Fe(OTf)2 as a Lewis acid activates both aza&#8208;arenes and BCBs. DFT calculations revealed that the Fe(II)&#8208;aza&#8208;arene coordination contributes to the 1,4&#8208;hydrogenation of the aza&#8208;arenes, which then generates imine via isomerization, and prevents the thermodynamically favorable N&#8208;heteroaryl overreduction. The developed chemistry offers a practical platform for direct access to functional 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in a step and atom&#8208;economic fashion.








Abstract
Converting planar six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;arenes into C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds is a promising way to obtain isosteric mimetics of numerous functional products, but it remains to date a formidable challenge due to the high thermodynamic stability and dynamic inertness as well as the selectivity control. Here, by applying a novel non&#8208;noble bimetallic Mn/Fe catalyst system, we report, for the first time, an approach for direct construction of functional 3D 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via a hydrodearomatization (HDA) of the aza&#8208;arenes and [2&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] cycloaddition cascade. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the triplet state of Fe(II) facilitates the activation of both aza&#8208;arenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). The mild reduction nature of manganese catalysis and the steric effects of Fe(II) coordination result in an 1,4&#8208;hydrodearomatization, and the imine species derived from the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;hydrogenated aza&#8208;arenes are then effectively trapped by the polarized BCBs, thus suppressing the thermodynamically favorable over&#8208;hydrogenation of aza&#8208;arenes into cyclic amine by&#8208;products. Given the features of good substrate and functionality compatibility, high step and atom efficiency, and diversified product post&#8208;transformations, the developed chemistry offers a practical platform to access various functional molecules.

         <title>Controlled Deformation Mode and Amplitude of Liquid Crystal Actuators Through Orthogonal Light and Heat&#8208;Induced Exchanges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a structural design that enables independent control over both the mode and amplitude of deformation in liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). This design incorporates photo&#8208;reactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure, allowing for customizable, continuous, and precise deformations. This breakthrough is essential for bridging the gap between LCEs and biological motion systems.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are versatile soft actuators known for their flexible texture, low density, and ability to undergo reversible deformations that mimic the behavior of skeletal muscles. These properties make them highly attractive for applications in exoskeletons, soft robotics, and medical devices. However, their functionality is typically limited to simple and discontinuous deformations. This study introduces a novel structural design that enables precise control of both the mode and amplitude of deformation. This design integrates photo&#8208;reactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure. The o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties enable irreversible reconfiguration of the LCE crosslinked network through photoreactions, allowing for easy alignment and reshaping of the material. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds act as &#8220;temperature&#8208;dependent locks&#8221;, regulating the mobility of polymer chains during thermal deformation.

     alt="Controlled Deformation Mode and Amplitude of Liquid Crystal Actuators Through Orthogonal Light and Heat-Induced Exchanges"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce a structural design that enables independent control over both the mode and amplitude of deformation in liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). This design incorporates photo-reactive o-nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature-dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure, allowing for customizable, continuous, and precise deformations. This breakthrough is essential for bridging the gap between LCEs and biological motion systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are versatile soft actuators known for their flexible texture, low density, and ability to undergo reversible deformations that mimic the behavior of skeletal muscles. These properties make them highly attractive for applications in exoskeletons, soft robotics, and medical devices. However, their functionality is typically limited to simple and discontinuous deformations. This study introduces a novel structural design that enables precise control of both the mode and amplitude of deformation. This design integrates photo-reactive &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature-dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure. The &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl moieties enable irreversible reconfiguration of the LCE crosslinked network through photoreactions, allowing for easy alignment and reshaping of the material. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds act as &#8220;temperature-dependent locks&#8221;, regulating the mobility of polymer chains during thermal deformation. By adjusting the heating temperature, the deformation amplitude can be finely tuned across a wide range (0%&#8211;103%). The synergy of these two mechanisms&#8212;light-induced irreversible reconfiguration and temperature-induced reversible H-bond exchanges&#8212;empowers LCEs to achieve customizable and continuous deformations. This represents a significant advancement in bridging the gap between synthetic actuators and biological motion systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascaded Metalation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Electrochemical CO Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded metalation in a 2D covalent organic framework (COF) shifts the overall d&#8208;band center upwards and enhances CO adsorption. The secondary metal sites facilitate the hydrogenation of CO. Consequently, the barriers associated with the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) are significantly lower, leading to substantial improvements in the CO reduction reaction with a 23&#8208;fold enhancement in the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of methanol production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) to high&#8208;value methanol requires the delicate design of catalysts due to the large overpotential. Especially, achieving precise modification of electrocatalysts while preserving the periodic alignment of active sites to optimize performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the cascaded metalation of phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs for selective reduction of CO to methanol. After implanting the secondary metal (Ni), CityU&#8208;35 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.4% at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, significantly surpassing that of CityU&#8208;34 (2.1%) with only Co atoms. Enhanced methanol production originates from the optimization of electronic structure with improved *CO adsorption, as substantiated by the in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the cascaded metalation with the introduction of secondary Ni sites not only strengthens *CO adsorption but also accelerates proton generation for the hydrogenation of *CO toward CH3OH. The cascaded metalation with synergistic effects between Co and Ni sites reduces the energy barriers and improves the overall electroactivity. Our results demonstrate cascaded metalation as an effective strategy to tailor the catalytic activities of 2D&#160;COFs, extending the functional design of reticular frameworks in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Trifunctionalization of Iodoarenes via Sequence&#8208;Controlled Double Ortho C&#9472;H Acylations by Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd(0)/NBE&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization reaction has been successfully developed for the selective assembly of contiguously substituted aromatic compounds from ortho&#8208;unsubstituted iodoarenes and alkyl/aryl mixed anhydrides combined with a carboxylate anion activator. This domino reaction was realized through sequence&#8208;controlled ortho C&#9472;H alkyl&#8208;acylation, ortho' C&#9472;H aryl&#8208;acylation, and ipso&#8208;termination with an alkenyl or aryl nucleophile.








Abstract
Herein we report a novel palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization reaction of ortho&#8208;unsubstituted iodoarenes by incorporating two distinct acyl groups at their ortho C&#9472;H positions and replacing the ipso&#8208;iodide with an alkenyl or aryl group. Notably, this transformation was enabled by the alkyl/aryl mixed anhydrides, which were utilized as dual acylation reagents by abstracting their central oxygen atom with electrophilic 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the alkyl&#8208;acyl unit of such an anhydride was employed for the first C&#9472;H alkyl&#8208;acylation, and in situ released aryl carboxylate anion was then rapidly activated with triazine chloride to provide an aryl&#8211;acyl electrophile for the second C&#9472;H acylation, thus enabling the trifunctionalization of iodoarenes by termination with an intermolecular Heck or intramolecular arylation reaction. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the selective manipulation of carbonyl groups of the products.

         <dc:description>
The discovery of high ion&#8208;conductive inorganic crystal structures remains a challenge in facilitating the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Ionic conductors reported to date have predominantly been limited to well&#8208;known crystal structures. In this work, we report a new, unprecedented crystalline structure, Li21Ge8P3S34, which demonstrates high ionic conductivity.








Abstract
Lithium superionic conductors are pivotal for enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which aim to replace liquid electrolytes and enhance safety. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented lithium superionic conductor, Li21Ge8P3S34, featuring a novel structural type and a new composition in the Li&#8211;Ge&#8211;P&#8211;S system. This material exhibits high lithium ionic conductivity of approximately 1.0&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 303&#160;K with a low activation energy of 0.20(1)&#160;eV. It's unique crystal structure was elucidated using three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) and further refined through combined powder X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction analyses. The structure consists of alternating two&#8208;dimensional slabs: one of corner&#8208;sharing GeS4 tetrahedra and the other of isolated PS4 tetrahedra, enabling efficient lithium&#8208;ion transport through a tetrahedrally interconnected network of 1D, 2D, and 3D diffusion pathways. This distinctive structural motif provides a novel design strategy for next&#8208;generation solid electrolytes, broadening the structural landscape of lithium superionic conductors. With further advancements in compositional tuning and interfacial engineering, Li21Ge8P3S34 could contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Self&#8208;Sustaining Modular Afterglow Scaffold for In Vivo Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative (i.e., BDI) is molecularly tailored with iodine substitution for 1O2 generation and prolonged ethylene bonds to increase 1O2 reactivity, enabling a self&#8208;sustaining afterglow initiator, substrate, and relay unit simultaneously. By introducing a biomarker&#8208;responsive unit on the N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline group, activatable afterglow probes can be fabricated for sensitive and precise imaging of biomarker&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs) offer high simplicity, reproducibility, and design flexibility compared to common multicomponent systems. To date, only a few SAMs have been reported. However, these studies mainly focus on probe selection and screening, without providing the guidance for constructing SAMs from the bottom up. Herein, we report the molecular design and tuning of a boron dipyrromethene derivative (BDI), with structural engineering to enhance the singlet oxygen (1O2) reactivity and photosensitivity, aiming to construct SAMs for activatable afterglow imaging. The optimized BDI is customized into water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles (i.e., BDI&#8208;NPs) aided by an amphiphilic polymer, achieving all&#8208;in&#8208;one afterglow luminescence with a peak at 780&#160;nm. An activatable afterglow probe (i.e., BDIS&#8208;NPs) is fabricated, which can simultaneously activate fluorescence and afterglow signals in the presence of hydrogen disulfide (H2S). Owing to the elimination of autofluorescence and high activation contrast of the afterglow signal, BDIS&#8208;NPs enables early monitoring of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced acute lung injury within 15&#160;min and sensitive visualization of H2S accumulation in the brain of schizophrenia mice with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), which is not achievable by fluorescence imaging. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding and design guidelines for SAMs and activatable afterglow imaging.

&lt;p&gt;A boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative (i.e., BDI) is molecularly tailored with iodine substitution for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation and prolonged ethylene bonds to increase &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactivity, enabling a self-sustaining afterglow initiator, substrate, and relay unit simultaneously. By introducing a biomarker-responsive unit on the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylaniline group, activatable afterglow probes can be fabricated for sensitive and precise imaging of biomarker-related diseases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs) offer high simplicity, reproducibility, and design flexibility compared to common multicomponent systems. To date, only a few SAMs have been reported. However, these studies mainly focus on probe selection and screening, without providing the guidance for constructing SAMs from the bottom up. Herein, we report the molecular design and tuning of a boron dipyrromethene derivative (BDI), with structural engineering to enhance the singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reactivity and photosensitivity, aiming to construct SAMs for activatable afterglow imaging. The optimized BDI is customized into water-soluble nanoparticles (i.e., BDI-NPs) aided by an amphiphilic polymer, achieving all-in-one afterglow luminescence with a peak at 780&#160;nm. An activatable afterglow probe (i.e., BDIS-NPs) is fabricated, which can simultaneously activate fluorescence and afterglow signals in the presence of hydrogen disulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Owing to the elimination of autofluorescence and high activation contrast of the afterglow signal, BDIS-NPs enables early monitoring of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury within 15&#160;min and sensitive visualization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S accumulation in the brain of schizophrenia mice with a high signal-to-background ratio (SBR), which is not achievable by fluorescence imaging. This study provides an in-depth understanding and design guidelines for SAMs and activatable afterglow imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semiconductor Spacer with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure Drives 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells Beyond 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong orbital interactions were observed for RP perovskites based on newly developed semiconductor spacers, MeBThMA and CNBThMA. The unique D&#8208;A structure of CNBThMA spacer effectively eliminates the dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers, contributing to the formation of energy levels, and adjusting the anisotropic charge transport properties. As a result, the CNBThMA&#8208;Pb (n&#160;=&#160;5) device achieved a champion efficiency of 20.82%.








Abstract
Two dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials. However, their further improvement in photovoltaic efficiency is hindered by the large dielectric mismatch and high exciton binding energy caused by the insulating spacers. Herein, two semiconductor spacers, namely MeBThMA and CNBThMA, were developed for 2D RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In contrast to MeBThMA, the CNBThMA spacer, which features a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, exhibits a larger dipole moment and adopts a face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking arrangement in the single crystal. The unique D&#8208;A structure effectively eliminates the dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers, contributing the formation of energy levels, adjusting the anisotropic charge transport properties, and improving the film quality of layered RP perovskites. Consequently, the devices based on CNBThMA (nominal n&#160;=&#160;5) achieved a champion efficiency of 20.82%, which is a record efficiency for 2D RP PSCs using semiconductor spacers to the best of our knowledge. Our work pioneers a novel way to design organic semiconductor spacers using a D&#8208;A structure for highly efficient 2D PSCs.

         <title>Atroposelective Construction of C&#9472;B Axial Chirality via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective construction of C&#9472;B axial chirality has been developed through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution. The chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst differentiates between rapidly equilibrating atropoisomeric 1,2&#8208;azaborine&#8208;based arylaldehyde. DFT studies suggest that the formation of the Breslow intermediate via [Cs]HCO3&#8208;assisted [1,2]&#8208;proton transfer is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
C&#9472;B axially chiral architectures are valuable in materials science and medicinal chemistry, but their enantioselective synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient method for the enantioselective synthesis of C&#9472;B axially chiral 1,2&#8208;azaborines through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution. The treatment of racemic 1,2&#8208;azaborine&#8208;based arylaldehyde with a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst under oxidative conditions in the presence of an alcohol leads to atroposelective esterification with up to 97% yield and 98% ee. The practicality of this method has been demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic studies indicate that the chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst differentiates between rapidly equilibrating atropoisomeric 1,2&#8208;azaborine&#8208;based arylaldehyde. DFT studies suggest that the formation of the Breslow intermediate via [Cs]HCO3&#8208;assisted [1,2]&#8208;proton transfer is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Benzamide&#8208;Directed Hydroarylative Cross&#8208;Couplings Using Minimally Activated Alkenes: Enantioselective Synthesis of Tertiary and Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzamide&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed branched selective and enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;H additions to minimally activated alkenes give tertiary and quaternary benzylic stereocenters under byproduct&#8208;free conditions. The processes are enabled by a family of SPINOL&#8208;based homochiral diphosphonite ligands.








Abstract
Ir&#8208;systems modified with ferrocene&#8208;based homochiral diphosphonite ligands, prepared from functionalized SPINOL derivatives, promote benzamide&#8208;directed hydroarylative cross&#8208;couplings involving minimally activated alkenes. The processes are highly branched selective and enantioselective. Accordingly, tertiary benzylic stereocenters are generated under byproduct&#8208;free conditions. This contrast with conventional cross&#8208;coupling approaches, which are less step and atom economical. Preliminary results show that the process extends to the formation of quaternary benzylic stereocenters.

         <title>Engineered Probiotics Enable Targeted Gut Delivery of Dual Gasotransmitters for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We engineer Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with CO/H2S&#8208;releasing copolymers, enabling targeted and controlled CO/H2S release at inflamed sites. This strategy alleviates IBD by reducing inflammation, restoring gut barrier integrity, and promoting beneficial microbiota. Additionally, CO/H2S enhances neuroprotective metabolites, reducing neuroinflammation and anxiety&#8208;like behaviors, offering a novel therapeutic avenue.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains an incurable condition, often accompanied by high rates of anxiety and depression, further diminishing the quality of life of patients. Endogenous gasotransmitters, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S), exhibit potent anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, their therapeutic application is limited by challenges in targeted delivery to affected tissues. Here, we propose a novel strategy for targeted gut delivery of CO/H2S through engineering Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with CO/H2S&#8208;releasing copolymer (POSR) loading. This engineered probiotic (POSR@EcN) enhances EcN colonization in the intestine and enables controlled, localized release of CO/H2S at inflamed sites. The release of CO/H2S modulates inflammation, restores intestinal barrier integrity, and reshapes gut microbiota by promoting beneficial bacteria and increasing short&#8208;chain fatty acids production, effectively alleviating IBD symptoms. Notably, targeted CO/H2S delivery also elevates neuroprotective metabolites like indoleacetic acid and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid, reducing neuroinflammation via the gut&#8208;brain axis and mitigating anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors in IBD mice. This approach highlights the potential of EcN as a probiotic carrier for the targeted delivery of gasotransmitters, offering a promising strategy for IBD treatment.

         <title>Balancing Intermediates Formation on Atomically Pd&#8208;Bridged Cu/Cu2O Interfaces for Kinetics&#8208;Matching Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O catalyst with atomically Pd&#8208;bridged Cu/Cu2O interfaces was designed for efficient electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling reaction. The active Cu&#8211;Pd dual sites effectively balance the formation of C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediates and significantly lower the energy barrier for C&#9472;N coupling, thereby enhancing the synthesis of urea.








Abstract
The electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling of CO2 and nitrogenous species provides a promising approach for synthesizing valuable chemicals such as urea, amides, and other C&#9472;N compounds. However, the unbalanced formation of C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediates results in slow C&#9472;N coupling kinetics. Herein, we report an atomically Pd&#8208;bridged Cu/Cu2O (Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O) catalyst, synthesized through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Pd1&#8211;Cu2Te nanosheets. This catalyst features Pd&#8211;Cu dual sites that significantly enhance C&#9472;N coupling both thermodynamically and kinetically. The reconstructed Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O achieves a urea yield rate of 31.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 42.2%, along with excellent stability over 100&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic examinations and theoretical calculations disclose that the Pd&#8211;Cu dual sites on Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O modulate the reduction kinetics of CO2 and NO3&#8722;, balance the formation of crucial *CO and *NH2 intermediates, and lower the energy barrier for C&#9472;N coupling, thereby facilitating urea synthesis. Furthermore, the Pd1&#8211;Cu/Cu2O enables the unprecedented C&#9472;N coupling of aniline with CO, resulting in a remarkable acetanilide yield rate of 1021.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 with an FE of 23.7%. This heteroatom bridging strategy offers a new pathway for designing efficient electrocatalyst for the synthesis of C&#9472;N coupled compounds.

         <title>Rapid Water Permeation by Aramid Foldamer Nanochannels With Hydrophobic Interiors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We compare the water permeability of stacked macrocycles and synthetic helical nanotubes of three different lengths across phospholipid bilayers. Our results demonstrate that covalent nanotubes with a length matching the bilayer width exhibit high water permeability, excellent salt and proton rejection, and performance comparable to natural aquaporins.








Abstract
Aquaporins are natural proteins that rapidly transport water across cell membranes, maintaining homeostasis, whilst strictly excluding salt. This has inspired their use in water purification and desalination, a critical emerging need. However, stability, scalability, and cost have prevented their widespread adoption in water purification membrane technologies. As such, attention has turned to the use of artificial water channels, with pore&#8208;functionalized polymers and macrocycles providing a powerful alternative. Whilst impressive rates of transport have been achieved, the combination of a scalable, high&#8208;yielding synthesis and efficient transport has not yet been reported. Herein, we report such a system, with densely functionalized channel interiors, synthesized by high&#8208;yielding living polymerization with low polydispersities, showing high salt exclusion and excellent water transport rates. Our aramid foldamers create artificial water channels with hydrophobic interiors and single&#8208;channel water permeability rates of up to 108 water molecules per second per channel, approaching the range of natural aquaporins (c. 109). We show that water transport rates closely correspond to the helical length, with the polymer that most closely matches bilayer thickness showing optimal efficacy, as supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our work provides a basis for the scalable synthesis of next&#8208;generation artificial water channels.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Amines and Alcohols via Ynamide Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines and alcohols has been realized using ynamides as coupling reagents, enabling the straightforward construction of axially chiral amides and planar&#8208;chiral esters. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage modification of medicinally relevant molecules, scale&#8208;up reactions, downstream transformations, chiral ligand, and catalyst synthesis, and further applications in asymmetric catalysis.








Abstract
Carboxylic acids are readily available chemicals with broad applications in chemistry&#8208;related areas, and their coupling with amines and alcohols is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. However, the catalytic enantioselective coupling of carboxylic acids remains elusive, especially for the atroposelective reaction. Here we report a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines and alcohols using ynamides as coupling reagents. The novel enantiocontrol involving CBA&#8208;catalyzed ester addition enables the straightforward construction of axially chiral amides and planar&#8208;chiral esters with high enantioselectivities through atroposelective intermolecular amidation and intramolecular macrolactonization. Diverse medicinally relevant carboxylic acids can undergo direct late&#8208;stage modification by this method. Importantly, this reaction represents the first atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines, as well as the first chemocatalytic atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols. The resulting atropisomeric skeletons can be readily derivatized to chiral ligands and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Unraveling the Cause of Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Formation: Disparities in Metal Nanoparticle Anchoring Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 22, May 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atoms strongly prefer to anchor to oxygen vacancies (Ov) rather than hydroxyl sites on the anatase TiO2 support. Instead, Pd atoms lack this preference for Ov and occupy more hydroxyl sites. Ultimately, the high concentration of residual Ov on the support causes Pd NPs to be in a more severe encapsulation state in the high&#8208;temperature hydrogen environment.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) can be normally induced by the surface free energy differences between metal nanoparticles and supports. To gain deeper insights into the effect of SMSI on heterogeneous catalysis, we use prototype Pt, Pd/TiO2(anatase) systems to demonstrate different reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction activity changes, especially with increasing the metal nanoparticle (NP) loading. Our experiments show that the conventional surface&#8208;free&#8208;energy change law regarding the incremental NP size is no longer applicable to these systems due to the overlook of the change of support properties owing to the disparities of the metal anchoring mechanisms. Both experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Pt atoms strongly favor anchoring on the oxygen vacancies (Ov) over the OH&#8208;sites on the anatase TiO2 support. In contrast, Pd atoms lack such Ov&#8208;site preference compared to Pt atoms, thereby leaving higher content of Ov on the support than the Pt counterpart. Moreover, high density of residual Ov on the support can cause the Pd NPs to be in higher degree of contact with the support, either in NP&#8208;encapsulation state (experiment) or NP&#8208;spreading state (simulation). The enhanced CO2 conversion of Pt/TiO2A is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ov and hydrogen spillover from Pt sites.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;X and C&#8722;H Borylation of Aryl Halides for the Synthesis of Bis(boronate)benzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the intensive studies on the synthesis and application of aryl boronates, most focus on mono borylated arenes. The multi borylated arenes, on the other hand, have received much less attention because the preparation of multi borylated arenes in a straightforward manner is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present our findings on synthesizing bis borylated arenes from structure&#8208;diverse and readily available aryl halides (Ar&#8211;X, X = Cl, Br, I). Simultaneous C&#8722;X and C&#8722;H borylation of aryl halides is achieved using earth&#8208;abundant titanium as a catalyst. Not only the 1,2&#8208;bis borylation but the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;bis borylation are also achieved. Control experiment and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computation propose an titanium&#8208;mediated aryl radical&#8208;driven reaction resulting selective bis&#8208;borylation over mono&#8208;borylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Visualizing Electrochemical Triple&#8208;Phase Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) is a complex interface where gas, liquid, and solid phases converge, crucially regulating the efficiency and performance of many electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and batteries. However, conventional characterization techniques struggle to capture the dynamic processes and flooding at TPB. To address this, we develop operando electrochemical magnetic resonance imaging (EC&#8208;MRI), an inherently non&#8208;invasive technique sensitive to 1H, which probes both bulk and boundary regions, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of TPB evolution and a deeper understanding of its function at the device level under operational conditions. In a study of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), with a focus on the kinetically sluggish O2 reduction reaction in&#160;cathode, operando EC&#8208;MRI quantitatively illustrates the interplay between power output, water content, and TPB evolution. It reveals that the TPB maps undergo significant spatial and dynamic variations, with TPB deterioration, rather than apparent water accumulation, directly triggering flooding, as proved using catalysts with different water generation and adsorption capabilities. Our finding opens new perspectives on water management and TPB design, with potential applications in other critical electrochemical processes such as H2 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and N2 reduction, underscoring the value of operando EC&#8208;MRI for real&#8208;time diagnostics of electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Conjugated Sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Accelerated Exciton Process for Superior Singlet Oxygen Photosynthesis for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen (O2) activation via energy transfer offers a sustainable approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis, while its performance suffers from the ultrafast exciton dissociation and sluggish intersystem crossing (ISC) process. Up to date, exciton regulation is still in its infancy. Here, via linkage engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we propose a fully conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs) with strong exciton interaction and fast ISC for boosted 1O2 photosynthesis. The sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs delivers a record&#8208;high 1O2 yield (624 &#956;M min&#8211;1) with 100% selectivity, which is ca. 8 times that of the traditional imine&#8208;bridged COFs (Im&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs, ca. 95.8% selectivity), outperforming documented systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the fully conjugated sp2 carbon linkage of sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs can enhance Coulomb interaction, promote ISC and push forward the transfer of triplet exciton to the O2 adsorption sites throughout the COFs matrix, jointly facilitating the energy transfer process for efficient 1O2 photosynthesis and bypassing the traditional electron transfer process. Hence, sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs can selectively degrade acetaminophen within minutes under visible light irradiation and enables stable degradation of emerging pollutants in a continuous flow membrane reactor (20 &#215; 30 &#215; 2 cm) utilizing natural sunlight and dissolved O2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral subcomponent self&#8208;assembly is used to access optically pure, metallo&#8208;helical species based on Zn and Fe(II) and incorporating three trans&#8208;azobenzene units.

         <title>Self&#8208;Activated Heterogeneous Fenton Process for Accelerated Degradation of Aromatic Pollutants over Copper Oxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement of CuO for H2O2 activation and self&#8208;accelerated pollutant degradation, contrasting the performance decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. CuO can stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals to further mediate the H2O2 activation and meanwhile yielding low&#8208;valent Cu. This offers opportunities for simultaneously addressing the catalyst passivation and redox cycling limitations of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton&#8208;like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer route, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low&#8208;valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe&#8208;Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst&#8208;phenol interaction towards self&#8208;activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14&#8208;time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100&#8208;day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst&#8208;pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer via Cerium Photocatalysis for Alkoxy Radical&#8208;Mediated Selective Hydroetherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct coupling of free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes&#8212;a longstanding challenge due to inherent polarity mismatches&#8212;is achieved via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform featuring cerium(IV) benzoate catalysts. This anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroetherification proceeds through selective activation of free alcohols into alkoxy radicals, facilitated by LMCT homolysis, even in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as enol ethers. Mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate complex, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation.








Abstract
We present a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform utilizing cerium(IV) benzoate complexes to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of directly coupling free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes, overcoming inherent polarity mismatches.

&lt;p&gt;Direct coupling of free alcohols with electron-rich alkenes&#8212;a longstanding challenge due to inherent polarity mismatches&#8212;is achieved via a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)-enabled catalytic platform featuring cerium(IV) benzoate catalysts. This anti-Markovnikov hydroetherification proceeds through selective activation of free alcohols into alkoxy radicals, facilitated by LMCT homolysis, even in the presence of redox-labile electron-rich alkenes such as enol ethers. Mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate complex, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation.

         <title>Designing Low&#8208;Cost High&#8208;Conductivity and Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolytes Toward High&#8208;Energy Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Evaluating the synergetic effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on the interaction between Na+ and anion balances stable interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes. Developed electrolytes enable high&#8208;energy pouch cell achieving a capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at the current density of 2C.








Abstract
Safety hazard induced by flammable electrolytes are troubling the advancement of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes are competent to address this issue, yet current designs struggle to balance the interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity due to the untamed interaction between Na+ and anion. Herein, we evaluate the effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on this interaction, revealing a systematic approach to achieve desired designs. It is shown that incorporating solvents with high DC and moderate Ea forms anion&#8208;rich solvation structure for stabilizing the anode interface and achieving necessary salt dissociation for high ionic conductivity. Specifically, propylene carbonate is incorporated as the eligible solvent into triethyl phosphate, affording non&#8208;flammable electrolytes with low cost and high ionic conductivity of 6.22&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Consequently, 1.25&#160;Ah hard carbon (HC)|NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) pouch cell delivers a high&#8208;power discharge of 5C rate and maintains an impressive capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, 6.61&#160;Ah HC|NFM pouch cell with 152.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 avoids smoke production and volume expansion during nail penetration. This work discloses an advanced strategy for deigning practical phosphate electrolytes, paving the way for developing high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen Bonding Tuned Enantioselectivity Control in Cobaloxime&#8208;Chiral Amine Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the enamine radical cation and cobaloxime controls the enantioselectivity. 








Abstract
Cobaloxime is a versatile 3d&#8208;metal catalyst for dehydrogenative radical coupling reactions. Prior mechanistic studies of cobaloxime catalysis have revealed that cobaloxime(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process can control the site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity of radical transformation. However, the relevance of HAT to the enantioselectivity is seldom reported. Herein, our density functional theory studies of the cobaloxime&#8208;chiral amine co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling of the enamine radical cation with alkene proved that it is the HAT step that determines the enantioselectivity, instead of the previously proposed radical addition. Because the metal&#8211;alkene&#8208;coupled (MAC) radical addition is a reversible process while the followed by HAT is the rate&#8208;determining step. Moreover, computational studies suggest that the dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the radical cation and cobaloxime plays a significant role in harnessing the reactivity and tuning the enantiocontrol. The intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen bonding between the iminium and the cobaloxime fragments contributes to the lower energy barrier of MAC radical addition. Structural analysis and quantitative steric&#8208;electronic effect dissection jointly unveiled that the stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the aminium and the cobaloxime fragments is the dominant factor that stabilizes the (R)&#8208;HAT transition state and guarantees high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Modulating the Polarity of Imine Bonds in Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the polarity of imine (C&#9552;N) bonds in donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with fluorinated units balances exciton binding and charge separation. A moderate C&#9552;N polarity delivers optimal H&#8322; evolution (14.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; g&#8315;&#185;), offering insights into polarity&#8211;performance relationships in COF photocatalysts.








Abstract
The development of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has also drawn attention to the influence of the nature of imine binding, including its orientation and possible protonation, on the chemical and physical properties of imine COFs. However, the influence of the polarity of imine bond (C&#9552;N) on the photocatalytic performance of COFs has not yet been described. In this work, we synthesized a series of imine COFs with differently polarized C&#9552;N bonds by altering the C&#9552;N bond orientation and regulating the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) strength, respectively. The less polarized C&#9552;N bond for one of the COFs possesses a faster charge separation with a decrease of exciton binding energy (Eb). In contrast, the imine COF with more polarized C&#9552;N bond exhibits a stronger internal electric field contributing to a more efficient charge transfer. Taking into account this trade&#8208;off between binding energy and charge transfer concerning the effect of C&#9552;N polarity on the photocatalytic performances, the imine COF with moderately polarized C&#9552;N bond shows the highest hydrogen evolution performance of 14.0&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides evidence that the polarity of C&#9552;N should be taken into account when designing and tuning the properties of imine COFs.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Psiguadial A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach harnessing reactive species enabled the enantioselective synthesis of the complex meroterpenoid psiguadial A through an enolate&#8211;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (oQM) umpolung strategy and late&#8208;stage cationic ring closure. The final fully decorated aromatic core was successfully synthesized by adaptation of modern aryl methyl ether deprotection and formylation methodologies, establishing efficient access to this class of natural products.








Abstract
The first enantioselective total synthesis of the antiproliferative natural product (&#8211;)&#8208;psiguadial A is reported. This approach features the enantioselective synthesis of a complex tricyclic terpenoid precursor, the union of that precursor with a polyketide component by an enolate&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide coupling reaction to form a highly congested carbon&#9472;carbon bond, and an acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular hydration ring&#8208;closure leveraging a fully substituted alkene to generate the unique oxepane core structure of the natural product.

         <title>Utilizing the Mn(II) Dissolution&#8208;Induced Vacancy for Optimum Mg2+ Storage of Spinel Mn3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are two significant factors necessary for the cathode materials of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion energy storage devices as follows: one is the storage mechanism of Mg2+ that can achieve enhanced Mg2+ diffusion kinetics and bring higher power density; the other is the high structural stability to achieve long lifespan. The tetrahedral vacancy reversible insertion/extraction mechanism by Mn(II) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg2+ energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan. 








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based oxide can theoretically exert the multivalent advantages of an aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion cathode due to its redox activity and abundant crystal structure. However, sluggish diffusion kinetics of Mg2+ and Mn dissolution limit the rate performance and structure stability. Herein, we successfully utilize the notorious dissolution of Mn(II) tetrahedral site contributed vacancies for packaging optimum Mg2+ storage of a popular spinel Mn3O4 electrode. Such mechanism reverses the sluggish diffusion kinetics. Moreover, merited by the common ion effect and drug dissolution, a suitable preaddition of Mn2+ to electrolyte inhibit Mn(III) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework. Impressively, the cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 and a stable cycle performance of 2000 cycles with 94.9% retention. Our research shows that reversible insertion/extraction at vacancies and effective stabilization of spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg2+ ion energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan.

         <title>Adaptive Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Clusters: Consistent Redox Behavior Versus Reversible Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters containing structurally analogous or differentiated cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in distinct oxidation states have been synthesized, which prove to be chemically interconvertible. The analysis of the strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained from the solution of these clusters indicates that they are electrochemically interconvertible through either reversible or irreversible pathways. This work provides a reference on how Fe&#8208;S/Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters mediate the electron transfer processes through redox&#8208;adaptive structural transformations.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are critical in a number of important biological processes, where their structural integrity can be maintained or reversibly transformed. However, it remains ambiguous how Fe&#8208;S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox&#8208;induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent&#8208;ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride&#8208;free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride&#8208;free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe&#8208;S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.

         <title>Vanadia Nanozymes Inhibit Platelet Aggregation, Modulate Signaling Pathways and Prevent Pulmonary Embolism in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activation and subsequent aggregation of platelets lead to the formation of thrombus, a key process in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we show that V2O5 nanozymes with GPx activity effectively inhibit the aggregation of human platelets and prevent pulmonary thromboembolism in mice. The nanozymes do not cause any undesired side effect of bleeding, which is important in the development of more effective and safe antithrombotic agents.








Abstract
Thrombosis is a pathological condition which represents the formation of clots inside blood vessels, blocking the flow of blood through the circulatory system. A high occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, has been observed in COVID&#8208;19 patients. Platelets (thrombocytes), the small cell fragments in the blood, play crucial roles in vascular haemostasis and thrombosis. The activation and subsequent aggregation of platelets lead to the formation of thrombus, a key process in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, inhibitors of platelet aggregation are important for the prevention and treatment of many thrombotic disorders. As the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is known to prevent platelet&#8208;dependent thrombosis, we have studied a series of antioxidant nanozymes for their ability to inhibit platelet activation/aggregation. Herein, we show that V2O5 nanozymes with specific and morphology&#8208;dependent GPx activity effectively inhibit the aggregation of human platelets and prevent pulmonary thromboembolism in mice. Crucially, the nanozymes do not lead to the unwanted side effect of bleeding, which is important in the development of more effective and safe antithrombotic agents.

         <title>Liquid Coordination Polymers with Anhydrous Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional liquid coordination polymers near ambient conditions are prepared by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier. This process disrupts extended coordination networks, producing a stable liquid. Liquid properties are controlled by tuning the ratio of network modifiers, resulting in anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa&#183;s at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Liquid states in coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically considered transient intermediates in the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;glass transformations of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. However, their potential as functional materials has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by the unique properties of ionic liquids, organic liquids, and liquid metals, we explore liquid CPs as a platform for novel functionalities distinct from those of their crystalline and glass counterparts. Here, we present a strategy to achieve functional liquid CPs near ambient conditions by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier, shifting compositions away from stoichiometric ratios. This process disrupts extended coordination networks during melting, producing a stable liquid state. By tuning the ratio of network modifiers, we achieve control over liquid properties, including anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa&#183;s at 303&#160;K. These findings demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid CPs, introducing them as a new platform for designing liquid conductors.

         <title>A Synergistic Photocatalysis&#8211;Electrocatalysis System for Efficient Hydrogen Generation and Energy&#8208;Saving Benzylamine Oxidative Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic photocatalysis&#8211;electrocatalysis system addresses the I3&#8722; light shielding in HI splitting and achieves efficient H2 generation and energy&#8208;saving benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The Re0.5Mo0.5S2&#8208;modified MAPbI3 photocatalyst generates 875.4&#160;&#181;mol of H2 in 4 h, and the electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction coupled with benzylamine oxidation can operate at a low potential of 0.44&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting represents a promising tactic for H2 generation, but the light&#8208;shielding effect induced by the generated I3&#8722; greatly impedes subsequent reactions. A critical challenge in this field lies in achieving the timely reduction of I3&#8722; while avoiding the use of additional sacrificial agents, such as H3PO2. Herein, we develop a synergistic photocatalysis&#8211;electrocatalysis system to address this challenge and achieve efficient H2 generation and benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The photocatalytic component features a Re0.5Mo0.5S2 cocatalyst&#8208;modified MAPbI3 with efficient charge separation and ample active sites, achieving a remarkable H2 generation of 875.4&#160;&#181;mol within 4&#160;h through HI splitting.&#160;The subsequent electrocatalytic module can operate at a low potential (only 0.44&#160;V to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to reduce the generated I3&#8722; and oxidize benzylamine to value&#8208;added chemicals. After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H2 generation. The synergistic system establishes a sustainable catalytic cycle mediated by I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couples, enabling continuous photocatalytic H2 generation from HI splitting and energy&#8208;saving electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidative upgrading.

         <title>Topologically Entangled Network Polymer Electrolyte with Ionophilic&#8211;Protonation Dual Side Chains for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The development of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (HVSSLMBs) is severely limited by unstable ion transport, insufficient oxidative stability, and poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) compatibility of conventional solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a topologically entangled polymer electrolyte featuring ionophilic&#8211;protonation dual side chains. The ionophilic functional groups on these side chains provide abundant coordination sites, significantly enhancing Li+ transport, while exposed carboxyl (&#8211;COOH) groups induce protonation on the cathode surface, effectively suppressing transition metal (TM) ion migration. The topologically entangled polymer network ensures uniform electric&#8208;field distribution, mitigates lattice&#8208;oxygen release, and maintains continuous Li+ conduction. As a result, this electrolyte achieves a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.81 mS cm&#8722;1 and an oxidation stability up to 4.9 V. Moreover, the in situ formed inorganic species (LiF, Li2O, and Li2CO3), stabilized the EEI, enabling stable cycling of the symmetric cell for 2000 hours. Batteries assembled with a high&#8208;voltage Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 (LRMO) cathode retain a specific capacity of 217.37 mAh g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and Ah&#8208;level pouch cell utilizing an LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode exhibits stable cycling performance over 150 cycles. These findings demonstrate the great promise of this strategy for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries with outstanding cycling performance and long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Responsive Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugates Induce&#160;Diverse Cells Mutual Transcytosis to Achieve Deep Pancreatic Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;responsive active transporting nanomedicines have shown promise in overcoming the tumor&#8208;dense extracellular matrix barrier by inducing cancer cells&#8217; intercellular transcytosis to deliver drugs deep into solid tumors. However, nanomedicine only responsive to the cancer cell&#8208;related enzyme is not very effective in pancreatic tumors because successive transcytosis cannot be established among the cancer cells, which are scattered in a large number of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here are reported dual&#8208;enzyme responsive 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)&#8208;polymer conjugates capable of inducing transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs to infiltrate pancreatic tumors efficiently. The conjugates are zwitterionic for long blood circulation. Once in the tumor, the &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor endothelial and cancer cells, or the fibroblast&#8208;activated protease (FAP) on CAFs, can cleave the &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide or the prolylglycine dipeptide amides, producing primary amines. The cationized conjugate then induces transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs, establishing successive intercellular transport to infiltrate the tumor. The conjugates' enzyme reactivity and overall hydrophobicity determine their cationization and transcytosis behaviors. The conjugates with high hydrophobicity and fast cationization show potent antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer patient&#8208;derived xenograft and orthotopic tumor models. This study provides an active transportation strategy to overcome the delivery barrier of tumors with rich stroma cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Large N&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts from Calixarenes: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zigzag hydrocarbon belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have captivated chemists because of their unique structures, tantalizing properties and potential applications. Despite synthetic breakthroughs, the diversity, especially, the size of belts synthesized by fjord&#8208;stitching approach is limited by resorcin[n]arenes (n = 4, 6). We report herein the synthesis, structure and properties of large belts starting from conventional calix[8]arenes. The synthesis features multiple C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions of per&#8208;brominated calix[8]arenes with anilines and ammonia, and selective transformation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline into quinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one segments. The molecules in question adopt a unique zigzag belt structure with nitrogen atoms and functional groups located around both portals, yielding a large octagonal prism cavity. They are able to accommodate fullerene C60 or C70 with high affinity driven by lone&#8208;pair electron/&#960; interactions and steric complementarity between host and guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Ti(salen)&#8208;Complexes for Efficient Catalysis in Single Electron Steps by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the identification of an active Ti(salen)&#8208;catalyst for the radical arylation of epoxides by a CV study of mechanism&#8208;based predictors, such as the redox potentials of the complexes and their EqCr&#8208;equilibria, for the success of catalysis. Surprisingly, the by far most active catalyst features an uncommon tetrasubstituted ligand backbone that renders chloride binding to the active Ti(III) species less favorable and thereby increases catalyst activity due to improved substrate binding. Catalysis is most efficient in the &#8216;green&#8217; solvent ethyl acetate and can be initiated using base metals as well as electrochemical methods for the reduction of the Ti(salen)&#8208;precatalyst. Compared to the commonly employed titanocene catalysis, the use of the newly developed Ti(salen)&#8208;catalyst allows for the use of milder and more sustainable reactions conditions, a broader substrate scope as well as facile modification of the catalyst's electronic and steric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Branching&#8208;Induced Intermolecular Repulsion Effects Drive Stable and Sustainable Flow Batteries on Condensed Nitroxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) play a critical role in scalable energy storage applications where safety, cost, and lifetime matter most. However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, break from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain&#8208;branched dual&#8208;ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) play a critical role in scalable energy storage applications where safety, cost, and lifetime matter most. However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, break from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain-branched dual-ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3 mW cm-2. In-situ ultraviolet-visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual-ammonium structure accelerates ~40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high-energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco-friendliness, durability, and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered&#8208;Spinel Heterogeneous Structure and Oxygen Vacancies Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) materials are considered to be the next&#8208;generation cathode for high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries owing to their superior specific capacity, high operation voltage and low cost. However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid&#8208;assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered&#8208;spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered&#8208;spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1 C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26 mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi&#8208;strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Room Temperature Methanol Synthesis over hcp&#8208;PdMo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has garnered significant interest with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions; however, the high temperatures and pressures typically required diminish the benefits of this approach. In this study, we report a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;PdMo catalyst that exhibits the highest room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol among reported catalysts, with 100% methanol selectivity and without any signs of deactivation. Structural analyses, which included various in situ and ex situ X&#8208;ray techniques and infrared spectroscopy, have revealed that Mo and Pd serve as the active sites for CO2 adsorption and H2 dissociation, respectively. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is facilitated at room temperature on the surface of the hcp&#8208;PdMo intermetallic catalyst, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanistic studies, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water&#8208;gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;C) pathway though a Pd&#8208;assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature. These findings not only reveal the origin of the reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis, but also open a new direction for the design of highly efficient catalysts that function under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Au6Cu2 Clusters with High Electron Affinity and Oxygen&#8208;Mimetic Properties for Hypoxic Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Au6Cu2(C2C6H4X)6(PPh2C6H4PPh2)3]2+ (X&#160;=&#160;NO2, denoted as NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2; X&#160;=&#160;H, denoted as H&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters were synthesized for radiosensitizing studies. The NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles demonstrated significantly enhanced radiosensitization compared to the H&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles, attributed to their higher electron affinity, which increases hypoxic cytotoxicity and mimics the oxygen effect by reacting with DNA free radicals. 








Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron&#8208;affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose&#8208;dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene&#8208;functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia&#8208;selective toxicity arises from reductase&#8208;mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen&#8208;mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster&#8208;based hypoxic radiosensitizers.

         <title>Stereocontrol in Conformationally Stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building in our expertize in the synthesis of trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans via organocatalyzed domino Michael/O&#8208;cyclization between &#946;&#8208;naphthols and nitroalkenes, we developed an efficient strategy to access a new family of atropisomers bearing a conformationally stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and two stereogenic centers through simple and highly diastereoselective alkylation of dihydrofurans with structurally diverse electrophiles. This crucial step places the nitro group in a relative cis&#8208;configuration with respect to the aromatic moiety, effectively increasing the barrier to diastereomerization and stabilizing the molecular conformation.








Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step sequence for the enantioselective construction of a rare family of stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) atropisomers featuring two additional stereogenic centers. The process begins with an organocatalyzed dihydrobenzofurannulation that establishes and controls the stereochemistry of two carbon centers, followed by a highly diastereoselective functionalization that significantly enhances the barrier to diastereomerization of the C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond, effectively locking and stabilizing its configuration.

         <title>Phosphinoisocyanide/Alkyne Cycloaddition: Generation of Azaphospholylidene (NPHC) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare examples of nitrogen phosphorus heterocyclic carbene (NPHC) complexes of group 6 and 7 metals arise from a facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of phosphinoisocyanides (LnM&#8208;CNPR2) with activated alkynes. The NPHC ligands are shown to be comparatively &#960;&#8208;acidic and the group 6 examples undergo facile transfer of the intact carbene to gold(I) centres.








Abstract
Phosphinoisocyanide complexes undergo facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions with activated alkynes to afford the first azaphospholylidene complexes which are rare examples of N,P&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NPHC). In addition to quantifying the donor/acceptor properties of this new class of carbene, their transmetalation reactions are also described.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence Based on Center&#8208;Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a center&#8208;chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to enhance circularly polarized luminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). By optimizing Lewis acid/base interactions, the approach overcomes the trade&#8208;off between polarization and efficiency, achieving record&#8208;high CPL performance, narrow emission, and high quantum efficiency for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) presents a significant challenge, particularly for center&#8208;chiral systems, due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between high luminescence efficiency and large luminescence dissymmetry factors. In this work, we introduce a center&#8208;chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to overcome this limitation. By integrating a stereogenic carbon center into a fluorene scaffold, we create a unique interaction between a boron&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) Lewis acid and an arylamine Lewis base. This sterically hindered design prevents strong charge transfer while optimizing the alignment between electric and magnetic dipole moments for amplified CPL signals. Our OLEDs achieve impressive electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) of 6.64&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 30.4%, and sub&#8208;30&#160;nm spectral linewidths. These improvements yield a Figure of Merit (FoM&#160;=&#160;EQE &#215; |gEL|) of 1.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, the highest reported for center&#8208;chiral CPL devices. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the center&#8208;chiral FLP design in overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between polarization and efficiency in CPL devices.

         <title>Co&#8208;Regulation of Interface and Bulk for Enhanced Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Stable and Practical Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable zinc metal batteries offer promise for energy storage due to high capacity, low cost, and safety but face challenges like dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation. We introduce an interfacial&#8208;enhanced localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte using 1,4&#8208;dioxane and 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (emim+), achieving anion&#8208;rich, water&#8208;depleted electric double layer at both anode and cathode interfaces that suppress side reactions, promote uniform zinc deposition, and enhance cathode stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc metal batteries (RZMBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their commercialization is hindered by challenges including dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation, particularly under low current densities and negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratios. Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes offer potential solutions, but their reliance on high salt concentrations to replicate solvation structures of high&#8208;concentration electrolytes limits their practicality, due to diluent's inherent inertness that limits its role in interfacial chemistry. Here, we present a co&#8208;regulation strategy that integrates bulk and interfacial properties to develop an interfacial&#8208;enhanced localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (ILHCE). By incorporating non&#8208;coordinating 1,4&#8208;dioxane diluent and 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (emim+) cations into dilute aqueous electrolytes, dioxane molecules are pulled into electric double layer (EDL) through the interaction between emim+ and dioxane, achieving a pronounced dilution effect from bulk electrolyte to the EDL. This generates an anion&#8208;rich and water&#8208;depleted EDL at both anode and cathode interfaces, enhancing Zn2+ transport dynamics, ensuring cathode stability and deriving a robust anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Full batteries using Mn0.5V6O13 cathodes with a low N/P ratio of 1.77 demonstrate 80% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 0.2&#160;A g&#8722;1, highlighting ILHCE as a transformative electrolyte design toward real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrodimerization of Acetylene to 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Over Neighboring Cu Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical acetylene hydrodimerization mechanisms are deciphered by correlating the nuclearity of Cu site in Cu&#8208;MOFs with catalytic performance. The neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF orchestrate three critical steps: acetylene adsorption, C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates, and 1,3&#8208;butadiene desorption, which contribute to the superior electrocatalytic selectivity of 1,3&#8208;butadiene.








Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3&#8208;butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure&#8211;performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as&#8208;designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3&#8208;butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF affords a 1,3&#8208;butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3&#8208;butadiene production rate of 64&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is about 2&#8208;fold and 20&#8208;fold higher than Cu2&#8208;MOF and Cu1&#8208;MOF. This work not only provides profound insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of acetylene hydrodimerization but also guides the rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>Completing the Biosynthesis of the Clinically Important Diterpenoid Andrographolide in Andrographis Paniculata</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450s involved in andrographolide C&#8208;3, C&#8208;14, and C&#8208;19 hydroxylation, as well as lactone ring formation, were discovered by bioinformatic analysis along with N. benthamiana transient expression and yeast microsomal assays. Co&#8208;expression of ApCYP71D587, ApCYP71BE50, ApCYP706U5, and ApCYP72F1 with ent&#8208;copalol biosynthetic genes enabled production of andrographolide in N. benthamiana.








Abstract
Andrographolide is a prominent labdane diterpenoid extracted from Andrographis paniculata with exceptional anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide ent&#8208;copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of ent&#8208;copalol to 19&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ent&#8208;copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin. Then ApCYP706U5 accomplishes the third step by mediating the C&#8208;3 hydroxylation reaction, thereby allowing the formation of 14&#8208;deoxyandrographolide. Ultimately, ApCYP72F1 completes the biosynthetic generation of andrographolide with C&#8208;14 hydroxylation of the lactone and rearrangement of the olefin bond. In addition, co&#8208;expression of the minimal gene set in N. benthamiana engineered to produce ent&#8208;copalol feasibly produces andrographolide, thus establishing an innovative metabolic engineering strategy to produce this medicine of historical importance, circumventing the need for plant extraction.

         <title>Air&#8208;Level Oxygen Enables 100% Selectivity in Urea Synthesis via Photocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling of CO and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon monoxide and ammonia pays a new pathway for urea synthesis under mild conditions. Herein, we proposed a universal O2&#8208;mediated urea generation pathway via the O2&#8226;&#8211; radicals act as the dominant active species to drive the mild NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 radicals, which then coupled with CO as the crucial step for urea production.








Abstract
The clean&#8208;energy&#8208;driven synthesis of urea from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules has garnered significant interest but remained great challenges to achieve with high selectivity. Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 under an air&#8208;level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31&#160;mg gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen&#8208;free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to &#8226;NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen&#8208;derived O2&#8226;&#8211;. This &#8226;NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air&#8208;level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 while preventing over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange Reactions as Self&#8208;Blowing Agents for the Production of Reprocessable Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative approach to designing self&#8208;blown foams by leveraging the irreversible and self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification of alkylester which release alcohol gas as blowing agents. The morphology and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of these foams can be precisely tailored by modifying the precursor structure. Remarkably, they can be reprocessed as rigid resins through reversible self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Thermosetting foams are crucial in the polymer industry due to their unique lightweight and durable properties. Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycles toward circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single&#8208;component self&#8208;blowing vitrimer foam. The self&#8208;blowing mechanism originates from the in situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine&#8208;tuned to develop various foams that have an open&#8208;cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%&#8211;853%, porosity of 67%&#8211;86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3&#8211;38&#160;MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine&#8208;co&#8208;ester) network composed of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and &#946;&#8208;aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam&#8208;to&#8208;resin reprocessing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Boron Insertion into Thiaarenes via Boryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the editing of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles. However, the single&#8208;atom editing of sulfur&#8208;containing heteroarenes remains a formidable challenge. Now, a photocatalytic strategy enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes through an unprecedented mechanism under mild conditions. 








Abstract
Skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles represents a straightforward approach to rapidly expand the accessible chemical space. While notable progress has been made on the direct modification of various nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;heterocycles, editing of prevalent sulfur&#8208;containing heteroarenes, especially for single&#8208;atom insertion, remains exceedingly rare. This disparity is primarily attributed to the sulfur atom's inherent nucleophilicity and high susceptibility to oxidation. Here we present a conceptually distinct photocatalytic strategy that enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes, furnishing previously inaccessible cyclic thioborane scaffolds and synthetically valuable alkyl boronates in an efficient manner. Furthermore, mechanistic studies have revealed that the boron insertion step proceeds through an unprecedented mechanism.

         <title>Crystallization of L&#8208;Cysteine in Heavy Water Induces Intrinsic Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization of L&#8208;Cysteine in D2O${\rm D}_2{\rm O}$ generates a remarkably different structure compared to H2O${\rm H}_2{\rm O}$. The crystals formed in D2O${\rm D}_2{\rm O}$ display enhanced intrinsic fluorescence, and using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art excited state simulations, we determine the molecular origins of this luminescence and propose design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores.








Abstract
Developing noninvasive techniques that can probe how solvents modulate the nucleation pathways of bioorganic molecules in solution remains an active and open area of research. Herein, we investigate the crystallization of the amino acid L&#8208;Cysteine and show that both the structure of the crystal and its intrinsic fluorescence can be drastically altered by the solvent. Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.

         <title>Stable Diradical&#8208;Derived Conjugated Radical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel conjugated radical polymers (RPs) incorporating successive diradical monomers were prepared via a scarcely&#8208;used direct co&#8208;polymerization method. The resulting RPs exhibited attractive room&#8208;temperature quantum coherence properties, as well as well&#8208;balanced ambipolar semiconducting performances.








Abstract
Conjugated radical polymers (RPs) with polyradical structures in an &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymeric backbone have the potential to serve as both model molecules for spin&#8208;correlated condensed matters and as materials for optoelectronics and spin&#8208;based quantum applications. However, preparing RPs of this type with high stability and spin&#8208;delocalized nature presents a significant challenge. We report herein two ambient&#8208;stable conjugated RPs (RPH and RPC), synthetically obtained by an unprecedented straightforward copolymerization of two brominated diradical monomers (diradical characters up to 0.88) with bis&#8208;stannylated DPP units. Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open&#8208;shell ground state, the diradical&#8208;derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin&#8208;delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of S&#160;=&#160;1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near&#8208;infrared absorptions beyond 1000&#160;nm, multi&#8208;stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing &#960;&#8208;paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin&#8208;film state RPH exhibited superior ambipolar carrier&#8208;transporting properties with well&#8208;balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 as well as attractive room&#8208;temperature quantum coherence times (T1&#160;=&#160;1.88&#160;&#181;s, T2&#160;=&#160;218&#160;ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations. This study introduces a facile approach for constructing stable conjugated RPs, along with their integrated electronic and spin properties.

Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open-shell ground state, the diradical-derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin-delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near-infrared absorptions beyond 1000&#160;nm, multi-stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing &#960;-paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin-film state &lt;b&gt;RPH&lt;/b&gt; exhibited superior ambipolar carrier-transporting properties with well-balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as attractive room-temperature quantum coherence times (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1.88&#160;&#181;s, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;218&#160;ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations. This study introduces a facile approach for constructing stable conjugated RPs, along with their integrated electronic and spin properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Manganese Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent organic framework with asymmetric imine N and pyridine N coordination alters the charge distribution of manganese atoms and accelerates the electron/proton&#8208;oriented transfer, thus improving the catalytic efficiency for the nitrate reduction reaction.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) holds tremendous potential for remediating NO3&#8722; pollution while enabling clean ammonia (NH3) production. However, most catalysts achieve high conversion efficiency relying on high NO3&#8722; concentrations. How to catalyze the NO3&#8722;RR with a low concentration of NO3&#8722; is still a challenge due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein,&#160;we constructed a novel asymmetric isolated Mn atom based on N&#8208;coordination covalent organic framework (COF) (ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn), for efficient NO3&#8722;RR at a low NO3&#8722; concentration of 2&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. This bidentate&#8208;coordinated COF featured a robust and chemically stable framework, while the synergistic interaction between asymmetric imine N and pyridine N modified the charge distribution of Mn atoms to optimize catalytic efficiency. ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, with 95.64% NH3 selectivity and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 1927&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1, exceeding the corresponding parameters of symmetric Mn sites by factors of 1.27 and 1.41, respectively. In situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements and theoretical calculations revealed that the asymmetric isolated Mn facilitated a reduction in the energy barrier for *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH conversion, and thus contributed to higher activity and selectivity.

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Lattice&#8208;Coherent Surface Enabling Superior Mechanical Integrity for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by the interdiffusion behaviors between transition metal elements, we developed a high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathode with the durable Co&#8208;containing Li&#8208;rich phase surface. The formed Li&#8208;rich phase was lattice&#8208;coherent with LiCoO2 lattice through epitaxial growth, eventually resulting in a superior mechanical integrity under high voltages. Accordingly, the designed LiCoO2 cathode can achieve an excellent cycling stability at 4.6&#160;V and even 4.7 V.








Abstract
The growing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode is pushing LiCoO2 towards 4.6&#160;V operation. However, the structural and interfacial instability of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is exacerbated when the charging cut&#8208;off voltage exceeds 4.55&#160;V, resulting in severe mechanical failure and subsequent dramatic capacity decay. Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co&#8208;containing Li&#8208;rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice&#8208;coherent Li&#8208;rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li&#8208;rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6&#160;V and even at 4.7&#160;V. This work taps into a new avenue of surface engineering on high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2.

         <title>Noncovalent Synthesis of Topological Heterostructures Using a Site&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly (SSECA) strategy was developed to fabricate a variety of topological heterostructures (THSs) with unprecedented architectures from two&#8208;component systems of organometallic complexes and block copolymers. The THSs are composed of rigid parts of closely stacked organometallic complexes and flexible segments formed from electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of BCPs and the complexes originally in the SPs. 








Abstract
Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co&#8208;assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber&#8208;like moieties. The co&#8208;assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co&#8208;assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher&#8208;order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.

         <title>Equalized Dual Emissions from Copper Complexes via Multichannel Balanced Intersystem Crossing: Toward 100% Quantum Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissions containing equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence are achieved by a copper iodide complex QtBCzTTPPCuI, which exhibits &#8764;100% photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high twofold increased external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% among pure&#8208;yellow spin&#8208;coated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, owing to the contributions of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer excited states to intersystem crossing.








Abstract
Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, &#8764;100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.

&lt;p&gt;Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high-lying ligand-centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet-triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, &#8764;100% photo- and electro-luminescence quantum efficiencies and record-high external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% for pure-yellow organic light-emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high-lying ligand-centered triplet states into dual-emissive electroluminescence is based on energy-level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Work Function&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Entropy Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Highly Stable Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with robust mechanical properties and fast K+ ion transport is constructed by driving the in situ conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer with a low work function on a porous scaffold, enabling dendrite&#8208;free potassium metal anodes. The resulting potassium metal anode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and full&#8208;cell performance, highlighting the critical role of interface design in high&#8208;efficiency potassium metal batteries.








Abstract
The failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is a key issue limiting the practical application of potassium metal batteries. Herein, a novel high&#8208;entropy SEI layer rich in inorganic components is designed and constructed via in situ electrochemical conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer on a porous scaffold. Theoretical studies and experimental techniques reveal that the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 heterostructure, with its low work function and weak Sn&#9472;O/S bond, significantly enhances reactivity with the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the in situ formation of the high&#8208;entropy SEI layer. The in situ generated high&#8208;entropy SEI exhibits low surface roughness, low surface potential, fast potassium ion transport characteristics, and excellent mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 20.08&#160;GPa). Leveraging these advantageous properties of the high&#8208;entropy SEI, the resulting potassium metal anode achieves an excellent rate performance up to 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells and demonstrates outstanding cycling stability for 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When paired with a perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode, the potassium metal full battery retains 81.6% of its capacity over 1650 cycles at 10 C. This work underscores a straightforward and effective approach for the establishment of a stable interphase on metallic potassium anodes.

         <title>Supramolecularly Confined Catalysis in Polyphthalocyanine&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Frameworks Boosts Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether frameworks coating on carbon nanotubes, which not only serve as supramolecularly confined catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry but also suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. This newly designed catalysts achieve the long&#8208;term cycling operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a tiny capacity decay rate of 0.711&#8240; per cycle. Our design strategy can be potentially applied to a wider spectrum of electrochemical catalysis.








Abstract
Metal phthalocyanines are considered as potent catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) chemistry. However, their adsorption capability is deficient to inhibit polysulfides from shuttling, which in turn retards the S&#8208;redox reaction in the cathode. Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether (PPc&#8208;CE) frameworks that provide a supramolecularly confined space created with the single&#8208;atom catalytic nickel phthalocyanine nodes and crown&#8208;ether linkers as Li host. Electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal that a cooperative redox catalysis with the enhanced lithiophilicity of PPc&#8208;CE&#8208;coated carbon nanotubes (PPc&#8208;CE/CNTs) boosts Li&#8211;S redox kinetics and, meanwhile, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites for the long term. A Li||S cell employing PPc&#8208;CE/CNT catalysts delivers a high discharge capacity of 1,363 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and still retains a specific capacity of &#8764;700 mAh g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 1C. Our work provides insights into the molecular design of redox catalysts for Li&#8211;S batteries based on 2D polymers.

         <title>Employment of l&#8208;Citrulline as an Effective Molecular Bridge for Regulating the Buried Interface of Perovskite Solar Cells to Achieve High Efficiency and Good Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;Citrulline (CIT), with amino acid end groups (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and a urea end group (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2), functions as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The optimized PSC device (0.07065 cm2) achieved an impressive champion PCE of 25.95%. The solar module with an active area of 23.26 cm2 achieved a PCE of 22.70%, which is one of the highest values reported recently using the slot&#8208;die coating method. The strategy offers valuable insights to advance the industrialization of large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Suppressing the defects from SnO2 and perovskite interface is essential for the fabrication of large&#8208;area n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the needed lifetime and efficiency for commercialization. Here, we report the employment of l&#8208;citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and urea (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I&#8722;. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain&#8208;size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive &#948; phase to result in suppressed trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent&#8208;free slot&#8208;die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.

         <title>Aptamer as a Molecular Tethering Agent Induces PrPC Aggregation and Degradation to Inhibit Melanoma Proliferation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular tethering agent, TTe&#8208;TTe, that binds to the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. TTe&#8208;TTe suppresses malignant melanoma proliferation by triggering PrPC to aggregate on the cell membrane surface, followed by its degradation. This versatile platform technology opens up new avenues for targeted protein degradation in a wide range of therapeutic applications, potentially advancing the field of drug discovery.








Abstract
Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane&#8208;bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell&#8208;SELEX and cell&#8208;internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT&#8208;1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT&#8208;1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT&#8208;1e, we engineered an aptamer&#8208;based molecular tethering agent TTe&#8208;TTe. We found that TTe&#8208;TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe&#8208;TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.

We identified that the binding site of TT-1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on the binding characteristics of TT-1e, we engineered an aptamer-based molecular tethering agent TTe-TTe. We found that TTe-TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe-TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm-shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) was used to observe the in situ CO2 electroreduction process by designing copper electrodes with unique structures. This dynamic observation allowed for the capture of the C&#9472;C coupling process, where CH2 asymmetrically couples with CO to form CH2CO. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable energy conversion and carbon utilization. Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways leading from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C&#9472;C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO to form CH2CO, identified as the rate&#8208;determining step in the formation of C2+ products. These findings deepen the understanding of the C&#9472;C coupling processes, which are crucial for advancing catalyst development in electrochemical CO2 upgrading.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Assisted Interfacial Dipole for CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Over 22% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination&#8208;assisted interfacial dipole engineering is conducted for inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs, which could not only form more robust interfacial contact but also beneficial dipole alignment, leading to effective passivation and prominent energy level adjustment with additional charge transport channels, thus substantially suppressing interfacial energy losses. Consequently, the PSCs show an efficiency of up to 22.05% with superior device stability.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite attracts widespread attention in photovoltaic applications due to its superior thermal stability and optoelectronic properties. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and undesirable charge carrier transfer, predominantly limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI3 PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluorination&#8208;assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate the passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transfer at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high&#8208;performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.

         <title>Atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr Sites for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;xylene from Tandem Upcycling of PET and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A with atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites was successfully developed at ambient temperature and pressure, which not only exhibits efficient activation of C&#9552;O and H&#9472;H bonds but also possesses a fast hydrogen spillover effect. These properties endow this catalyst with superior catalytic activity for the upcycling of waste PET and CO2 into p&#8208;xylene (PX) and ethylene glycol (EG).








Abstract
Exploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C&#9552;O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p&#8208;xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to form Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites. The Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro&#8208;deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36&#160;h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites also drives the reaction process.

         <title>Suppressing the Interface Photodegradation Towards Efficient and Stable All Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All perovskite tandem solar cells (PTSCs) were expected to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, wide bandgap (WBG) subcells suffer from large photovoltage losses and device instability due to extensive film defect, interfacial degradation and phase segregation. Herein, a polymeric multi&#8208;dentate anchoring (PMDA) strategy by introducing poly(carbazole phosphonic acid) was employed to engineer the bottom interface and suppress phase segregation. The reinforced and homogeneous anchorage by multiple repeat phosphonic acid groups onto NiOx significantly optimise the bottom interface, suppress unfavourable interfacial reactions and thus alleviate phase segregation of WBG perovskite. As a result, the PMDA&#8208;modified WBG PSCs showed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the control device (19.84% versus 18.18%), along with better device photostability (T80 = 1200 versus 500 hours). Coupled with narrow bandgap (NBG) PSCs, the PMDA&#8208;modified PTSCs reached a PCE of up to 28.51% with device operation photostability over 700 hours (T80).</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Engineering of Branched PdCoP x  Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing advanced cathode materials plays a positive role in lowering the charge/discharge overpotentials and improving the cycling performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high&#8208;dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd&#8211;Co&#8211;P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46 A mgPd&#8722;1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12 A mgPd&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.17 A mgPt&#8722;1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40 V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and Density Functional Theory calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd&#8211;Co&#8211;P interfaces could direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing advanced cathode materials plays a positive role in lowering the charge/discharge overpotentials and improving the cycling performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high-dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd&#8211;Co&#8211;P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46 A mgPd&#8722;1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12 A mgPd&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.17 A mgPt&#8722;1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40 V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and Density Functional Theory calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd&#8211;Co&#8211;P interfaces could direct the two-dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film-like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chroman Derivatives by Group Transposition and Atom Swapping in 1&#8208;Tetralones: Single Atom Editing Enabled by Oxidative Ring Contraction of Benzoxepine Silyl Ketene Acetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom editing of complex molecules is steadily filling the chemical toolbox with site&#8208;selective modification reactions. Herein, a stepwise scheme for carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap in tetralins leading to privileged chroman scaffolds is presented. Increasing the oxidation state at each stage, the substrate scope naturally extends: starting from tetralins via 1&#8208;tetralones and further via seven&#8208;membered lactones, the transformation results in diverse chroman&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids and chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols. The efficiency of this synthetic route is governed by the developed new oxidative ring&#8208;contractive transformations of tetrahydrobenzooxepinones, enabled by intermediate silylation into ketene acetals. The described carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap is illustrated by 40+ examples, including skeletal editing of natural products and short formal synthesis of Heliannuol E. Formation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols tentatively may proceed via original mechanism with extrusion of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Anomalous pH&#8208;dependence of Ru for Hydrogen Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The essence for the classic pH&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Pt towards hydrogen electrochemistry, has been debated for decades. In stark contrast, Ru represents a unique exception by exhibiting intrinsically reverse pH&#8208;dependence among Pt&#8208;group metals, significantly challenging the universal validity of the existing mechanistic system derived from classic pH&#8208;effect. To decode the chemical essence beneath the unique anomalous pH&#8208;dependence, refined multidimensional structural characterizations and electrical transport spectroscopic studies reveal that the electron delocalization on Ru surface enables strong oxophilicity and unique pH&#8208;dependent coverage of OH*, essentially different from the H*&#8208;dominated Pt surface. The enriched OH* breaks the classic pH&#8208;dependent rule by forming hydrogen bond regulated interfacial water structures, thus creating a unique chemical environment for alkaline hydrogen catalysis. By clearly decoding the anomalous pH&#8208;dependent behavior of Ru, our work provides new chances to improve the physicochemical model for re&#8208;understanding hydrogen electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Rigidity&#8208;Enhancement and Electron&#8208;Rich Systems Engineering Robust Carbon Dots&#8208;Based ultra&#8208;Narrowband NIR Emitters for LEDs with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the controllable synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) with high color purity, narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 29, 32 and 39 nm, and near&#8208;infrared emission at wavelengths of 683, 695 and 704 nm. Structural characterization, transient absorption, and temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics were investigated to elucidate the narrowband mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the high symmetry and substantial conjugation of the graphitic core enhance material rigidity with minimal exciton&#8208;capturing defects. The high pyrrole N content increases the conjugated electron delocalization, promoting radiative recombination of confined electrons and holes, thereby reducing FWHM. In addition, the large exciton binding energy, weak electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and simple radiative dynamics of the CDs further contribute to their ultra&#8208;narrow emission bandwidths. The CDs exhibit exceptional photo and thermal stabilities in extremely acidic or alkaline conditions and various organic solvents. No quenching or peak broadening is observed at high CD concentrations, rendering these materials suitable for applications in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Excitingly, CD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000 mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150 h at 300 mA. LEDs utilizing these narrowband CDs provide high&#8208;color purity displays and specific steady&#8208;state lighting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Resonance Hybrid Design for Stable Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules are promising candidates for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs) due to their structural versatility, tunability, and reliance on Earth&#8208;abundant elements for sustainable energy storage solutions. However, achieving stability for organic molecules in aqueous batteries remains challenging due to water&#8208;induced degradation. The conjugated systems with enhanced rigidity such as anthraquinone or phenazine derivatives have shown improved stability, yet often exhibit unwanted restructuring reactions in the reduced state due to overly high electron densities, leading to the loss of redox activity. In the present work, we introduce a resonance hybrid, 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyl substituted phenazine dication (HSPC), whose redox center is distributed among different resonance forms between phenazine and quinone to enable efficient reversible electron transfer in aqueous environments. The electrochemical synthesis, resonance structure, and key properties of HSPC were investigated through a framework of combined electrochemical measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and theoretical studies. A high&#8208;concentration cell based on HSPC exhibits a low capacity decay rate (0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day at a 1.4 M electron concentration). These results indicate the significant potential of the resonance hybrid design to build stable redox materials for AORFBs and other energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive DNA Droplets for Controlling Enzyme Cascade Pathways  by Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of enzymatic cascade pathways is essential for deepening our understanding of metabolic processes and designing synthetic biochemical systems. In this study, we present a novel approach to modulate these cascades using light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets. Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends were designed to form DNA droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable  selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet and visible light stimuli. As a model system, we employed an incompatible enzymatic cascade involving glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and catalase (CAT). Under visible light, the DNA droplets co&#8208;localize enzymes within the compartments, effectively regulating metabolic flux without altering the total enzyme concentration. Upon ultraviolet exposure, the droplets disassemble, releasing the sequestered enzymes and altering cascade dynamics. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated using an alternative enzymatic cascade system comprising galactose oxidase (GAO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and catalase (CAT). This system demonstrates that light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets are a powerful tool for regulating enzymatic pathways, with potential applications in synthetic biology, microreactor design, and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronically Asynchronous Transition State Tuned from Remote Site for Oxygen Atom Transfer by CuII&#8208;Nitrite Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is of paramount interest in biology. Cu&#8208;nitrite reductase reduces NO2&#8722; to NO while alternatively NO2&#8722; can be reduced to NO at copper centre via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to electron&#8208;rich substrate like PPh3. This work demonstrates&#160;tuning of LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy by remote site modification which leads to change in electrochemical property and OAT activity of CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722; involving electronically asynchronous transition state. For this purpose, we report here four CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination sphere but different substituents at remote site. In going from 1 &#8211; 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism which was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states controlled from remote site modification.</dc:description>

For this purpose, we report here four CuII-NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination sphere but different substituents at remote site. In going from 1 &#8211; 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism which was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states controlled from remote site modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Nitrogen and Oxygen Active Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient adsorbents for precious metals, especially gold recovery, necessitates the integration of multiple critical properties, including high adsorption capacity, rapid adsorption kinetics, and exceptional selectivity, posing significant scientific challenges with substantial economic and environmental implications. Herein, we report a strategy to achieve highly efficient gold adsorption through synergistic effects of nitrogen and oxygen active sites into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs (NKCOF&#8208;77 and &#8208;78) with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites are rationally designed and synthesized via a Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction approach. Notably, the comprehensive gold recovery performance for NKCOF&#8208;77 is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity (up to 3225 mg g&#8208;1), ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5 min), and near&#8208;perfect selectivity (&gt;99.9% with 10 competitive cations and anions). Moreover, the COFs show exceptional ability for gold recovery from real e&#8208;waste solutions, demonstrating tremendous practical application potential. Various experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that strategically incorporating high&#8208;density nitrogen and oxygen active sites is crucial in&#160;significantly enhancing the gold adsorption capacity. This work provides a novel strategy for designing COFs as precious metal adsorbents, highlighting their promising potential for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Oxygen Groups Modified Carboxylic Ester Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) operating at high cut&#8208;off voltages can achieve an energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8208;1; however, they often suffer from severe capacity degradation due to electrolyte decomposition. Herein, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PMA) is introduced as a novel solvent for LMB electrolytes. The unique ether&#8208;oxygen functionality in PMA exhibits high steric hindrance, leading to weak lithium&#8208;ion coordination, which promotes the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the electrolyte solvation structure, especially in the presence of dual salts. A Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery employing the formulated PMA&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates stable cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V for over 100 cycles, retaining 90.1% of its initial capacity even at 60&#176;C. Furthermore, a molecular interfacial model is proposed to elucidate the impact of the designed electrolyte on electrode interfacial behavior and battery performance, providing valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance LMB electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiply Substituted (Hetero)acenes with a Phosphonate Group at the Central Unit as High&#8208;Efficiency Light Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>A new variant of the Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;Bradsher reaction offers access to dialkoxyphosphoryl substituted (hetero)acenes, especially to previously unavailable three&#8208; to seven&#8208;substituted, tri&#8208; and tetracyclic compounds, and features high chemical yields up to 95%, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (QY) up to 87.7%, large Stokes shifts up to 7943 cm&#8208;1 and very mild, room temperature reaction conditions. The (RO)2P(O) has a distinct effect on the photophysical properties of acenes, increasing QYs by more than twofold compared to identical acenes, not substituted by this group. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, combined with electron&#8208;hole analysis, indicated that local excitation (LE) had the dominant contribution to the electron excitation mechanism, and charge transfer (CT) of about 30% provided the highest fluorescence quantum yields. Multiply substitution of (hetero)acenes bearing phosphonate moiety and electron&#8208;diverse substituents combined with a lower number of fused aromatic rings, appear to be ideal for optimal chemical stability and high photoluminescence. The new, synthetic tool will accelerate exploitation of bulky (hetero)acene emitters for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species via Orbital Rehybridization between Intermediate and Active Site for Selective Methane Photooxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as&#8208;formed ROS by introducing Au SAs&#160;on CuOx/ZnO (Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO&#8208;*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2&#8208;pz and dxz/dyz&#8208;px. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#8722;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8722;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4. Thus, Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856 &#956;mol&#183;gcat.&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoreticular non&#8208;metal salt frameworks with permanent porosity have emerged recently as a fantastic platform for molecular separation, but the underlying guest&#8208;framework interactions within their charge&#8208;separated ionic channels remain to be explored. Here, we report the first case of guest polarizability&#8208;directed molecular &#8216;freezing&#8217; of noble gas occurring within a non&#8208;metal porous organic ammonium framework, which bears well&#8208;organized, high&#8208;density chloride anions as nodes. Notably, the framework exhibits a distinctive, thermally&#8208;independent commensurate adsorption towards highly polarizable Xe, while traditional thermodynamic adsorption behaviors are observed for Kr with lower polarizability. A remarkable Xe adsorption capacity of 1.47 mmol/g and a record&#8208;high separation factor of 10.2 are thus achieved in dynamic Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions. The practical potential for realistic Xe/Kr separation from the off&#8208;gas of used nuclear fuel (UNF) reprocessing is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations identify the presence of multiple strong Xe&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl interactions as the driving force within the size&#8208;matching ionic channels of the salt framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermediate Layer&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanoparticles Enable Deep Bioorthogonal Liver Tumor and Vascular Imaging via Switchable NIR&#8208;II Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has become an attractive optical region for fluorescence imaging. However, due to the complexity in vivo, NIR&#8208;II light with various wavelengths for different imaging sences has not been investigated. Here, we found that 1525 nm light is suitable for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging due to low background interference, while its attenuation in vivo makes it unsuitable for deep imaging. The 1064 nm light is suitable for deep imaging. The impact of Yb3+ ions and the proportion of the intermediate layer in lanthanide nanoparticles on the modulation of emissions were investigated. The intense 1064 nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525 nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR&#8208;II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high&#8208;resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high&#8208;performance fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

The intense 1064 nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO-PEG2000-DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N-azidoacetylmannosamine-tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525 nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR-II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high-resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high-performance fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanisms of Micro/Nano Structural Manganese&#8208;Trimesic Acid Coordinations for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleation and growth of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are critical for controlling their morphology, size, and performance. Guided by the crystal nucleation and growth theory, this study systematically explored the effects of the sequential addition of ligand trimesic acid (BTC) and manganese ions (Mn2+), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ion ratio, solvent composition, and surfactants on the nucleation and growth of MnBTC. The regulatory mechanisms of the crystal morphology and internal structure were deeply revealed. Moreover, the established machine learning (ML) model can accurately predict the concentrations of &#8208;COO&#8208; and Mn2+, providing important guidance for the controlled synthesis of MOFs in the future. In practical, the electrochemical performance of MnBTC with different morphologies and sizes was evaluated for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The reaction mechanism of MnBTC during the charge&#8208;discharge process was investigated through a series of in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations, and MnBTC demonstrated excellent energy&#8208;storage performance. This study opens a new window for the precise synthesis of MOFs which show strongly controlled micro/nano structure and coordination environment based on the crystal nucleation and growth theory with the assistance of ML.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Solid Conversion into Mechanically Adaptive LiF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase via MgF2 precursor on Si Surface in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (~4200 mAh g&#8315;&#185;). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion&#160;(~300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in&#8208;situ conversed MgF&#8322; layer (with coating integrity of 94.6%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF&#8322; layer is in&#8208;situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF&#8322;&#8208;1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 10 C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles). Full&#8208;cell based on the Si@MgF&#8322;&#8208;1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Metal&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Room Temperature Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;temperature limitations of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) synthesis, primarily thermal aggregation and low metal loadings, are overcome by a novel room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;exchange strategy. We leverage the weak Zn&#8211;N coordination in high&#8208;loading Zn SACs (12.1 wt%, synthesized via controlled ZIF&#8208;8 pyrolysis) as a platform for the facile exchange with a broad range of metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pt, up to 12.67 wt%) and the creation of multi&#8208;metallic species. This ambient&#8208;temperature approach significantly reduces aggregation, enhancing the exposure of catalytic active sites and delivering superior multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities (catalase, peroxidase, oxidase). Our work not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;temperature route to high&#8208;performance SACs but also reveals crucial insights into the stability of SACs under metal&#8208;ion conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Negatively Curved&#160;Diaza&#8208;Octagon Heterocycle Fused with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) skeletons with narrowband emission is crucial for advancing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Inspired by the aesthetic configuration of negatively curved octagonal rings and the multiple resonance (MR) effect, we designed a novel diaza&#8208;octagon heterocycle fused with PAHs, abbreviated as 8NN, and&#160;its phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative 8NNP. Crystal data and theoretical calculations show that their peripheral PAHs exhibit significant rigidity, while the internal diaza&#8208;octagon ring confers skeleton flexibility and flipping properties. Notably, owing to the strategic embedding and unique bonding form of nitrogen atoms, their MR effect is significantly enhanced. Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 408 nm and 411 nm, with remarkably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm and 17 nm, respectively, and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron&#8208;functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461 nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31 nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively. These results validate the rational design of the novel skeleton and facilitate the development of narrowband emission materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence for Methylaluminoxane (MAO) Molecular Structure and Reactivity from Ultra&#8208;High Magnetic Field 27Al MAS NMR Spectroscopy Combined with DFT Calculations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and reactivity of methylaluminoxane (MAO), a reagent of major interest for olefin polymerization, both industrially and academically, has been probed using ultra&#8208;high magnetic field solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy (28.2 T, 1200 MHz for 1H Larmor frequency). High resolution methods combined with density functional calculations allowed for the identification and quantification of five major aluminum sites, providing precise information on the structure of MAO at the molecular level. Based on reactivity studies with THF and [ZrCp2Me2], the main reactive centers are identified as bismethyl aluminum species stabilized via a bridging methyl group from a neighboring Al center, featuring both high chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constants (162 ppm and 27.4 MHz, respectively). The ultra&#8208;high magnetic field NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations combined approach demonstrates the ability to monitor the chemistry of MAO with unprecedented precision, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of its structure and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Compensation Strategy Enables Jahn&#8208;Teller Effect Suppression in Zn&#8208;Doped Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Site CuHCF&#160;Cathodes for High&#8208;Energy and Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with 3D channels and high discharge plateau is widely recognized as a highly promising cathode material for ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) storage. However, the practical application of CuHCF has faced challenges due to limited capacity and structural instability, primarily arising from single active site and serious Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions. Herein, an innovative in&#8208;situ dynamic compensation strategy is reported to prepare Zn&#8208;doping dual&#8208;active&#8208;site CuHCF (ZnCuHCF) as high&#8208;energy and ultra&#8208;stable cathode materials for NH4+ storage. Zn doping induces fission of Cu e2g orbitals, causing lattice to aberrate and reach stable state, while during NH4+ intercalation process, changes mainly in Fe t2g electronic orbitals help maintain stability of ZnCuHCF structure. Consequently, ZnCuHCF in 23 m NH4OTf+0.5 m Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte exhibits high discharge potential of 0.94 V, high capacity of 121.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 and impressive capacity retention of 92.1% after 10,000 cycles.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with 3D channels and high discharge plateau is widely recognized as a highly promising cathode material for ammonium-ion (NH4+) storage. However, the practical application of CuHCF has faced challenges due to limited capacity and structural instability, primarily arising from single active site and serious Jahn-Teller distortions. Herein, an innovative in-situ dynamic compensation strategy is reported to prepare Zn-doping dual-active-site CuHCF (ZnCuHCF) as high-energy and ultra-stable cathode materials for NH4+ storage. Zn doping induces fission of Cu e2g orbitals, causing lattice to aberrate and reach stable state, while during NH4+ intercalation process, changes mainly in Fe t2g electronic orbitals help maintain stability of ZnCuHCF structure. Consequently, ZnCuHCF in 23 m NH4OTf+0.5 m Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte exhibits high discharge potential of 0.94 V, high capacity of 121.7 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 and impressive capacity retention of 92.1% after 10,000 cycles. To highlight, fiber-shaped aqueous Zn/NH4 hybrid batteries based on ZnCuHCF cathode are successfully constructed, achieving admirable energy density of 85.73 mWh g-1 and remarkable capacity retention of 85.2% after 12,500 cycles. This work paves the way for designing CuHCF with high capacity, high voltage and robust cycling stability in NH4+ storage for applications in wearable aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Assisted PCET and Formation of WIII&#8208;OH in Bis&#8208;dithiolene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox non&#8208;innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high&#8208;valent metal ions and facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low&#8208;valent metal centers, as high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high&#8208;valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)&#8208;oxo complexes featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W&#8208;oxo forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene&#8208;sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV&#8594;III reduction at &#8211;1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII&#8208;OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV=O state would populate the dithiolene &#960;* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal = &#8211;3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene&#8208;S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV&#8208;H catalytic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Trace&#8208;water&#8208;buffering Frameworks for Efficient Humid Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trace water is usually fatal to gas separation process because the adsorption sites of adsorbents can be readily devitalized under humid conditions. Here, we develop trace&#8208;water&#8208;buffering porous materials with reversible structural transformation triggered by water adsorption/desorption, achieving exceptional methane purification under humid conditions. Despite the different structures, both the hydrated and dehydrated materials show high adsorption capacities for bulky C3H8 and intermediate&#8208;sized C2H6 molecules but low CH4 uptake. Based on these unique properties, the dehydrated material achieves efficient separation of ternary CH4/C2H6/C3H8 mixtures even under 100% relative humidity, delivering high&#8208;purity CH4 (&gt;99.99%) with a remarkable yield of 7.2 mmol&#8729;g&#8722;1. This work sheds light on the designed synthesis of a new generation of microporous materials with reversible water&#8208;buffering performance for gas purification under practically humid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control over Electron Distribution and Water Dissociation Kinetics in Strongly Coupled Ru@NMoC Hybrid Catalyst Realizes Efficient Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delicate control over electron distribution in hybrid catalysts is crucial for improving hydrogen evolution catalysis, which remains an aspirational target in advancing efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20 mV at 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N&#8208;doping of Ru clusters self&#8208;optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self&#8208;powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn&#8208;H&#8322;O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demoinstrating its practicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Base Electrolyte Additive Mediates Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes play a crucial role in regulating interfacial chemistry, which is essential for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating the simplest Grignard reagent, CH3MgCl, as an additive. This additive, endowed with Lewis&#8208;base characteristics, enhances the stability of the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface through bifunctional effects. During Li deposition, CH3Mg+ preferentially adsorbs onto the electrode surface, attracting more anions into the Helmholtz layer. Concurrently, CH3&#8211; creates an electron&#8208;rich environment, facilitating nucleophilic attacks on anions and promoting its reduction to form an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Additionally, Mg2+ undergoes electrodeposition prior to Li+, forming a Li&#8208;Mg alloy with subsequently deposited Li. This process lowers the nucleation barrier for Li deposition, resulting in improved deposition uniformity. Accordingly, the designed electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability for Li anodes in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cells and full&#8208;cells paired with LiFePO4 cathodes. Notably, Li||LiFePO4 batteries using a thin&#8208;film Li anode pre&#8208;deposited on Cu retain ~92.84% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of ~99.74%. These findings highlight the critical role of additives in engineering interfacial chemistry and provide a promising strategy for designing advanced electrolytes to improve the cycling performance of Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Methanol&#8208;Facilitated Cascaded Polyolefin Upcycling Enabling the Efficient Generation of High&#8208;Value C9+ Alkylaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of polyolefin chemical recycling and upcycling, the economic viability of the resultant products is of utmost significance.&#160;Polysubstituted alkylbenzenes, especially those within the C9&#8208;C12 alkylaromatic range, with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton, represent a high&#8208;value segment with substantial yet unexploited potential for further development. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a co&#8208;reactant, with the goal of achieving high&#8208;yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 &#176;C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt % of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9&#8208;C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation&#8208;mediated C&#8208;C bond cleavage and self&#8208;amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway towards the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Supported Metallic Pt Single Atoms in Molten NaAlCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered widespread attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their theoretical 100% atomic utilization efficiency. Isolated metal atoms usually exhibit high oxidation states rather than metallic state owing to the coordination with nonmetal atoms in the supports. Despite recent advances in modulating the coordination environments of SACs, achieving metallic state&#8208;dominated SACs remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new configuration of metallic Pt single atoms (Pt0) anchored on the CeO2 support is constructed by introducing a localized Pt&#8208;Ce metal&#8208;metal coordination at the interface in molten NaAlCl4 environment. The extensive Pt&#8208;Ce bonding and electron transfer from the support to the Pt atoms ensure the metallic nature of isolated Pt atoms. This work opens up a new avenue for constructing metallic single atoms and enriches the SACs chemistry.</dc:description>

Despite recent advances in modulating the coordination environments of SACs, achieving metallic state-dominated SACs remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new configuration of metallic Pt single atoms (Pt0) anchored on the CeO2 support is constructed by introducing a localized Pt-Ce metal-metal coordination at the interface in molten NaAlCl4 environment. The extensive Pt-Ce bonding and electron transfer from the support to the Pt atoms ensure the metallic nature of isolated Pt atoms. This work opens up a new avenue for constructing metallic single atoms and enriches the SACs chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sn Catalysts with Build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722; as Proton Relay for Industrial&#8208;Grade CO2 Reduction at Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) involves multi&#8208;proton electron transfer, characterized by sluggish reaction kinetics and challenges including high overpotential and subsequently poor stability. Facilitating proton transfer through rational catalyst design to reduce the applied potential enables effective and durable CO2 reduction. Herein,&#160;proton migration promotion strategy to accelerate the CO2 protonation and the overall ECO2R process was explored by Sn&#8208;based cyanamide catalysts. Catalysts with varying [NCN]2&#8211; content, from SnO to Sn2ONCN and SnNCN, were investigated to elucidate&#160;proton transfer mechanism of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8211;. The reversible structural transformation between [N=C=N]2&#8211; and [N&#8801;C&#8211;N]2&#8211; from [NCN]2&#8211; group achieves an efficient proton relay effect. More efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH is achieved with a higher content of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8211; groups in structures. Among these catalysts, SnNCN showed a current density of 450 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 360 mV, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.4% for HCOO&#8211; production and a peak cathodic energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 79.6%. Furthermore, it produced formate (HCOO&#8722;) continuously for over 110 h at 200 mA cm&#8722;2 and pure formic acid (HCOOH) solution for 192 h at 135.8 mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides a novel material&#160;and fresh perspective for the design of efficient ECO2R catalysts.</dc:description>
