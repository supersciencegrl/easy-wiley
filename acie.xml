         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acidic PtIr Multipods Enable High&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics concomitant with the high overpotentials and parasitic reactions from cathodes and solvents is the major challenge in aprotic lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O  2  ) batteries. Designing efficient catalysts for accelerating oxygen reaction kinetics is critical to develop high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Herein, the PtIr multipods with low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for improving overpotentials and stabilities. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that electrons have a strong disposition to transfer from Ir to Pt since Pt has higher electronegativity than Ir, resulting in lower Lewis acidity of Pt atoms than that on the pure Pt surface. The low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms on PtIr surface entails high electron density and down&#8208;shifting of d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening the binding energy towards the intermediates (LiO  2  ), which is the key in achieving low oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. The Li&#8208;O  2  cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low discharge/charge overall overpotential of (0.44 V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Phosphorus&#8208;Directed Borylation of C(sp2)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectacular progress has recently been achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H borylation of phosphines as well as directed electrophilic C&#8210;H borylation. As shown here, P&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation provides a new, straightforward, and efficient access to phosphine&#8208;boranes. It operates under metal&#8208;free conditions and leverages simple, readily available substrates. It is applicable to a broad range of backbones (naphthyl, biphenyl,  N  &#8208;phenylpyrrole, binaphthyl, benzyl, naphthylmethyl) and gives facile access to various substitution patterns at boron (by varying the boron electrophile or post&#8208;derivatizing the borane moiety). NMR monitoring supports the involvement of P&#8208;stabilized borenium cations as key intermediates. DFT calculations reveal the existence and stabilizing effect of &#960;&#8208;arene/boron interactions in the (biphenyl)(  i  &#8208;Pr)  2  P&#8594;BBr  2  +  species.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Chirality: A mine for catalysis and structure discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, exploited by Nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of protocols able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists to exploit their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methodologies reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional protocols that are expected to come in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Transport of Molecular Cargo by Interaction with Virus&#8208;like Particle RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombinant virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) derived from  Leviviridae  virions contain substantial amounts of cellular and plasmid&#8208;derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye, thiazole orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying length, end&#8208;functionalized with TO, were rapidly captured by VLPs up to approximately 50% of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO&#8208;PEG binding included a significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20&#8208;120 hours following simple reversible first&#8208;order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a simple and powerful method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of functional molecules from nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of modifications to the capsid protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Maximizing Electroactive Sites in a Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Significantly Improved Carbon Dioxide Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of functional 3D COFs with irreversible bond is challenging. Herein, 3D imide&#8208;bonded COFs were constructed via the imidization reaction between phthalocyanine&#8208;based tetraanhydride and 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantine. These two 3D COFs are made up of interpenetrated pts networks according to powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption analyses. CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 doped with carbon black has been employed to fabricate the electrocatalytic cathode towards CO2 reduction reaction within KHCO3 aqueous solution, displaying the Faradaic efficiency of 88&#8722;96% for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at the voltage range of &#8722;0.60~&#8722;1.00 V (vs. RHE). In particular, the 3D porous structure of CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 enables the active electrocatalytic centers occupying 32.7% of total cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits, thus giving a large current density (jCO) of &#8722;31.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.90 V. These two parameters are significantly improved than the excellent 2D COF analogue (CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;1, 5.1%&amp;21.2 mA).</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination Reactions by a Formal C&#8209;H Functionalization/Defluorination Reaction with Diazoacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photolysis of diazoalkanes to conduct singlet carbene transfer reactions of colored diazoalkanes has recently attracted significant interest in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a photocatalytic approach that allows the access of triplet carbene intermediates via energy transfer to conduct highly efficient gemdifluoroolefination reactions with  &#945;  &#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. The use of a tertiary amines proved pivotal to unlock this unusual reaction pathway and to prevent undesired cyclopropanation pathways. The amine further facilitates the ultimate abstraction of fluoride to yield gem&#8208;difluoroolefins (43&#160;examples, up to 88% yield), which is supported by experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies. We explored this synthesis method with a broad substrate scope, ranging from simple olefins and heterocyclic olefins towards the decoration of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Access to 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutylboronic Esters by Consecutive Radical Additions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach to substituted cyclobutylboronic esters is described. It proceeds by successive intermolecular radical additions of xanthates to pinacolato 1&#8208;cyclobutenylboronate and to pinacolato bicyclo[1.1.0]but&#8208;1&#8208;ylboronate. Success hinges on tuning the stability of the &#945;&#8208;boryl radical by exploiting the stabilizing influence of the trivalent boronic ester and the slightly destabilizing cyclobutane, which increases the &#963;&#8208;character of the radical. Reductive removal of the xanthate group finally provides a range of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters. The contrast with cyclopropylboronic esters is striking, since the strong destabilization by the highly strained cyclopropane ring allows the first radical addition to take place but not the second. Furthermore, the first adducts are geminal xanthyl boronic esters that can be converted into cyclobutanones. This chemistry furnishes cyclobutylboronic esters that would be quite difficult to obtain otherwise and thus complements existing methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of Atomically Dispersed Zn Electrocatalyst by Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurately regulating the selectivity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization but challenging. Herein, a flexible alteration of oxygen reduction pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity oxygen reduction can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O, C coordinated (ZnO  3  C) or N coordinated (ZnN  4  ) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOFs precursors. The coordination environment of as&#8208;prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN  4  catalyst processes a 4e  &#8208;  pathway ORR to generate H  2  O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO  3  C catalyst with unique O, C coordination processes a 2e  &#8208;  pathway oxygen reduction to generate H  2  O  2  with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1 M KOH. Density functional theory calculations manifests that the decreased electron attribution around Zn in ZnO  3  C lower shifts the d&#8208;band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2e  &#8208;  ORR. In virtue of the structure merits of MOFs, this work rationally designed and synthesized single Zn atoms with varied coordination environment towards different oxygen reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined precursor engineering and grain anchoring leading to MA&#8208;free, phase&#8208;pure and stable &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide perovskites for efficient solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) has become one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to their outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we first report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare MA&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. Engineering the precursor solutions by incorporating volatile FA&#8208;based additives completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized by permeating 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzylammonium iodide into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which is among one of the highest values to date. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained ~90% of their initial efficiency after storing at 50 &#176;C for over 1600 hours. These findings should open new routes towards fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinone Covalent Organic Frameworks Hollow Tubes as Binder Micro&#8208;Additives in Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of new application&#8208;forms of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in Li&#8208;S batteries that can overcome the drawbacks like low&#8208;conductivity or high loading when typically applied as sulfur host&#8208;materials (mostly ~20 to ~40 wt% loading in cathode) is desirable to maximize their low&#8208;density advantage to obtain lightweight, portable or high energy&#8208;density devices. Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as micro&#8208;additives of binders (~1 wt% in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow&#8208;tubes have been prepared as model micro&#8208;additives. The micro&#8208;additives can strengthen the basic properties of binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium&#8208;polysulfides as proved by the density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode. Correlating the COFs with their high functionality and porosity, as well as their new application&#8208;forms of micro&#8208;additives with boosted performances, could provide new insights to conquer the fundamental challenges in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photoinitiated  anti  &#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes using SF  5  Cl and (TMS)  3  SiH as the hydrogen atom donor is reported.

         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot cascade sequence to generate synthetically challenging polycyclic scaffolds is reported utilizing a novel Lewis acid gold catalyst for the key cyclization step, enabling the divergent synthesis of both 6,6,5 tricyclic and 6,6,6,5 tetracyclic cores through both ligand and reaction condition control.

         <title>Precise Spatial Designed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Energy Transfer and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy transfer process (EnT) to elongate the charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce the self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H  4  TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8209;benzoic acid)pyrene (H  4  TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, these donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process, as well as high degree of site isolation. Two templates, the donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor&#8208;NS, and the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor&#8208;NS catalysts were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to their site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts. This research provides a potential direction to guide future photocatalyst designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Triggers Fluoroalkylation: Nucleophilic Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation with DBBF and CsF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF  3  )  3  C  &#8722;  species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro  tert  &#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro  tert  &#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;  tert  butylated product  3t  was successfully applied in  1  H&#8208; and  19  Fmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24686-24693, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two biantennary N&#8208;glycans with asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialic acid groups were synthesized through a convergent approach that also enabled the first chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan (see scheme). The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is protected as NAc2 to improve reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylation to the branched mannose in an ether solvent, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylation reactions was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialyl N&#8208;glycans were also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated N&#8208;glycans revealed a difference in the recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effects of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.

         <title>Coupling Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Oxidation over Carbon Cloth with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction for Nitrate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24605-24611, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) removal from exhaust is necessary because it presents an environmental concern. Previously reported techniques for NO removal are non&#8208;economical and do not utilize NO waste. NO electrocatalytic oxidation served as the anode substitution reaction. Over a piece of carbon cloth, NO elimination, sustainable nitrate synthesis, and hydrogen production were achieved electrocatalytically.







Abstract
NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and sacrifice of value&#8208;added chemicals. Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as a promising anode substitution reaction to couple with the hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V were applied to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.

         <title>Siloxy Esters as Traceless Activators of Carboxylic Acids: Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Aldol Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24598-24604, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a chiral boron&#8208;catalyzed, carboxylic acid&#8208;selective asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates at late stages for the first time. Computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity through Si/B enediolates acting as the active species.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is among the most useful reactions in organic synthesis. Despite the existence of many prominent reports, however, the late&#8208;stage, chemoselective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction of multifunctional substrates is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we identified that in situ pre&#8208;conversion of carboxylic acids to siloxy esters facilitated the boron&#8208;catalyzed direct aldol reaction, leading to the development of carboxylic acid&#8208;selective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates. Combining experimental and computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and led to the proposal of Si/B enediolates as the active species. The silyl ester formation facilitated both enolization and catalyst turnover by acidifying the &#945;&#8208;proton of substrates and attenuating poisonous Lewis bases to the boron catalyst.

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24510-24518, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been established. B2cat2 serves as a borylating agent, but also activates the carboxylic acid substrate towards decarbonylative coupling, playing a dual role in this reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals that the reaction proceeds through a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni0 catalysts. The key to achieve this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of B2cat2 as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8722;O bond to Ni0 catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron&#8208;promoted carboxylic acid activation is also applicable to other types of reactions.

         <title>The Anionic Pathway in the Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24659-24667, November 8, 2021. </description>

Assessment of the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry of Ni(COD)2 and PhLi has led to a new family of structurally diverse lithium nickelates being uncovered. Combined stoichiometric, catalytic, and kinetic studies reveal that these hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes may be the key intermediates that facilitate the smooth C&#8722;O bond cleavage and cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers under mild conditions.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers is a powerful method to forge new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. However, the inert C(sp2)&#8722;O bond means that a canonical mechanism that relies on the oxidative addition of the aryl ether to a Ni0 centre is thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable, which suggests that alternative mechanisms may be involved. Here, we provide spectroscopic and structural insights into the anionic pathway, which relies on the formation of electron&#8208;rich hetero&#8208;bimetallic nickelates by adding organometallic nucleophiles to a Ni0 centre. Assessing the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry between Ni(COD)2 and PhLi has led to the structures and solution&#8208;state chemistry of a diverse family of catalytically competent lithium nickelates being unveiled. In addition, we demonstrate dramatic solvent and donor effects, which suggest that the cooperative activation of the aryl ether substrate by Ni0&#8208;ate complexes plays a key role in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Recovery of the Irreversible Crystallinity of Nanocellulose by Crystallite Fusion: A Strategy for Achieving Efficient Energy Transfers in Sustainable Biopolymer Skeletons**

Grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites are coupled into single fusion crystals without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, thermal energy transfer within the CNF aggregate is significantly improved.







Abstract
Crystallites form a grain boundary or the inter&#8208;crystallite interface. A grain boundary is a structural defect that hinders the efficient directional transfer of mechanical stress or thermal phonons in crystal aggregates. We observed that grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites were coupled into single fusion crystals, without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, the lowered crystallinity of CNFs, which has been considered irreversible, was recovered, and the thermal energy transfer in the aggregate was significantly improved. Other nanofibrous crystallites of chitin also showed a similar fusion phenomenon by enhancing the inter&#8208;crystallite interactions. Such crystallite fusion may naturally occur in biological structures with network skeletons of aggregated fibrillar crystallites having mechanical or thermal functions.

         <title>Unexpected Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids Provide Insight into the Mechanisms of CYP152 Peroxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24694-24701, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a cis or trans C&#945;=C&#946; double bond in unsaturated fatty acid substrates dramatically changes the catalytic efficiency and chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity of three representative CYP152 peroxygenases including OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, and P450BS&#946;, which provides new insights into their unusual catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
CYP152 peroxygenases catalyze decarboxylation and hydroxylation of fatty acids using H2O2 as cofactor. To understand the molecular basis for the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of these unique P450 enzymes, we analyze the activities of three CYP152 peroxygenases (OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, P450BS&#946;) towards cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;dodecenoic acids as substrate probes. The unexpected 6S&#8208;hydroxylation of the trans&#8208;isomer and 4R&#8208;hydroxylation of the cis&#8208;isomer by OleTJE, and molecular docking results suggest that the unprecedented selectivity is due to OleTJE&#8217;s preference of C2&#8722;C3 cis&#8208;configuration. In addition to the common epoxide products, undecanal is the unexpected major product of P450SP&#945; and P450BS&#946; regardless of the cis/trans&#8208;configuration of substrates. The combined H218O2 tracing experiments, MD simulations, and QM/MM calculations unravel an unusual mechanism for Compound&#8197;I&#8208;mediated aldehyde formation in which the active site water derived from H2O2 activation is involved in the generation of a four&#8208;membered ring lactone intermediate. These findings provide new insights into the unusual mechanisms of CYP152 peroxygenases.

         <title>Atomic Cation&#8208;Vacancy Engineering of NiFe&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxides for Improved Activity and Stability towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24612-24619, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal dissolution induced by lattice distortions was found to be responsible for the activity degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER. This degradation could be suppressed by introducing atomic cation vacancies in the LDH basal plane. Cation vacancy engineering strengthened the binding energy between metal cations and oxygen in the LDH layers and reduced lattice distortions, thereby enhancing catalyst stability and promoting active phase &#947;&#8208;(NiFe)OOH evolution during OER.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) are among the most active catalysts developed to date for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, though their long&#8208;term OER stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation&#8208;vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe&#8208;LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long&#8208;term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M3+ vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface &#947;&#8208;(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation&#8208;vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tuneable Time Delay in the Burst Release from Oxidation&#8208;Sensitive Polymersomes Made by PISA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24716-24723, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes made by PISA based on thioether&#8208;functionalized polymers as membrane&#8208;forming block show a spontaneous membrane destabilization once a critical degree of oxidation is reached. Fine&#8208;tuning of the degradation time can be performed either by adjusting the membrane thickness or by partial pre&#8208;oxidation and can be further exploited to tailor the burst release of encapsulated dyes or enzymes in the presence of specific triggers.







Abstract
Reactive polymersomes represent a versatile artificial cargo carrier system that can facilitate an immediate release in response to a specific stimulus. The herein presented oxidation&#8208;sensitive polymersomes feature a time&#8208;delayed release mechanism in an oxidative environment, which can be precisely adjusted by either tuning the membrane thickness or partial pre&#8208;oxidation. These polymeric vesicles are conveniently prepared by PISA allowing the straightforward and effective in situ encapsulation of cargo molecules, as shown for dyes and enzymes. Kinetic studies revealed a critical degree of oxidation causing the destabilization of the membrane, while no release of the cargo is observed beforehand. The encapsulation of glucose oxidase directly transforms these polymersomes into glucose&#8208;sensitive vesicles, as small molecules including sugars can passively penetrate their membrane. Considering the ease of preparation, these polymersomes represent a versatile platform for the confinement and burst release of cargo molecules after a precisely adjustable time span in the presence of specific triggers, such as H2O2 or glucose.

Dimension&#8208;tunable lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures were realized through spatial semi&#8208;confinement induced steric hindrance. They exhibit domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors and identifiable dimensional&#8208;tunable lengths, offering unique opportunities to design integrated microstructures and smart devices toward advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) heterostructures with domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors have shown great potential for achieving high&#8208;throughput sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeit and information security. Here, a strategy based on steric&#8208;hindrance effect is proposed to construct lateral lanthanide&#8208;MOFs (Ln&#8208;MOFs) epitaxial heterostructures, where the channel&#8208;directed guest molecules are introduced to rebalance in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth rates of the Ln&#8208;MOFs microrods and eventually generate lateral MOF epitaxial heterostructures with controllable aspect ratios. A library of lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures are acquired through a stepwise epitaxial growth procedure, from which rational modulation of each domain with specific lanthanide doping species allows for definition of photonic barcodes in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) domain with remarkably enlarged encoding capacity. The results provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the use of modulators in governing crystallite morphology for spatially assembling multifunctional heterostructures.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24549-24557, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) transmission is a critical challenge in chiroptical research but there are two questions on CPL transmission. How to transfer CPL within intermolecular systems? And can achiral emitters emit CPL? We find the CPL transmission is critically dependent on the resonance transfer, which was attributed to unique circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET).







Abstract
The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. We report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore acts as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of C&#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep it far beyond the resonance distance. This C&#8208;FRET mode provides a de&#8197;novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.

A ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with excellent ion transport capability and stable interface chemistry is developed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability and superior performances of solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/lithium metal batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C. The ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism is identified by solid&#8208;state NMR.







Abstract
Severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and Li metal anode restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which enables the solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries to cycle 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), greatly enhancing its electrochemical stability and suppressing the side reactions. We identify the ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid&#8208;state NMR. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid&#8208;state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;Severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) cathode and Li metal anode restrict the cycling performance of solid-state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic-polymer-anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which enables the solid-state NCM811/Li batteries to cycle 1500 times. The Li&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), greatly enhancing its electrochemical stability and suppressing the side reactions. We identify the ceramic-polymer-liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs-PVDF-DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li substitution behavior via solid-state NMR. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs-PVDF-DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid-state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable and Cooperative Catalysis for Enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction with Varied Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24573-24581, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilize diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carboxaldehyde and regioisomers in Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. Compatibility was enabled by fine tuning the achiral carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst in the presence of chiral peptidic squaramide. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by stereoselective synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of medicinally related molecules, including U.S. FDA approved drug Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein we report an organocatalytic enantioselective functionalization of heterocyclic carboxaldehydes via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction. Through careful pairing of novel squaramide and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, our method tolerates a breadth of heterocycles, enabling preparation of a series of heterocycle conjugated &#946;&#8208;(tetrahydro)carbolines in good yield and enantioselectivity. Careful selection of carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst is essential for toleration of a variety of regioisomeric heterocycles. Utility is demonstrated via the three&#8208;step stereoselective preparation of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of potent selective estrogen receptor downregulator and U.S. FDA approved drug Tadalafil.

         <title>Identifying the Evolution of Selenium&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Modulated MoSe2 Precatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24558-24565, November 8, 2021. </description>

SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 was synthesized via a scalable salt&#8208;templated approach and investigated as a precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. MoSeS was identified as the actual electrocatalyst, which promoted conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S. When assembled into a battery, an impressive performance was observed, even with an elevated sulfur loading (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with a low electrolyte usage (4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S).







Abstract
Witnessing compositional evolution and identifying the catalytically active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li&#8211;S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive. We report the scalable salt&#8208;templated synthesis of Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;incorporated MoSe2 architecture (SeVs&#8208;MoSe2) and reveal the phase evolution of the defective precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 to MoSeS. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. The Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; 4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S). This work elucidates the design strategies and catalytic mechanisms of efficient electrocatalysts bearing defects.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Reveals Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24534-24542, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell mass spectrometric method based on a dielectric barrier discharge ionization source was used to analyze multiple metabolites in different cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) at the single&#8208;cell level with a throughput of around 38 cells per minute.







Abstract
Even populations of clonal cells are heterogeneous, which requires high&#8208;throughput analysis methods with single&#8208;cell sensitivity. Here, we propose a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell analytical method based on active capillary dielectric barrier discharge ionization mass spectrometry, which can analyze multiple metabolites in single cells at a rate of 38 cells/minute. Multiple cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) were discriminated successfully. We found evidence for abnormal lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells. We also analyzed gene expression in a cancer genome atlas dataset and found that the mRNA level of a critical enzyme of lipid synthesis (ATP citrate lyase, ACLY) was upregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, both an ACLY chemical inhibitor and a siRNA approach targeting ACLY could suppress the viability of PDAC cells. A significant reduction in lipid content in treated cells indicates that ACLY could be a potential target for treating pancreatic cancer.

         <title>O2&#8208;Assisted Four&#8208;Component Reaction of Vinyl Magnesium Bromide with Chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;Butanesulfinyl Imines To Form syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>

Old reagent with a new use: Vinyl magnesium bromide, a widely used Grignard reagent, can be oxygenated with O2 to give a magnesium enolate intermediate. This enables a four&#8208;component reaction that efficiently converts chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine into a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step.







Abstract
An O2&#8208;assisted, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;I) with O2 (component&#8208;II) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine (component&#8208;III) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;IV). The approach allows diastereoselective synthesis of anti/syn&#8208; and syn/syn&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diols in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The method was illustrated in an efficient, four&#8208;step synthesis of piperidine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;ethylnorlobelol.

The method was illustrated in an efficient, four-step synthesis of piperidine alkaloid (&#8722;)-2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-ethylnorlobelol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bound Dense Micelle Brush Supports for Continuous Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24637-24643, November 8, 2021. </description>

Forest&#8208;like micellar brushes fabricated under an ambient environment in glass capillaries enable flexible decoration of various nanocatalysts and subsequently permit a broad range of continuous flow transformations. Notably, this strategy is feasible for short and long capillaries, allowing the preparation of flow reactors with significantly higher throughput.







Abstract
Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in&#8197;situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions, and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.

Covalently attaching photoacids and photobases to the surface of a polymer makes it possible to change the concentration of protons and hydroxides within the polymer upon irradiation with light. Such a change in charge carriers results in a light&#8208;modulated increase in the ionic conductivity across the polymer.







Abstract
Light is a convenient source of energy and the heart of light&#8208;harvesting natural systems and devices. Here, we show light&#8208;modulation of both the chemical nature and ionic charge carrier concentration within a protein&#8208;based biopolymer that was covalently functionalized with photoacids or photobases. We explore the capability of the biopolymer&#8208;tethered photoacids and photobases to undergo excited&#8208;state proton transfer and capture, respectively. Electrical measurements show that both the photoacid&#8208; and photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymers exhibit an impressive light&#8208;modulated increase in ionic conductivity. Whereas cationic protons are the charge carriers for the photoacid&#8208;functionalized biopolymer, water&#8208;derived anionic hydroxides are the suggested charge carriers for the photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymer. Our work introduces a versatile toolbox to photomodulate both protons and hydroxides as charge carriers in polymers, which can be of interest for a variety of applications.

         <title>Reversible Dissociation of a Dialumene**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24702-24708, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly trans&#8208;bent dialumene has marginal Al=Al double&#8208;bond character and, in solution, can dissociate into monomeric aluminyl fragments. Reactivity studies reveal that both the dialuminene and aluminyl monomer can be trapped by varying the reaction partner. DFT calculations elaborate the origins of the extreme trans&#8208;bending, weak Al=Al bond, and define substituent effects in dialumenes.







Abstract
Dialumenes are neutral AlI compounds with Al=Al multiple bonds. We report the isolation of an amidophosphine&#8208;supported dialumene. Our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational DFT analyses reveal a long and extreme trans&#8208;bent Al=Al bond with a low dissociation energy and bond order. In solution, the dialumene can dissociate into monomeric AlI species. Reactivity studies reveal two modes of reaction: as dialumene or as aluminyl monomers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Frequency Fingerprint for Ion Interaction Networks in a Confined Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24582-24587, November 8, 2021. </description>

An advanced frequency spectral method was developed for the qualitative and spectral analysis of the ion interaction networks inside a nanopore. This method decodes the frequency fingerprint from the highly noisy ionic current trace, which achieves classification, characterization, and prediction of the ion interaction networks inside a nanopore.







Abstract
The transport of molecules and ions through biological nanopores is governed by interaction networks among restricted ions, transported molecules, and residue moieties at pore inner walls. However, identification of such weak ion fluctuations from only few tens of ions inside nanopore is hard to achieve owing to electrochemical measurement limitations. Here, we developed an advanced frequency method to achieve qualitative and spectral analysis of ion interaction networks inside a nanopore. The peak frequency fm reveals the dissociation rate between nanopore and ions; the peak amplitude am depicts the amount of combined ions with the nanopore after interaction equilibrium. A mathematical model for single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint achieved the prediction of interaction characteristics of mutant nanopores. This single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint is important for classification, characterization, and prediction of synergetic interaction networks inside nanoconfinement.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Splicing Strategy for Constructing a Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for UDP&#8208;Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24566-24572, November 8, 2021. </description>

A highly selective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (HHC) for UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) was developed using a &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy. HHC could be used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals. In addition, it could be used to evaluate the bile excretion function and as a high&#8208;throughput screening tool for the rapid discovery of potential UGT1A1 inhibitors.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for the clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity and on&#8211;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, HHC, for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720&#8197;nm after UGT1A1 metabolism. HHC was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for the clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity and on&#8211;off or blue-shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular-splicing&#8221; strategy to construct a highly selective near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, &lt;b&gt;HHC&lt;/b&gt;, for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720&#8197;nm after UGT1A1 metabolism. &lt;b&gt;HHC&lt;/b&gt; was then successfully used for the real-time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform-specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high-throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naphthodithiophene Diimide Based Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanopillar Molecules</title>

Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanopillar molecules based on naphthodithiophene diimide feature rigid pillar shapes along with a wealth of unique optical and chiral properties, which render them ideal building blocks for constructing important two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The synthesis, structures, and properties of [4]cyclonaphthodithiophene diimides ([4]C&#8208;NDTIs) are described. NDTIs as important n&#8208;type building blocks were catenated in the &#945;&#8208;positions of thiophene rings via an unusual electrochemical&#8208;oxidation&#8208;promoted macrocyclization route. The thiophene&#8211;thiophene junction in [4]C&#8208;NDTIs results in an ideal pillar shape. This interesting topology, along with appealing electronic and optical properties inherited from the NDTI units, endows the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs with both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorptions, strong excitonic coupling, and tight encapsulation of C60. Stable orientations of the NDTI units in the nanopillars lead to stable inherent chirality, which enables detailed circular dichroism studies on the impact of isomeric structures on &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Remarkably, the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules have great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for the development of multifunctional organic materials.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid Chelator that Can Remove Cu2+ from Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides and Stop the Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</title>

Cu&#8208;chelation from amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide complexes is a known approach towards the development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Herein we describe a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that removes Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn, forming the thermodynamically stable Cu&#8211;chelator complex, and by this enables the inhibition of ROS production in a reducing environment at physiological pH.







Abstract
Cu bound to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides can act as a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuropathologic degradation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An excellent therapeutic approach is to use a chelator that can selectively remove Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946;. This chelator should compete with Zn2+ ions (Zn) that are present in the synaptic cleft while forming a nontoxic Cu complex. Herein we describe P3, a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that selectively removes Cu2+ from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn and prevent the formation of ROS even in a reductive environment. We demonstrate, based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, that although P3 extracts Zn from Cu,Zn&#8211;A&#946; faster than it removes Cu, the formed Zn complexes are kinetic products that further dissociate, while CuP3 is formed as an exclusive stable thermodynamic product. Our unique findings, combined with the bioavailability of peptoids, make P3 an excellent drug candidate in the context of AD.

         <title>High&#8208;Performant All&#8208;Organic Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by PTCDA Electrodes and a Hybrid Na/Mg Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24709-24715, November 8, 2021. </description>

PTCDA is for the first time implemented as an anode active material for aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries, with a novel &#8220;hybrid&#8221; aqueous electrolyte based on inexpensive non&#8208;fluorinated salts. The hybrid electrolyte supresses material dissolution during cycling and enables all&#8208;organic electrodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies.







Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all&#8208;organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non&#8208;fluorinated Na/Mg&#8208;salts, it displays favourable physico&#8208;chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &gt;3&#8197;V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long&#8208;term sustainability, and improved safety.

Nickel complexes with simple naphthyridine ligands undergo facile aerobic oxidation to stable, isolated NiIII organometallic complexes, in which Ni&#8211;CF3 bond homolysis is observed upon irradiation with blue LED light. These complexes catalyze photoinduced C&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation in arenes and heteroarenes.







Abstract
We describe a series of air&#8208;stable NiIII complexes supported by a simple, robust naphthyridine&#8208;based ligand. Access to the high&#8208;valent oxidation state is enabled by the CF3 ligands on the nickel, while the naphthyridine exhibits either a monodentate or bidentate coordination mode that depends on the oxidation state and sterics, and enables facile aerobic oxidation of NiII to NiIII. These NiIII complexes act as efficient catalysts for photoinduced C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation reactions of (hetero)arenes using versatile synthetic protocols. This blue LED light&#8208;mediated catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical pathway and demonstrates potential in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogs.

         <title>Photocatalytic Arylation of P4 and PH3: Reaction Development Through Mechanistic Insight</title>

31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic studies provide significant, new insights into the mechanism of the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Through the first&#8208;time observation of a series of reaction intermediates, these studies have also inspired the development of the first examples of direct, catalytic arylation of PH3, which is a key synthetic intermediate for industrial phosphorus chemistry.







Abstract
Detailed 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic investigations provide deeper insight into the complex, multi&#8208;step mechanisms involved in the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Specifically, these studies have identified a number of previously unrecognized side products, which arise from an unexpected non&#8208;innocent behavior of the commonly employed terminal reductant Et3N. The different rate of formation of these products explains discrepancies in the performance of the two most effective catalysts, [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2][PF6] (dtbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and 3DPAFIPN. Inspired by the observation of PH3 as a minor intermediate, we have developed the first catalytic procedure for the arylation of this key industrial compound. Similar to P4 arylation, this method affords valuable triarylphosphines or tetraarylphosphonium salts depending on the steric profile of the aryl substituents.

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>

Molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) were tailored for the inhibition of trypsin&#8208;induced cell injury and angiogenin&#8208;induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating their great potentials as therapeutic drugs for disease treatment.







Abstract
Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs that exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing the angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.

Like a music box , in nanopore single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprinting a rotating metal cylinder (an analyte) uses perfectly placed pins (the chemical groups of an analyte) that come up under the comb (the characteristic residue inside the nanopore inner wall) to strike the appropriate prongs or tines of that comb (confined interactions). In this way, each analyte generates a characteristic fingerprint frequency as it undergoes the confined interactions with the nanopore, as explained by Yi&#8208;Lun Ying, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;24582.

Structures of sodium hypochlorite and hypobromite hydrates provide the first direct insight into the geometry and hydrogen bonding properties of hypohalites, anions of great importance in general and inorganic chemistry. The crystal structure of sodium hypochlorite, the active component of bleach, fills a long&#8208;standing gap in structural chemistry, dating back to the discovery of chlorine bleaching by Berthollet, and the first development of liquid bleach in Javel, 18th&#160;century France. Details of this research are reported by Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263; et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;24400.

Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) multicolor heterostructures have shown great potential for achieving anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. In their Research Article on page&#8197;24519, Zhenhua Gao, Xiangeng Meng, Yong&#8197;Sheng Zhao et&#8197;al. have developed a strategy to construct 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures. The domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors in these 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs epitaxial heterostructures allow for definition of 2D photonic barcodes, which could be used for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Applying Machine Learning to Rechargeable Batteries: From the Microscale to the Macroscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24354-24366, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on applying machine learning methods to lithium batteries&#8212;from the microscale to the macroscale&#8212;in combination with multiscale simulations, characterization techniques, and electrochemical tests. Machine learning enables the development of advanced theoretical and experimental tools, the mining of valuable information from datasets, and acceleration of strategy optimization for the design and management of battery materials.







Abstract
Emerging machine learning (ML) methods are widely applied in chemistry and materials science studies and have led to a focus on data&#8208;driven research. This Minireview summarizes the application of ML to rechargeable batteries, from the microscale to the macroscale. Specifically, ML offers a strategy to explore new functionals for density functional theory calculations and new potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, which are expected to significantly enhance the challenging descriptions of interfaces and amorphous structures. ML also possesses a great potential to mine and unveil valuable information from both experimental and theoretical datasets. A quantitative &#8220;structure&#8211;function&#8221; correlation can thus be established, which can be used to predict the ionic conductivity of solids as well as the battery lifespan. ML also exhibits great advantages in strategy optimization, such as fast&#8208;charge procedures. The future combination of multiscale simulations, experiments, and ML is also discussed and the role of humans in data&#8208;driven research is highlighted.

         <title>Droplet Microfluidics and Directed Evolution of Enzymes: An Intertwined Journey</title>

From bulk emulsification to on&#8208;chip droplet formation and sorting, droplet microfluidics offers numerous tools for high&#8208;throughput screening. Directed evolution has greatly benefitted from these technological advances over the last twenty years. This review article gives a chronological overview of in vivo directed evolution of enzymes facilitated by droplet microfluidics.







Abstract
Evolution is essential to the generation of complexity and ultimately life. It relies on the propagation of the properties, traits, and characteristics that allow an organism to survive in a challenging environment. It is evolution that shaped our world over about four billion years by slow and iterative adaptation. While natural evolution based on selection is slow and gradual, directed evolution allows the fast and streamlined optimization of a phenotype under selective conditions. The potential of directed evolution for the discovery and optimization of enzymes is mostly limited by the throughput of the tools and methods available for screening. Over the past twenty years, versatile tools based on droplet microfluidics have been developed to address the need for higher throughput. In this Review, we provide a chronological overview of the intertwined development of microfluidics droplet&#8208;based compartmentalization methods and in vivo directed evolution of enzymes.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group via nondissociative chain walking and &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group to provide arylation products having an alkene moiety at the remote position. The use of &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination as a key step in the catalytic cycle allowed for regioselective formation of unstabilized alkenes after chain walking. This reaction was applicable to various arylboronic acids as well as alkene substrates.

     alt="Remote Arylative Substitution of Alkenes Possessing an Acetoxy Group via &#946;-Acetoxy Elimination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group via nondissociative chain walking and &#946;-acetoxy elimination.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group to provide arylation products having an alkene moiety at the remote position. The use of &#946;-acetoxy elimination as a key step in the catalytic cycle allowed for regioselective formation of unstabilized alkenes after chain walking. This reaction was applicable to various arylboronic acids as well as alkene substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;Catalyzed Carbenium Ion Generation and Autocatalytic Pyrazole Synthesis&#8212;A Computational and Experimental Study</title>

Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions between vinyl diazoacetates and aryl esters afforded highly regioselective N&#8208;alkylated pyrazoles. These reactions involve an autocatalytic process in which in situ formed carbenium species act as a catalyst to regioselectively afford pyrazoles. Detailed DFT studies were carried out to explain the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In recent years, metal&#8208;free organic synthesis using triarylboranes as catalysts has become a prevalent research area. Herein we report a comprehensive computational and experimental study for the highly selective synthesis of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the generation of carbenium species from the reaction between aryl esters and vinyl diazoacetates in the presence of catalytic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. DFT studies were undertaken to illuminate the reaction mechanism revealing that the in situ generation of a carbenium species acts as an autocatalyst to prompt the regiospecific formation of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles in good to excellent yields (up to 81&#8201;%).

         <title>The Dimethylbismuth Cation: Entry Into Dative Bi&#8722;Bi Bonding and Unconventional Methyl Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24388-24394, November 8, 2021. </description>

The dimethyl bismuth cation, [BiMe2(SbF6)], has been isolated and characterized. Reaction with BiMe3 allows access to the first compound featuring Bi&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor bonding. In solution, dynamic behavior with methyl exchange via an unusual SE2 mechanism is observed, underlining the unique properties of bismuth species as soft Lewis acids with the ability to undergo reversible Bi&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
The isolation of simple, fundamentally important, and highly reactive organometallic compounds remains among the most challenging tasks in synthetic chemistry. The detailed characterization of such compounds is key to the discovery of novel bonding scenarios and reactivity. The dimethylbismuth cation, [BiMe2(SbF6)] (1), has been isolated and characterized. Its reaction with BiMe3 gives access to an unprecedented dative bond, a Bi&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. The exchange of methyl groups (arguably the simplest hydrocarbon moiety) between different metal atoms is among the most principal types of reactions in organometallic chemistry. The reaction of 1 with BiMe3 enables an SE2(back)&#8208;type methyl exchange, which is, for the first time, investigated in detail for isolable, (pseudo&#8208;)homoleptic main&#8208;group compounds.

         <title>Location&#8208;Dependent Lanthanide Selectivity Engineered into Structurally Characterized Designed Coiled Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24473-24477, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Location&#8208;dependent size selectivity can be programmed into designed metallo coiled coils, allowing for the generation of near&#8208;identical selective and promiscuous metal&#8208;ion sites. The first crystal structure of a lanthanide bound within a coiled coil reveals that the existence of an optimal radius stems from the structural constraints of the peptide scaffold. Therefore, a selective site can in principle be designed de novo for any given Ln3+ ion.







Abstract
Herein we report unprecedented location&#8208;dependent, size&#8208;selective binding to designed lanthanide (Ln3+) sites within miniature protein coiled coil scaffolds. Not only do these engineered sites display unusual Ln3+ selectivity for moderately large Ln3+ ions (Nd to Tb), for the first time we demonstrate that selectivity can be location&#8208;dependent and can be programmed into the sequence. A 1&#8197;nm linear translation of the binding site towards the N&#8208;terminus can convert a selective site into a highly promiscuous one. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure, the first of a lanthanide binding site within a coiled coil to be reported, coupled with CD studies, reveal the existence of an optimal radius that likely stems from the structural constraints of the coiled coil scaffold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location&#8208;dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location&#8208;dependent Ln3+ selectivity within a protein.

Asymmetric synthesis of MOMs in gels: Gel phase synthesis of metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) resulted in homochiral MOMs, which were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The chirality of the gelator dictated the handedness of the MOMs and the enantioselectivity was confirmed by solid&#8208;state circular dichroism experiments.







Abstract
We report the asymmetric synthesis of homochiral metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) in chiral gels from achiral components. The enantioselectivity of MOMs depends on the chirality of the gel, whereas the synthesis performed in solution phase and achiral gels resulted in conglomerates.

We report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs2NaxAg1&#8722;xInCl6:y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na+ and Mn2+, the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (ca. 100&#8201;%) and a long duration time (&gt;5400&#8197;s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals.







Abstract
We report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs2NaxAg1&#8722;xInCl6:y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na+ and Mn2+, the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (ca. 100&#8201;%) and a long duration time (&gt;5400&#8197;s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals. The energy transfer (ET) process between self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41&#8201;%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na+, was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps.

The energy transfer (ET) process between self-trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time-resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41&#8201;%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps. Cryogenic afterglow measurements suggested that the afterglow phenomenon was likely governed by thermal-activated exciton diffusion and electron tunneling process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Here we established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the introduction of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems into one side of the hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannels. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels.







Abstract
Inspired by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), herein we have established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the ingenious introduction of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system into one side of artificial hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannel. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels. In view of these promising results, the use of artificial nanochannel to improve protein transport not only presents a new potential chemical model for biological research and better understanding of protein transport behavior in the living systems, but also provides a high&#8208;flux protein transporter device, which may have applications in the design of protein drug release systems, protein separation systems and microfluidics in the near future.

The first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. Utilization of Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction, oxidative cyclization and intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, resulted in the completion of the total synthesis with 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of synthesized intermediate and cochlearol&#8197;B clearly confirmed the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B, a meroterpenoid natural product featuring a 4/5/6/6/6&#8208;fused pentacyclic structure. Key steps, oxidative cyclization and subsequent intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which constructed the pentacyclic structure in highly stereoselective manner, allowed efficient access to cochlearol&#8197;B with the longest linear sequence of 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly confirmed the stereochemistry of cochlearol&#8197;B.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Atom Transfer from Phosphaethynolate to an Alkylidyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24411-24417, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of sodium phosphaethynolate, Na(OCP), with vanadium alkylidynes is reported. Metathesis of V&#8801;C and P&#8801;C multiple bonds occurs, followed by carbonyl migration to the metal, overall resulting in a direct P&#8208;atom transfer from Na(OCP) to an alkylidyne ligand to yield vanadium&#8208;bound phosphaalkyne complexes.







Abstract
A low&#8208;spin and mononuclear vanadium complex, (Menacnac)V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu) (2) (Menacnac&#8722;=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), was prepared upon treatment of the vanadium neopentylidyne complex (Menacnac)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf) (1) with Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 (diox=1,4&#8208;dioxane), while the isoelectronic ate&#8208;complex [Na(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)]{([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu)} (4), was obtained via the reaction of Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 and ([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2) (3) in the presence of crown&#8208;ether. Computational studies suggest that the P&#8208;atom transfer proceeds by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of the P&#8801;C bond across the V&#8801;CtBu moiety, followed by a reductive decarbonylation to form the V&#8722;C&#8801;O linkage. The nature of the electronic ground state in diamagnetic complexes, 2 and 4, was further investigated both theoretically and experimentally, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, and comparison of salient bond metrics derived from X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural characterization. In combination, these data are consistent with a low&#8208;valent vanadium ion in complexes 2 and 4. This study represents the first example of a metathesis reaction between the P&#8208;atom of [PCO]&#8722; and an alkylidyne ligand.

         <title>After 200 Years: The Structure of Bleach and Characterization of Hypohalite Ions by Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24400-24405, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fill a gap in fundamental and applied chemistry by providing the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structure characterization of hypohalite ions, including sodium hypochlorite: the active component of liquid bleach, in use as a bleaching agent and sanitizer for at least two centuries.







Abstract
We report the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structures of hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;) and hypobromite (BrO&#8722;) salts, including hydrated sodium hypochlorite, a staple of the chlorine industry and ubiquitous bleaching and disinfection agent for almost 200&#8197;years. The structures, supported by variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy on individual crystals and periodic density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide insight into solid&#8208;state geometry and supramolecular chemistry of hypohalite ions.

&lt;p&gt;We fill a gap in fundamental and applied chemistry by providing the first X-ray single crystal structure characterization of hypohalite ions, including sodium hypochlorite: the active component of liquid bleach, in use as a bleaching agent and sanitizer for at least two centuries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the first X-ray single crystal structures of hypochlorite (ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and hypobromite (BrO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) salts, including hydrated sodium hypochlorite, a staple of the chlorine industry and ubiquitous bleaching and disinfection agent for almost 200&#8197;years. The structures, supported by variable-temperature Raman spectroscopy on individual crystals and periodic density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide insight into solid-state geometry and supramolecular chemistry of hypohalite ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Innovative Approach for the Generation of Species of the Interstellar Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24461-24466, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser ablation of solid organic compounds with high melting points is proposed for the in situ generation of new chemical species. Diaminomaleonitrile is used as a prototypical precursor, generating numerous interstellar compounds and aminocyanoacetylene for the first time. This experimental method could open the doors towards the discoveries of unsuspected molecules in space.







Abstract
The large amount of unstable species in the realm of interstellar chemistry drives an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the in situ generations of molecules that enable their spectroscopic characterizations. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to decode the molecular universe by matching the interstellar and terrestrial spectra. We propose an approach based on laser ablation of nonvolatile solid organic precursors. The generated chemical species are cooled in a supersonic expansion and probed by high&#8208;resolution microwave spectroscopy. We present a proof of concept through a simultaneous formation of interstellar compounds and the first generation of aminocyanoacetylene using diaminomaleonitrile as a prototypical precursor. With this micro&#8208;laboratory, we open the door to generation of unsuspected species using precursors not typically accessible to traditional techniques such as electric discharge and pyrolysis.

         <title>Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronic Isolation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24424-24429, November 8, 2021. </description>

We report an electronic isolation strategy to produce persistent and stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling of a meta&#8208;substituted monomer. The polymer exhibited chemical robustness, localized radical feature, high spin density, and broad yet strong absorption. The radical polymer applied in photothermal conversion yielded unprecedented performance of record&#8208;high temperature of 268&#8201;&#176;C and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronic isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta&#8208;position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevents them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow band gap of 0.68&#8197;eV, strong yet extended UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption up to 1800&#8197;nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record&#8208;high photothermal temperature increment of &#8776;&#8764;240&#8201;&#176;C and striking solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of electronic isolation of radicals for producing outstanding photothermal materials.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Chuangxinmycin Featuring a Deubiquitinase&#8208;like Sulfurtransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24418-24423, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biochemical basis of the sulfur&#8208;incorporation reaction during chuangxinmycin biosynthesis is elucidated. Particularly, the deubiquitinase&#8208;like Cxm3 stands for the first JAMM/MPN+ family protein catalyzing a sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction, instead of the typical amido&#8208;bond hydrolysis reaction, by interacting with a ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG.







Abstract
The knowledge on sulfur incorporation mechanism involved in sulfur&#8208;containing molecule biosynthesis remains limited. Chuangxinmycin is a sulfur&#8208;containing antibiotic with a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indole (TPI) skeleton and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. Despite the previously reported biosynthetic gene clusters and the recent functional characterization of a P450 enzyme responsible for C&#8722;S bond formation, the enzymatic mechanism for sulfur incorporation remains unknown. Here, we resolve this central biosynthetic problem by in vitro biochemical characterization of the key enzymes and reconstitute the TPI skeleton in a one&#8208;pot enzymatic reaction. We reveal that the JAMM/MPN+ protein Cxm3 functions as a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase to catalyze a non&#8208;classical sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction by interacting with the ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG. This finding adds a new mechanism for sulfurtransferase in nature.

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant 2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;Aminochroman Derivatives via Enzymatic Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24456-24460, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalytic synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives was achieved with imine reductases (IREDs) at preparative scale, showing enantiocomplementary selectivity for most of the products and yields as high as 91&#8201;%. Precursors of Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT were successfully synthesised, as well as the Parkinson's disease agent Rotigotine in a 3&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives are key structural motifs present in a wide range of pharmaceutically important molecules. Herein, we report an effective biocatalytic approach towards these molecules through the enantioselective reductive coupling of 2&#8208;tetralones and 3&#8208;chromanones with a diverse range of primary amine partners. Metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs) were employed as the biocatalysts, obtaining high yields and enantiocomplementary selectivity for &gt;15 examples at preparative scale, including the precursors to Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT. We also present a convergent chemo&#8208;enzymatic total synthesis of the Parkinson's disease therapy Rotigotine in 63&#8201;% overall yield and 92&#8201;% ee.

The multiple chiroptical inversion in Azo biphasic liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) polymers is for the first time realized in&#8197;situ through the tail length modification and degree of polymerization (DP) variation. The amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of three stacking modes, thereby controlling the dynamic reversal of supramolecular chirality.







Abstract
While controlling the chirality and modulating the helicity is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest for gaining a better understanding of the origin of chirality in nature. Herein, structurally similar azobenzene (Azo) vinyl monomers were designed in which the alkyl chains comprised the chiral stereocenter with different achiral tail lengths. Combining the synchronous polymerization, supramolecular stacking and self&#8208;assembly, the multiple chiroptical inversion of the Azo&#8208;polymer supramolecular assemblies can be modulated by the tail length and DP of Azo blocks during in&#8197;situ polymerization. The DP&#8208;, UV light&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, aging time&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties and liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) characterization indicated that the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of intra&#8208;chain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, inter&#8208;chain H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregation, thereby controlling the dynamic multiple reversal of supramolecular chirality.

         <title>Immobilizing Redox&#8208;Active Tricycloquinazoline into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24467-24472, November 8, 2021. </description>

The 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework Cu&#8208;HHTQ with multiple redox&#8208;active sites originating from a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and a CuO4 unit was designed for Li&#8208;ion batteries with high capacity, extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. TQ was identified as redox&#8208;active with Li+ for the first time.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO4 unit into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li+ storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li+ for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO4 unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu&#8208;HHTQ (HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li+/e&#8722; transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. Our findings highlight an efficient strategy of constructing electrode materials for energy storage with combining multiple redox&#8208;active moieties into conductive MOFs.

         <title>Organic Long Persistent Luminescence Through In Situ Generation of Cuprous(I) Ion Pairs in Ionic Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24437-24442, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) system based on in situ generated ionic pairs with CuI centers is proposed and demonstrated. Intermediates are proposed and verified through a series of carefully designed experiments. The afterglow of corresponding blends can last more than 3&#8197;hours, thus this mechanism is the first to incorporate CuI ions in OLPL systems.







Abstract
Recent development of most organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems employed binary or tertiary doping. However, the design strategies towards OLPL materials with hour&#8208;long afterglow duration are still quite limited. Here, we propose a novel OLPL system through melt&#8208;casting method with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of CuI complexes: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl BINAP&#8208;CuX (X=Cl, Br and I) doped into the triphenylphosphine (TPP) host. The charge separation was initiated prior to excitation through host coordination with CuI complexes, resulting in semi&#8208;free halogen ions and in situ generated CuI cations, which forms TPP + BINAP&#8208;CuX ionic pairs and subsequently ionic solids. The OLPL lifetime can be readily modulated by different halogen atoms and the afterglow can last up to more than 3&#8197;hours perceivable to human eyes. This is a rare example of OLPL initiated through host&#8208;guest coordination that could potentially expand the definition of OLPL systems and design strategies.

The synthesis of the first well&#8208;defined neutral and homoleptic (same metal, same ligand) all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based quadruple&#8208;decker complexes [SmIII/II/III3(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) along with other unique sandwich complexes is shown.







Abstract
Reduction of [SmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)(BH4)(thf)] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) with KC8 resulted in [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4], the first example of a homoleptic lanthanide quadruple&#8208;decker. As indicated by an analysis of the bond metrics in the solid&#8208;state, the inner Sm ion is present in the divalent oxidation state, while the outer ones are trivalent. This observation could be confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Mechanistic studies revealed not only insight into possible formation pathways of [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] but also resulted in the transformation to other mixed metal sandwich complexes with unique structural properties. These are the 1D&#8208;polymeric chain structured [KSmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)]n and the hexametallic species [(tol)K(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)SmII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)K]2 which were initially envisioned as possible building blocks as part of different retrosynthetically guided pathways that we developed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24505-24509, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field assisted PECVD method was developed to grow strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) as electrode materials of ECs. The EC&#8208;SVGAs with aqueous or organic electrolyte exhibit excellent CA of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &#934; of 80.6&#176;, and energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 120&#8197;Hz with arbitrary AC filtering performances, which is far better than most carbon&#8208;related devices, demonstrating the potential for replacement of conventional AECs.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). However, current electrodes are stuck in limited electrode area and tortuous ion transport. Herein, strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) prepared by electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition have been successfully designed as the main electrode to ensure ions rapidly adsorb/desorb in richly available graphene surface. SVGAs exhibit an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#934;120=80.6&#176; even after 500&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, which is far better than that of most carbon&#8208;related materials. Impressively, the output voltage could also be improved to 2.5&#8197;V when using organic electrolyte. An ultra&#8208;high energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can also be handily achieved. Moreover, ECs&#8208;SVGAs can well smooth arbitrary AC waveforms into DC signals, exhibiting excellent filtering performance.

         <title>Hydroboration of Terminal Alkenes and trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diboration of Terminal Alkynes Catalyzed by a Manganese(I) Alkyl Complex</title>

A MnI&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and the 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane is described. In the case of alkenes anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place, while in the case of alkynes the reaction proceeds with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
A MnI&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and a 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane (HBPin) is described. For alkenes, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place; for alkynes the reaction proceeds with excellent trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity. The most active pre&#8208;catalyst is bench&#8208;stable alkyl bisphosphine MnI complex fac&#8208;[Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3)]. The catalytic process is initiated by migratory insertion of a CO ligand into the Mn&#8211;alkyl bond to yield an acyl intermediate, which undergoes B&#8722;H bond cleavage of HBPin (for alkenes) and rapid C&#8722;H bond cleavage (for alkynes), forming the active MnI boryl and acetylide catalysts [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(BPin)] and [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(C&#8801;CR)], respectively. A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes was efficiently and selectively borylated. Mechanistic insights are provided based on experimental data and DFT calculations revealing that an acceptorless reaction is operating involving dihydrogen release.

         <title>Azepine&#8208; or Azocine&#8208;Embedded Hexabenzocoronene Derivatives as Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Saddle or Saddle&#8208;Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24478-24483, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographenes bearing an azepine ring and an azocine ring, respectively, were synthesized and saddle&#8208;shaped and saddle&#8208;helix structures were obtained. Notably, two synthetic routes were adopted for the synthesis, the azepine&#8208;embedded polyaromatic was prepared by using cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide instead of typical alkyne and tetraphenylcyclopenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one.







Abstract
Two novel nitrogen&#8208;doped, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based nanographenes (NGs) 1 and 2 bearing an azepine and an azocine at the fjord region, respectively, were synthesized and characterized. Notably, structure 1 was synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide, followed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and Scholl&#8208;type reactions, which represents a modified strategy to construct NGs. The azo&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded NG 1 leads to a saddle shape, and the azo&#8208;octagon&#8208;embedded NG 2 exhibits a distorted saddle&#8208;helix conformation with the largest torsion angle recorded so far in [5]helicenes. As a result, the different structural topographies for NGs 1 and 2 lead to significant changes in the optical properties including UV absorption and fluorescent emission. Additionally, the 8&#960;&#8208;heterocycles azepine and azocine in the NGs 1 and 2 exhibited obvious antiaromatic properties.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Polymer Cyclization via Supramolecular Confinement of Cyanostilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthesis of cyclic polymers has received much attention in polymer chemistry field. Although photochemical cycloaddition of terminal &#960;&#8208;bonded units provides a plausible way toward cyclic polymerization, it remains challenging to avoid side reactions by manipulating photochemical selectivity. Herein supramolecular confinement has been developed as a promising strategy to address this issue, by introducing highly directional hydrogen bonds to the photo&#8208;reactive cyanostilbenes. The cyanostilbenes units on both ends of a telechelic macromonomer are orientationally aligned with high local concentrations, yielding [2 + 2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition products upon 430 nm light irradiation. It leads to the formation of cyclic polymers in the self&#8208;assembled state, in stark contrast to Z&#8211;E isomerization of cyanostilbenes in the monomeric state. Overall, supramolecular confinement effect exemplified in the current study provides new avenues toward cyclic topological polymers with high synthetic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: shedding light on nano&#8208;bio interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8208;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for nano&#8208;bio interaction studies and allows for scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of the recent progress of FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8208;bio interfacing. By investigating various FNAs, we summarize their biological profiles and immune responses as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts of applying FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this mini&#8208;review can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNA and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cycloadditions of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and &#8208;butanes using S=N&#8208;Containing Reagents: Access to Cyclic Sulfinamides, Sulfonamides, and Sulfinamidines</title>

         <dc:description>
By employing (3+2)&#8208;and (4+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes with N&#8208;sulfinylamines and sulfur diimides, a variety of isothiazolidines and thiazinanes were synthesized. Use of a sulfinylamine bearing a leaving group, followed by oxidation, led to formal insertion of HNSO2 providing &#947;&#8208;sultams with no N&#8208;substitution.







Abstract
We present (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes with N&#8208;sulfinylamines and a sulfur diimide, along with a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy for the formal insertion of HNSO2 into D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. These are rare examples of cycloadditions with D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes whereby the 2&#960; component consists of two different heteroatoms, thus leading to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings containing adjacent heteroatoms.

         <title>Repurposing &#960; Electrophilic Cyclization/Dealkylation for Group Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hijacking electrophilic cyclization intermediates allows for a pathway to acyclic tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Mechanistic studies indicate concerted thioboration of the alkyne precedes rate&#8208;determining ring opening and investigate the effects of ring&#8208;size and functional groups on reaction selectivity.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled group&#8208;transfer route toward the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes is described. In this route, an electrophilic heterocyclization is followed by ring&#8208;opening group transfer. Specifically, a thioboration reaction transforms readily available alkynyl sulfide precursors into alkenyl boronates and alkenyl sulfides with defined regio&#8208; and stereochemistry in one synthetic step using commercially available B&#8208;chlorocatecholborane (ClBcat). Mechanistic studies identified the likely pathway as proceeding through zwitterionic rather than haloborated intermediates. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry set in the initial cyclization step is preserved in the final acyclic alkene product, producing alkenes with up to four modifiable substituents with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Downstream functionalization reactions showcase the versatility of the substitutions of the resulting alkenes. The mechanistic concept maps onto future reaction designs, given the abundance of known electrophiles and nucleophiles for electrophilic heterocyclization/dealkylation sequences.

         <title>Highly Perfluorinated Covalent Triazine Frameworks Derived from a Low&#8208;Temperature Ionothermal Approach Towards Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks with nanoporous architecture are fabricated via a low temperature ionothermal pathway taking advantage of the superior catalytic activity of Lewis superacids and demonstrate good performance in electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks (F&#8208;CTFs) have shown unique features and attractive performance in separation and catalysis. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art F&#8208;CTFs synthesized via the ZnCl2&#8208;promoted procedure have quite low fluorine contents due to C&#8722;F bond cleavage induced by chloride (a Lewis base) and the harsh conditions deployed (400&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C). Fabricating F&#8208;CTFs with high fluorine contents (&gt;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) remains challenging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;temperature ionothermal approach (275&#8201;&#176;C) to prepare F&#8208;CTFs, which is achieved via polymerization of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFPN) over the Lewis superacids, e.g., zinc triflimide [Zn(NTf2)2] without side reactions. With low catalyst loading (equimolar), F&#8208;CTFs are afforded with high fluorine content (31&#8197;wt&#8201;%), surface area up to 367&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and micropores around 1.1&#8197;nm. The highly hydrophobic F&#8208;CTF&#8208;1 exhibits good capability to boost electroreduction of CO2 to CO, with faradaic efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high current density (&#8722;141&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) surpassing most of the metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) enhance the repertoire of protein function and mediate or influence the activity of the majority of cellular processes. The preparation of site&#8208;specifically and homogeneously modified proteins to apply as tools to understand the biological role of PTMs is a challenging task. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated desulfurative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond forming reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective installation of N&#949;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins of interest. Rapid, operationally simple and tolerant to ambient atmosphere, we demonstrate the installation of a range of lysine (Lys) PTMs into model peptide systems and showcase the potential of this technology by site&#8208; selectively installing an N&#949;Ac sidechain into recombinantly expressed ubiquitin (Ub).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) are auspicious targets in drug discovery to combat antimicrobial resistance; however, its non&#8208;carbohydrate drug&#8208;like inhibitors are still spacious. Here, we present a druggable pocket in a &#946;&#8208;propeller lectin BambL from&#160;  Burkholderia ambifaria&#160;  as a potential target for allosteric inhibitors. This site was identified employing&#160;  19  F NMR fragment screening and a computational pocket prediction algorithm SiteMap. The structure&#8208;activity relationship study revealed the most promising fragment with a dissociation constant of 0.3&#177;0.1 mM and a ligand efficiency of 0.3 kcal mol  &#8208;1  HA  &#8208;1  &#160;that affected the orthosteric site. This effect was substantiated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in the orthosteric and secondary pockets. Future drug&#8208;discovery campaigns that aim to develop small molecule inhibitors can benefit from allosteric sites in lectins as a new therapeutic approach against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Hydrophobicity for Ultrafast Oil&#8208;Water Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great potentials for addressing the challenge of highly efficient oil&#8208;water separation, but they are restricted by the poor wettability and processability as crystalline membranes. Here we report the design and synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability, allowing the COF layers to be directly grown on the support surfaces. Three 2D COFs with AA or ABC stacking are prepared by condensation of triamines with fluorine and/or isopropyl groups and perfluorodialdehyde. They all show excellent tolerance to water, acid, and base, with water contact angles (CA) of 111.5&#176;&#8208;145.8&#176;. The two COFs with isopropyl and fluorine mixtures can grow as a coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, whereas the one with only fluorine substituents cannot. The superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating with water CA of up to 150.1&#176; displays high water&#8208;resistance and self&#8208;cleaning properties, enabling high oil&#8208;water separation performances, with the efficiency of over 99.5% and permeation flux of 2.84 &#215; 10  5  L m  &#8722;2  h  &#8722;1  , which are among the highest values reported for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We demonstrate a new material by intercalating Mo3S132&#8208;&#160;into&#160;Mg/Al layered double hydroxides (abbr. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH), exhibiting excellent capture capability for&#160;toxic Hg2+&#160;and noble metal silver (Ag).&#160;The as&#8208;prepared Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;displays ultra&#8208;high selectivity&#160;of Ag+, Hg2+  and Cu2+&#160;in the presence of various competitive ions,&#160;with a&#160;order of&#160;Ag+&gt;Hg2+&gt;Cu2+&gt;Pb2+&#8805;Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+. For Ag+&#160;and Hg2+, extremely fast adsorption rates (~90% within 10&#160;min, &gt;99% in 1 h) are observed. Much high selectivity is present for Ag+  and Cu2+, especially for trace amounts of Ag+(~1 ppm), achieving a large seperation factor (SFAg/Cu) of ~8000 at the large Cu/Ag&#160;ratio&#160;of 520. The overwhelming adsorption capacities for Ag+(qmAg=1073 mg/g) and Hg2+(qmHg=594&#160;mg/g) place the Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;at the top of performing sorbent materials.&#160;Most importantly, Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;captures Ag+&#160;via  &#160;two paths: a)&#160;formation of Ag2S&#160;due to Ag&#8208;S complexation and precipitation,&#160;and&#160;b)&#160;reduction of Ag+  to&#160;metallic silver (Ag0).&#160;The Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;is a promising material to extract low&#8208;grade silver from copper&#8208;rich&#160;minerals&#160;and trap highly toxic Hg2+&#160;from polluted water.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Hydroamination of Alkenes with N&#8208;Fluorobenzenesulfonimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly general and efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed radical hydroamination of alkenes with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide and its analogues has been developed. The corresponding asymmetric version has also been achieved by using a chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst in good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.







Abstract
An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol. This novel asymmetric radical C&#8722;N bond construction opens a new door for the challenging asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization.

&lt;p&gt;A highly general and efficient Co-catalyzed radical hydroamination of alkenes with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluorobenzenesulfonimide and its analogues has been developed. The corresponding asymmetric version has also been achieved by using a chiral cobalt(II)-salen catalyst in good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;-unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal-hydride-mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen-based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)-salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol. This novel asymmetric radical C&#8722;N bond construction opens a new door for the challenging asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Stereochemistry to Control Mechanical Properties in Thiol&#8211;Yne Click&#8208;Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the stereochemistry of double bonds that are formed in situ using the nucleophilic thiol&#8211;yne addition enables the synthesis of robust hydrogels with mechanical properties that relate to the double bond stereochemistry. This approach allows the synthesis of hydrogels in which the other chemical and hence physical parameters remain the same providing a platform from which to isolate mechanical properties to direct cell differentiation.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of polymers has a profound impact on their mechanical properties. While this has been observed in thermoplastics, studies on how stereochemistry affects the bulk properties of swollen networks, such as hydrogels, are limited. Typically, changing the stiffness of a hydrogel is achieved at the cost of changing another parameter, that in turn affects the physical properties of the material and ultimately influences the cellular response. Herein, we report that by manipulating the stereochemistry of a double bond, formed in situ during gelation, materials with diverse mechanical properties but comparable physical properties can be obtained. Click&#8208;hydrogels that possess a high %&#8197;trans content are stiffer than their high %&#8197;cis analogues by almost a factor of&#8197;3. Human mesenchymal stem cells acted as a substrate stiffness cell reporter demonstrating the potential of these platforms to study mechanotransduction without the influence of other external factors.

         <title>High&#8208;Processable COF Gel Electrolyte Enabled by Side Chain Engineering for Lithium&#8208;ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with graphene&#8208;like structure present unique chemical and physical properties, they are essentially insoluble and infusible crystalline powders with poor processability, hindering their further practical applications. How to improve the processability of COF materials is a major challenge in this field. In this contribution, we proposed a general side chain engineering strategy to construct gel&#8208;state COF with high processability. This method takes advantages of large and soft branched alkyl side chains as internal plasticizers to achieve the gelation of COF, and systematically studied the influence of the length of the side chain on the COF gel formation. Benefit from their machinability and flexibility, this novel COF gel can be easily processed into gel&#8208;type electrolytes with specific sharpness and thickness, which were further applied to assemble the lithium ion batteries that exhibited high cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene over Atomically Isolated Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen Site/Copper Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to enhance the selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction reaction towards C2H4 with a 6&#8208;fold increase in comparison with that of the non&#8208;tandem catalysts. The local high concentration of CO generated by atomically isolated nickel&#8211;nitrogen sites PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites, thus switching from CH4 to C2H4 production with a Faradaic efficiency of 57.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, an effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to improve the selectivity of the CO2RR towards C2H4 by multiple distinct catalytic sites in local vicinity. An earth&#8208;abundant elements&#8208;based tandem electrocatalyst PTF(Ni)/Cu is constructed by uniformly dispersing Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the porphyrinic triazine framework anchored with atomically isolated nickel&#8211;nitrogen sites (PTF(Ni)) for the enhanced CO2RR to produce C2H4. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 57.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is about 6 times higher than the non&#8208;tandem catalyst PTF/Cu, which produces CH4 as the major carbon product. The operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the local high concentration of CO generated by PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites. The work offers an effective avenue to design electrocatalysts for the highly selective CO2RR to produce multicarbon products via a tandem route.

         <title>A Cryptic Plant Terpene Cyclase Producing Unconventional 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic C25 and C20 Terpenoids with Immunosuppressive Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cryptic plant terpene cyclase producing unconventional macrocyclic sesterterpenoids and diterpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Two variants producing more sesterterpenoids were engineered, and the immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was found.







Abstract
A versatile terpene synthase (LcTPS2) producing unconventional macrocyclic terpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Engineered Escherichia coli and Nicotiana benthamiana expressing LcTPS2 produced six 18&#8208;/14&#8208;membered sesterterpenoids including five new ones and two 14&#8208;membered diterpenoids. These products represent the first macrocyclic sesterterpenoids from plants and the largest sesterterpenoid ring system identified to date. Two variants F516A and F516G producing approximately 3.3&#8208; and 2.5&#8208;fold, respectively, more sesterterpenoids than the wild&#8208;type enzyme were engineered. Both 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered ring sesterterpenoids displayed significant inhibitory activity on the IL&#8208;2 and IFN&#8208;&#947; production of T&#8197;cells probably via inhibition of the MAPK pathway. The findings will contribute to the development of efficient biocatalysts to create bioactive macrocyclic sesterterpenoids, and also herald a new potential in the well&#8208;trodden territory of plant terpenoid biosynthesis.

         <title>Main Descriptors To Correlate Structures with the Performances of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity descriptors for electrocatalysis are summarized in this Minireview together with their merits/limitations to enable the rational construction of efficient catalysts. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover new and advanced descriptors is also described. Linear scaling relationships are also analyzed and several strategies proposed to overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Traditional trial and error approaches to search for hydrogen/oxygen redox catalysts with high activity and stability are typically tedious and inefficient. There is an urgent need to identify the most important parameters that determine the catalytic performance and so enable the development of design strategies for catalysts. In the past decades, several descriptors have been developed to unravel structure&#8211;performance relationships. This Minireview summarizes reactivity descriptors in electrocatalysis including adsorption energy descriptors involving reaction intermediates, electronic descriptors represented by a d&#8208;band center, structural descriptors, and universal descriptors, and discusses their merits/limitations.

     alt="Main Descriptors To Correlate Structures with the Performances of Electrocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactivity descriptors for electrocatalysis are summarized in this Minireview together with their merits/limitations to enable the rational construction of efficient catalysts. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover new and advanced descriptors is also described. Linear scaling relationships are also analyzed and several strategies proposed to overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional trial and error approaches to search for hydrogen/oxygen redox catalysts with high activity and stability are typically tedious and inefficient. There is an urgent need to identify the most important parameters that determine the catalytic performance and so enable the development of design strategies for catalysts. In the past decades, several descriptors have been developed to unravel structure&#8211;performance relationships. This Minireview summarizes reactivity descriptors in electrocatalysis including adsorption energy descriptors involving reaction intermediates, electronic descriptors represented by a d-band center, structural descriptors, and universal descriptors, and discusses their merits/limitations. Understanding the trends in electrocatalytic performance and predicting promising catalytic materials using reactivity descriptors should enable the rational construction of catalysts. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have also been adopted to discover new and advanced descriptors. Finally, linear scaling relationships are analyzed and several strategies proposed to circumvent the established scaling relationships and overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Geomimetic Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polyimide&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its abundance, water is not widely used as a medium for organic reactions. However, under geothermal conditions, water exhibits unique physicochemical properties, such as viscosity, dielectric constant, and ionic product become similar to those of common organic solvents. In this study, for the first time, we synthesized highly crystalline polyimide&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PICs) under geomimetic hydrothermal conditions. By exploiting triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexacarboxylic acid in combination with various aromatic diamines, PICs with various pore dimensions and crystallinities were synthesized. XRD, FT&#8208;IR, and DFT calculations revealed that the solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the stacking structures of the crystalline PICs. Furthermore, the synthesized PIC demonstrate promising potential as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion battery owing to its unique redox&#8208;active property and high surface area.</dc:description>

         <title>Abiotic Formation of Amide Bond via Surface&#8208;Supported Direct Carboxyl&#8208;Amine Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bond formation is one of the most important reactions in biochemistry, notably being of crucial importance for the origin of life. Herein, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies to provide evidence for thermally activated abiotic formation of amide bonds between adsorbed precursors through direct carboxyl&#8208;amine coupling under ultrahigh vacuum conditions by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis. Complementary insights from temperature&#8208;programmed desorption measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal the competition between cross&#8208;coupling amide formation and decarboxylation reactions on the Au(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical influence of the employed metal support: whereas on Au(111) the coupling readily occurs, different reaction scenarios prevail on Ag(111) and Cu(111). The systematic experiments signal that archetypical bio&#8208;related molecules can be abiotically synthesized in clean environments without water or oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Superstructures of Organic&#8208;Polyoxometalate co&#8208;Crystals as Precursors for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The scalable production of hydrogen through water electrolysis is recognized as a green and sustainable pathway for a future energy supply. Benefiting from similar electronic properties as Pt&#8208;group metals, molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based carbides and nitrides have been considered as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Currently, one of the substantial challenges using Mo&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts lies in establishing well&#8208;defined precursors which can be transformed into Mo&#8208;based carbides/nitrides with controllable structure and porosity. Here we report the synthesis of a series of superstructures consisting of  organic&#8208;polyoxometalate co&#8208;crystals (O&#8208;POCs)  as a new type of metal&#8208;organic precursor to synthesize Mo&#8208;based carbides/nitrides in a highly controlled fashion and to use them for efficient catalytic hydrogen production. This protocol enables to create electrocatalysts composed of abundant nanocrystallites and heterojunctions with tunable micro&#8208; and nanostructure and mesoporosity. The best performing electrocatalyst shows high HER activity and stability with a low overpotential of 162 mV at 100 mA/cm  2  (in comparison to Pt/C with 263 mV), which makes it to one of the best non&#8208;noble metal HER catalysts in alkaline media and seawater.</dc:description>

         <title>Crossed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Iron&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclohexene motif is ubiquitous in nature and specialty chemicals. A straightforward selective access to chiral cyclohexenes from unactivated dienes and dienophiles is not feasible by classical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and constitutes an unsolved synthetic challenge. We report a mild and enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated dienes providing access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes. The development of  bis  &#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligands was vital to obtain iron complexes that display high reactivities and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities towards the targeted cyclohexenes. A range of diene substrates is well accommodated including feedstocks like butadiene, isoprene and myrcene. The structures of different iron complexes are mapped by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and linked to their performance.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Aptamer&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Generic Colorimetric Small&#8208;Molecule Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are promising biorecognition elements for sensors. However, aptamer&#8208;based assays often lack the requisite levels of sensitivity and/or selectivity because they typically employ structure&#8208;switching aptamers with attenuated affinity and/or utilize reporters that require aptamer labeling or which are susceptible to false positives. Dye&#8208;displacement assays offer a label&#8208;free, sensitive means for overcoming these issues, wherein target binding liberates a dye that is complexed with the aptamer, producing an optical readout. However, broad utilization of these assays has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a rational approach to develop colorimetric cyanine dye&#8208;displacement assays that can be broadly applied to DNA aptamers regardless of their structure, sequence, affinity, or the physicochemical properties of their targets. Our approach should accelerate the development of mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure assays that could be applied for diverse analytical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine I: Biosynthetic Origins of the Elusive Racemic Papaveraceae Isoxazolidine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine  Papaveraceae  alkaloids Setigerumine I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse&#8208;electron demand 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate. The work opens this previously inaccessible family of natural products for biological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk electrocatalytic NADH cofactor regeneration with bipolar electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is an extremely important challenge for the electroenzymatic synthesis of many valuable chemicals. Although some important progress has been made with modified electrodes concerning the reduction of NAD  +  , the scale&#8208;up is difficult due to mass transport limitations inherent to large&#8208;size electrodes. Here, we propose instead to employ a dispersion of electrocatalytically active modified microparticles in the bulk of a bipolar electrochemical cell. In this way, redox reactions occur simultaneously on all of these individual microelectrodes without the need of a direct electrical connection. The concept is validated by using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]  +  functionalized surfaces, either of carbon felt as a reference material, or carbon microbeads acting as bipolar objects. In the latter case, enzymatically active 1,4&#8208;NADH is electroregenerated at the negatively polarized face of the particles. The efficiency of the system can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the electric field in the reaction compartment and the number of dispersed microelectrodes. This wireless bioelectrocatalytic approach opens up very interesting perspectives for electroenzymatic synthesis in the bulk phase.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solid Transformation into Carboxyl Dimers Based on a Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Propyne/Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible solid transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, microporous HOF&#8208;30a enables the selective adsorption of propyne over propylene according to single&#8208;component sorption and breakthrough experiments. The preferred propyne location in HOF has also been identified by SCXRD test.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine with the help of different solvents provides isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;30). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals HOF&#8208;30 possesses 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets connected by two kinds of hydrogen bonds, namely solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Degassing treatment for HOF&#8208;30 yields HOF&#8208;30a with 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets but linked with sole carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bond transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>NMR Spectroscopy of the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Fragment&#8208;Based Screening Identify Three Protein Hotspots and an Antiviral Fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the liquid&#8208;sate NMR spectroscopy analysis of the dimeric SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (3CLp), including its backbone assignments, to study its complex conformational regulation. Using fragment&#8208;based NMR screening, we highlighted three hotspots on the protein, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface, and we identified a non&#8208;covalent reversible inhibitor of 3CLp that has antiviral activity in infected cells.







Abstract
The main protease (3CLp) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the causative agent for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, is one of the main targets for drug development. To be active, 3CLp relies on a complex interplay between dimerization, active site flexibility, and allosteric regulation. The deciphering of these mechanisms is a crucial step to enable the search for inhibitors. In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment&#8208;based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non&#8208;covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure&#8208;function relationships of 3CLp and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.

         <title>Metabolic Labeling of Legionaminic Acid in Flagellin Glycosylation of Campylobacter jejuni Identifies Maf4 as a Putative Legionaminyl Transferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probes used to metabolically label legionaminic acid on bacterial flagella substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative legionaminyl transferase in Campylobacter jejuni (see picture). The labeled glycan could be detected intracellularly as its activated CMP analogue, on flagella by Western blot analysis, and on intact bacteria by confocal microscopy.







Abstract
Campylobacter jejuni is the major human food&#8208;borne pathogen. Its bipolar flagella are heavily O&#8208;glycosylated with microbial sialic acids and essential for its motility and pathogenicity. However, both the glycosylation of flagella and the exact contribution of legionaminic acid (Leg) to flagellar activity is poorly understood. Herein, we report the development of a metabolic labeling method for Leg glycosylation on bacterial flagella with probes based on azide&#8208;modified Leg precursors. The hereby azido&#8208;Leg labeled flagellin could be detected by Western blot analysis and imaged on intact bacteria. Using the probes on C.&#8197;jejuni and its isogenic maf4 mutant we also further substantiated the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. Further evidence was provided by UPLC&#8211;MS detection of labeled CMP&#8208;Leg and an in silico model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in C.&#8197;jejuni motility and invasiveness.

         <title>APEX2&#8208;based Proximity Labeling of Atox1 Identifies CRIP2 as a Nuclear Copper&#8208;binding Protein that Regulates Autophagy Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeking to overcome challenges with the identification of copper chaperone protein's binding partners, we used APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling with Atox1 as the bait to identify weak/transient protein&#8211;protein interactions. Atox1 delivers copper into the nucleus and transfers it to a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein CRIP2, and copper promotes CRIP2 degradation to induce ROS&#8208;mediated activation of autophagy.







Abstract
Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper's broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine&#8208;rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8242;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2&#8208;as well as copper&#8208;induced CRIP2 degradation&#8208;elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2&#8208;mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.

         <title>Ultrathin Crystalline Covalent&#8208;Triazine&#8208;Framework Nanosheets with Electron Donor Groups for Synergistically Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets with electron donor groups are prepared for the first time by a novel redox strategy. They demonstrate ultrahigh photocatalytic overall water splitting performance arising from the optimized band structure and improved light&#8208;responsive range from the electron donor groups introduced into the 2D ordered molecular plane.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanosheets have great potential for photocatalytic applications, however, suffer from enlarged band gap and narrowed visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range due to the quantum confinement effect. Herein, we report a novel redox strategy for efficient preparation of ultrathin crystalline amide&#8208;functionalized covalent&#8208;triazine&#8208;framework nanosheets (CTF NSs) with enhanced visible light absorption. The CTF NSs exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen (512.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and oxygen (12.37&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates much higher than that of pristine bulk CTF. Photocatalytic overall water splitting could be achieved with efficient stoichiometric H2 (5.13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and O2 (2.53&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates under visible light irradiation. Experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that introduction of amide groups as electron donor optimized the band structure and improve its visible&#8208;light absorption, hydrophilicity and carrier separation efficiency, thus resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The well&#8208;dispersed CTF NSs could be easily cast onto a support as a thin film device and demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activity (25.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution).

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical NO Reduction into NH3 by MoS2 Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2/GF behaves as a superb and durable electrocatalyst for ambient NH3 generation via NO reduction in acids. It is capable of attaining a Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The MoS2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;NO battery delivers a power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH3 production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS2 nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS2/GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS2/GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using MoS2 nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8208;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1. Calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an acceptance&#8211;donation mechanism and disfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8722;N bond.

Chemistry is central to addressing the challenges of human security in today's world, but surprisingly its role and contributions have not yet been explicitly defined. In this Essay, the repositioning of chemistry in this context is seen to present a powerful opportunity for its renewal as a science for the benefit of society. Chemists will need to play new roles and engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy.







Abstract
Human security, defined as &#8220;freedom from want and fear and freedom to live in dignity&#8221;, provides an overarching concept to address threats to human security dimensions such as health, food, economics, the environment and sustainable development, while placing the individual at the centre of attention. Chemistry is central to addressing these challenges, but surprisingly its role and contributions to human security have hitherto not been explicitly set out. This article situates chemistry in the human security framework, highlighting areas where chemistry knowledge, methods and products are vital. It underscores three complementary facets: 1)&#8197;chemistry contributes to many dimensions of human security, but needs to do much more in the light of oncoming global challenges; 2)&#8197;the human security framing illuminates areas where chemistry itself needs to adapt to contribute better, by intensification of current approaches and/or by building or strengthening chemistry tools, skills and competencies; and 3)&#8197;repositioning as central to human security affords chemistry a powerful opportunity to refresh itself as a science for the benefit of society&#8212;and it will need to engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy in order to do so.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Coordinatively Unsaturated Cu Paddle Wheel Clusters to Boost Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. Second coordination sphere engineering is reported to be effective in the PCET process; however, little is known about the actual catalytic active sites under realistic operating conditions. Here, we design a defect metal&#8722;organic framework, HKUST&#8208;1, through a facile &#8220;atomized trimesic acid&#8221; strategy, in which Cu atoms are modified by unsaturated carboxylate ligands, producing coordinatively unsaturated Cu paddle wheel (CU&#8208;CPW) clusters. We investigate the dynamic behavior of the CU&#8208;CPW during electrochemical reconstruction through the comprehensive analysis of in situ characterization results. It is demonstrated that Cu2(HCOO)3 is maintained after electrochemical reconstruction and acts as real active sites. Mechanistic studies reveal that CU&#8208;CPW accelerates the proton&#8208;coupled multi&#8208;electron transfer (PCMET) reaction, resulting in a deep CO2 reduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Outer Membrane Protein Facilitates Uptake of Decoy Molecules into a Cytochrome P450BM3&#8208;Based Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an OmpF loop deletion mutant, which improves the cellular uptake of external additives into an  Escherichia coli  whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. Through co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 in the presence of decoy molecules, the yield of the whole&#8208;cell biotransformation of benzene could be considerably improved. Notably, with C7AM&#8208;Pip&#8208;Phe the yield duodecupled from 5.7% to 70%, with 80% phenol selectivity. The benzylic hydroxylation of alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes was also examined, and with the aid of decoy molecules, propylbenzene and tetralin were converted to 1&#8208;hydroxylated products with 78% yield and 94% (  R  )  ee  for propylbenzene and 92% yield and 94% (  S  )  ee  for tetralin. Our results suggest that both the decoy molecule and substrate traverse the artificial channel, synergistically boosting whole&#8208;cell bioconversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Exchange of Substituents in a Prebiotic Organocatalyst: Initial Steps towards an Evolutionary System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All evolutionary biological processes lead to a change in heritable traits over successive generations. The responsible genetic information encoded in DNA is altered, selected, and inherited by mutation of the base sequence. While this is well known at the biological level, an evolutionary change at the molecular level of small organic molecules is unknown but represents an important prerequisite for the emergence of life. Here, we present a class of prebiotic imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione organocatalysts able to dynamically change their constitution and potentially capable to form an evolutionary system. These catalysts functionalize their building blocks and dynamically adapt to their (self&#8208;modified) environment by mutation of their own structure. Depending on the surrounding conditions, they show pronounced and opposing selectivity in their formation. Remarkably, the preferentially formed species can be associated with different catalytic properties, which enable multiple pathways for the transition from abiotic matter to functional biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of [1.1.1]Propellane for the Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies commonly used for the synthesis of functionalised bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) rely on the reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with anionic or radical intermediates. In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron&#8208;neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen&#8208;substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery. A detailed computational analysis indicates that the key halogen bonding interaction promotes nucleophilic attack without sacrificing cage stabilisation. Overall, our work rehabilitates electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane as a valuable strategy for accessing functionalised BCPs.</dc:description>

         <title>An N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization Strategy for Accessing Diverse N&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Azoles from Nitriles and 1,3&#8208;Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  &#8208;Trifluoromethyl azoles are valuable targets in medicinal chemistry. However, their historically challenging synthesis makes them inaccessible. Classical preparation of  N  &#8208;CF3  &#160;  azoles relies on the functional group interconversions but suffers from tedious  N  &#8208;pre&#8208;functionalization and unfriendly agents. Introduction of the CF3 onto the nitrogen of heterocycles provides a direct route to such motifs, but the  N  &#8208;trifluoromethylation remains underdeveloped. Reported here is an alternative and scalable cyclization strategy based on NCF3&#8208;containing synthons for constructing  N  &#8208;CF3 azoles. The approach involves the  N  &#8208;trifluoromethylation of nitriles followed by a [3+2] cyclization between resulting  N  &#8208;CF3  &#160;  nitrilium derivatives and 1,3&#8208;dipoles. PhICF3Cl was an effective CF3  &#160;  source for the transformation. As a result, a generic platform has been established for the first time to divergently synthesize  N  &#8208;trifluoromethylated tetrazoles, imidazoles, and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by using sodium azide, activated methylene isocyanides, and diazo compounds as dipoles, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The construction of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high single atom densities, favorable electronic structures and fast mass transfer is highly desired. Here, metal&#8208;triazolate (MET) frameworks, a subclass of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high N content, are utilized as precursors since they can enhance the density and regulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites as well as generate abundant mesopores simultaneously. Fe single atoms dispersed in hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix with high metal content (2.78 wt.%) and configuration of FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;&#160;(FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;/NC) as well as mesopores with proportion of 0.92 (pore&#8208;volume ration) were obtained via the pyrolysis of a Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic MET modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole. FeN&#8324;Cl&#8321;/NC exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations confirm Cl can optimize the adsorption free energy of Fe sites to *OH, thereby promoting the ORR process. Further, it demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This strategy may pave a new way for selecting, designing, and adjusting MOFs as precursors to build high&#8208;performance SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Supramolecular Cascaded Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Capturing System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of two&#8208;step sequential phosphorescence energy transfer system is a challenging task in aqueous environment. Herein, for the first time, we report an ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded phosphorescence&#8208;capturing aggregate based on multivalent co&#8208;assembly strategy utilizing cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and amphipathic sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD). The initial dibromophthalimide derivative (G) generated a weak phosphorescent emission at 505 nm by host&#8208;guest interaction with CB[7], which further assembled with SC4AD to form homogeneously spherical nanoparticles with the dramatical enhancement of both phosphorescence lifetime to 1.13 ms and emission intensity by 40&#8208;fold. Notably, such G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD aggregate exhibited efficient phosphoresce energy transfer to Rhodamine B (RhB) or benzothiadiazole (DBT) with high efficiency (&#1060;  ET  ) of 84.4&#160;% and 76.3&#160;% and antenna effect (AE) of 289.4 and 119.5, and then each of which can function as a bridge to further transfer their energy to second near&#8208;infrared acceptor Cy5 or Nile blue (NiB) to achieve the cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer (&#1060;  ET  : 54.0%, 60.5%, 58.9%, 74.1%; AE: 190.6, 97.0, 116.8, 46.2). The final aggregate with long&#8208;range effect from 425 nm to 800 nm and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence was further employed as imaging agent for multicolour cell labelling. This work provides a universal and feasible approach for the construction of cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer system in aqueous phase, which holds great promise in diverse fields including materials science and biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomistic Insights of Irreversible Li+ Intercalation in MnO2 Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tunnel&#8208;structured MnO  2  represents open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage. Its wide application is limited by the poor cycling stability, whose structural origin is unclear. Herein, targeting &#946;&#8208;MnO  2  , we tracked its structure evolution upon Li  +  ions insertion/extraction combining advanced  in situ  diagnostic tools at both electrode level (synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering) and single&#8208;particle level (transmission electron microscopy). The instability is found to originate from a partially reversible phase transition between &#946;&#8208;MnO  2  and orthorhombic LiMnO  2  upon lithiation, causing cycling capacity decay. Moreover, the MnO  2  /LiMnO  2  interface exhibits multiple arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, which severely chop into the host and undermine its structural integrity. Our findings could account for the cycling instability of tunnel&#8208;structured materials, based on which future strategies should focus on tuning the charge transport kinetics toward performance enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Equilibrium Growth of Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Frameworks&#8208;Graphene Oxide Hybrid Materials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile synthesis and post&#8208;processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mild synthetic conditions are extremely desired and important for wide utilizations in catalysis and energy storage. Here we report the synthesis of chemically stable aza&#8208;fused BPT&#8208;COF and newly PT&#8208;COF via a liquid phase method. The process is achieved by the spontaneous polycondensation between vicinal diamines and vicinal diketones, and is driven by the near&#8208;equilibrium growth of COF domains at a very low monomer concentration. The method permits in situ assembly of COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials, and forms uniform conducting film on arbitrary substrates via vacuum filtration. When used as electrocatalysts, the as&#8208;prepared membranes show a fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotential (45 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and small Tafel slope (53 mV dec  &#8211;1  ), which are the best among metal&#8208;free catalysts. Our results may open a new route towards preparation of highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs for multi&#8208;functional applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tuning the secondary structure of a protein or polymer in the solid&#8208;state is challenging. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of a pseudoprotein and its secondary structure tuning in the solid&#8208;state.&#160;We designed the dipeptide monomer N3&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ala&#8208;NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;C&#8801;CH (1) for&#160;topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Dipeptide&#160;1&#160;adopts an anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like stacked arrangement in its crystals. Upon heating, the dipeptide undergoes quantitative TAAC polymerization in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion yielding large polymers. The reaction occurs between the adjacent monomers in the H&#8208;bonded anti&#8208;parallel stack, yielding pseudoprotein having a &#946;&#8208;meander structure. When dissolved in methanol, this pseudoprotein changes its secondary structure from &#946;&#8208;meander to &#945;&#8208;helical form and it retains the new secondary structure upon desolvation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced On/Off Switching of the Surfactant Character of the o&#8208;Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Anion with No Covalent Bond Alteration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemistry reveals a photoinduced cisoid to transoid rotation in the o&#8208;cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;, driven by the larger stability of the transoid rotamer in the excited triplet state. The non&#8208;radiative decay, supported by non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics and the absence of signal in fluorescence mapping experiments, allow the thermal recovery of the dominant cisoid arrangement in water solution.







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;) is a well&#8208;known metallacarborane with multiple applications in a variety of fields. In aqueous solution, the cisoid rotamer is the most stable disposition in the ground state. The present work provides theoretical evidence on the possibility to photoinduce the rotation from the cisoid to the transoid rotamer, a conversion that can be reverted when the ground state is repopulated. The non&#8208;radiative decay mechanisms proposed in this work are coherent with the lack of fluorescence observed in 3D fluorescence mapping experiments performed on [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and its derivatives. This phenomenon induced by light has the potential to destruct the vesicles and micelles cisoid [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; typically forms in aqueous solution, which could lead to promising applications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.

&lt;p&gt;Quantum chemistry reveals a photoinduced &lt;i&gt;cisoid&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;transoid&lt;/i&gt; rotation in the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion [&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-COSAN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, driven by the larger stability of the &lt;i&gt;transoid&lt;/i&gt; rotamer in the excited triplet state. The non-radiative decay, supported by non-adiabatic molecular dynamics and the absence of signal in fluorescence mapping experiments, allow the thermal recovery of the dominant &lt;i&gt;cisoid&lt;/i&gt; arrangement in water solution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-COSAN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) is a well-known metallacarborane with multiple applications in a variety of fields. In aqueous solution, the &lt;i&gt;cisoid&lt;/i&gt; rotamer is the most stable disposition in the ground state. The present work provides theoretical evidence on the possibility to photoinduce the rotation from the &lt;i&gt;cisoid&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;transoid&lt;/i&gt; rotamer, a conversion that can be reverted when the ground state is repopulated. The non-radiative decay mechanisms proposed in this work are coherent with the lack of fluorescence observed in 3D fluorescence mapping experiments performed on [&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-COSAN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and its derivatives. This phenomenon induced by light has the potential to destruct the vesicles and micelles &lt;i&gt;cisoid&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-COSAN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; typically forms in aqueous solution, which could lead to promising applications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroallylation of Aryl Halides and Pseudo Halides with Difluoroallylboron Reagents in High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of a difluoroallylboronate with aryl and heteroaryl halides and triflates provides a convenient and broadly applicable synthesis of difluoroallylarenes. The difluoroallyl boron reagent is formed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of the inexpensive reagent 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene, and the products undergo a wide range of reactions to a series of difluoro&#8208;substituted analogs of common biologically valuable building blocks.







Abstract
We report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl halides and pseudo halides with 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronates in high yield with high regioselectivity, and we report the preparation of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronate reactants by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of inexpensive gaseous 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene with bis(pinacolato)diboron. The gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Pd]) and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, including primary alcohols, secondary amines, ethers, ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes, nitriles, halides, and nitro groups. This protocol extends to aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates, as well as substituted difluoroallyl boronates, providing a versatile synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl arenes that we show to be valuable intermediates to a series of fluorinated building blocks.

         <title>An Iridium Catalytic System Compatible with Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Sources for Dual Asymmetric Reductive Amination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) is one of the most promising methods for chiral amine synthesis. Herein we report our efforts on merging two ARA reactions into a single&#8208;step transformation. Catalyzed by the iridium and steric hindered phosphoramidite complex, the readily available and inexpensive aromatic ketones and ammonium acetate initially undergo the first ARA to afford primary amines, which serve as the amine sources for the second ARA, and finally provide the enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amine products. The developed process competently enables the successive coupling of both inorganic and organic nitrogen sources with ketones in the same reaction system. The Br&#248;nsted acid additive plays multiple roles in this procedure. It accelerates the formation of imine intermediates, minimizes the inhibitory effect from N&#8208;containing species on the iridium catalyst and reduces the primary amine side&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations Involving the Activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective functionalization of C(sp 3 )&#8722;H bonds using
transition metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations
of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom
economy, this type of reactions opens unconventional retrosynthetic
pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the
activation of intrinsically inert C(sp 3 )&#8722;H bonds, and the selection
among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In
recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues,
especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions
entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely,
the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using
metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp 3 )&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored.
Only recently, the number of reports on this type of annulations is
starting to grow. Herein we review some of the more relevant
advances in this exciting topic.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An athermal approach to mRNA enrichment from total RNA using a self&#8208;immolative thioester linked nucleic acids (TENA) is described. Oligo(thymine) (oT) TENA has a six&#8208;atom spacing between bases which allowed TENA to selectively base&#8208;pair with polyadenine RNA. As a result of the neutral backbone of TENA and the hydrophobicity of the octanethiol end group, oT TENA is water insoluble and efficiently pulled down 93 &#177; 2% of EGFP mRNA at a concentration of 10 ng/&#956;L. Self&#8208;immolative degradation of TENA upon ambient temperature exposure to nucleophilic buffer components (Tris, DTT) allowed recovery of 55 &#177; 27 ng of mRNA from 3.1 ug of total RNA, which was not statistically different from the amount recovered using Dynabeads&#174; mRNA DIRECT Kit (89 &#177; 24 ng). Gene expression as measured by RT&#8208;qPCR was comparable for both enrichment methods, suggesting that the mild conditions required for enrichment of mRNA using oT TENA are compatible with RT&#8208;qPCR and other downstream molecular biology applications.</dc:description>

Moreover, TP-DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53 cm  2  V  -1  s  -1  than films with N-DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP-DMBI, and 3,4,5-trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n-type organic thermoelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mediated Inner&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer Induces Homogeneous Reduction of CO2 via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic reduction of CO  2  is an appealing method for converting renewable energy sources into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. We report a co&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the reduction of CO  2  to CO comprised of a molecular Cr complex and dibenzothiophene&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (DBTD) as a redox mediator, which achieves high activity (TOF = 1.51&#8208;2.84 x 10  5  s  &#8211;1  ) and quantitative selectivity. Under aprotic or protic conditions, DBTD produces a co&#8208;electrocatalytic response with  1  by coordinating  trans  to the site of CO  2  binding and mediating electron transfer from the electrode with quantitative efficiency for CO. This assembly is reliant on through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between the  &#960;  frameworks of DBTD and the bpy fragment of the catalyst ligand, with contributions from dispersive interactions and weak sulfone coordination.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We&#160;report the first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then intercepted stereoselectively. The underlying radical mechanism of this process overcomes the poor regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity that traditionally affects the conjugate allylation of enals proceeding via polar pathways. We also demonstrate how this organocatalytic strategy could selectively install a valuable prenyl fragment at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of enals.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemically Synthesised Flexible Electrodes based on Bimetallic Metal&#8208;organic Framework Glasses for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The melting behaviour of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has aroused significant research interest in the areas of materials science, condensed matter physics and chemical engineering. This work first introduces a novel method to fabricate a bimetallic MOF glass, through melt&#8208;quenching of the cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) [ZIF&#8208;62(Co)] with an adsorbed ferric coordination complex. The high&#8208;temperature chemically reactive ZIF&#8208;62(Co) liquid facilitates the formation of coordinative bonds between Fe and imidazolate ligands, incorporating Fe nodes into the framework after quenching. The resultant Co&#8208;Fe bimetallic MOF glass therefore shows a significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance. The novel bimetallic MOF glass, when combined with the facile and scalable mechanochemical synthesis technique for both discrete powders and surface coatings on flexible substrates, enables significant opportunities for catalytic device assembly.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective endosomal escape after cellular uptake represents a major challenge in the field of nanodelivery, as the majority of drug payloads must localize to subcellular compartments other than the endosomes in order to exert activity. In nature, viruses can readily deliver their genetic material to the cytosol of host cells by triggering membrane fusion after endocytosis. For the influenza A virus, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein found on its surface fuses the viral envelope with surrounding membrane at endosomal pH values. Here, biomimetic nanoparticles capable of endosomal escape were fabricated using a membrane coating derived from cells engineered to express HA on their surface. When evaluated in vitro, these virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles were able to deliver an mRNA payload to the cytosolic compartment of target cells, resulting in the successful expression of the encoded protein. When the mRNA&#8208;loaded nanoparticles were administered in vivo, protein expression levels were significantly increased in both local and systemic delivery scenarios. We therefore conclude that utilizing genetic engineering approaches to express viral fusion proteins on the surface of cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles is a viable strategy for modulating the intracellular localization of encapsulated cargoes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8211;Oxygen bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed at room temperature. This is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.







Abstract
In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8211;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiHx material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO2 methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiHx has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8211;oxygen bond activation than the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.

&lt;/sub&gt; has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8211;oxygen bond activation than the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Interfacial Layer for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;ring polymer with a high stiffness, high toughness and excellent fracture resistance is designed to adapt its shape to dynamic electrode volume variations and stabilize the lithium anode upon cycling.







Abstract
The plating/stripping of Li dendrites can fracture the static solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cause significant dynamic volume variations in the Li anode, which give rise to poor cyclability and severe safety hazards. Herein, a tough polymer with a slide&#8208;ring structure was designed as a self&#8208;adaptive interfacial layer for Li anodes. The slide&#8208;ring polymer with a dynamically crosslinked network moves freely while maintaining its toughness and fracture resistance, which allows it can to dissipate the tension induced by Li dendrites on the interphase layer. Moreover, the slide&#8208;ring polymer is highly stretchable, elastic, and displays an ultrafast self&#8208;healing ability, which allows even pulverized Li to remain coalesced without disintegrating upon consecutive cycling. The Li anodes demonstrate greatly improved suppression of Li dendrite formation, as evidenced by the high critical current density (6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable cycling for the full cells with high&#8208;areal capacity LiFePO4, high&#8208;voltage NCM, and S cathodes.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Reduction via Integrated Construction and Synergistic Catalysis of Porous Platinum Alloy and Defective Graphitic Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous platinum&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon results in improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance as a result of the interaction between the ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C units.







Abstract
Integrated fabrication through the strong interaction between catalyst and carrier is crucial to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis for fuel cells. We report herein a porous Pt&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon via integration engineering, where a synergistic catalysis between ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C results in the optimized reaction pathway and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The hybrid catalyst PtCuCo@Co&#8208;N&#8208;C delivers a mass activity of 1.14&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the full&#8208;cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 780&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti&#8208;corrosion capabilities and improving the ORR performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>1,6&#8208;Anthrazoline&#8208;Linked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles and Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Friedl&#228;nder Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An old chemistry, but a new efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and 2D polymer! We demonstrated that Friedl&#228;nder synthesis which involves both dynamic imine condensation and aldol condensation is highly effective for the synthesis of kinetically stable, 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline&#8208;based all sp2 C/N containing macrocycles and crystalline 2D polymer.







Abstract
Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodology. Herein, we report the preparation of a 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline (AZ)&#8208;linked crystalline 2D polymer AZP via acid mediated Friedl&#228;nder synthesis. The feasibility was examined first by two model reactions, followed by synthesis of three AZ&#8208;based macrocycles MCn (n=5&#8211;7), in which hexagonal MC6 was isolated as the major product. The favorable macrocycle formation could be largely attributed to the dynamic feature of Friedl&#228;nder synthesis, which involves both imine condensation and aldol condensation. The structure and crystallinity of AZP were confirmed by experiments and simulation. The skeletons of the macrocycles and polymer consist of all&#8208;sp2 hybridized C/N atoms and are thus &#960;&#8208;conjugated and electro&#8208;active. Our studies provide a rational way to access kinetically stable 2D crystalline polymers by combination of different dynamic covalent chemistries.

         <title>Plenty of Room at the Top: A Multi&#8208;Scale Understanding of nm&#8208;Resolution Polymer Patterning on 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striped phase polydiacetylenes create 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution chemical patterns on 2D materials, well below the limits possible through most fabrication methods. A new multi&#8208;scale view of polymerization enables the design of monomers that undergo efficient on&#8208;surface polymerization, opening the door to new applications that rely on stable, near&#8208;atomic&#8208;scale chemical environments.







Abstract
Lamellar phases of alkyldiacetylenes in which the alkyl chains lie parallel to the substrate represent a straightforward means for scalable 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution interfacial patterning. This capability has the potential for substantial impacts in nanoscale electronics, energy conversion, and biomaterials design. Polymerization is required to set the 1&#8208;nm functional patterns embedded in the monolayer, making it important to understand structure&#8211;function relationships for these on&#8208;surface reactions. Polymerization can be observed for certain monomers at the single&#8208;polymer scale using scanning probe microscopy. However, substantial restrictions on the systems that can be effectively characterized have limited utility. Here, using a new multi&#8208;scale approach, we identify a large, previously unreported difference in polymerization efficiency between the two most widely used commercial diynoic acids. We further identify a core design principle for maximizing polymerization efficiency in these on&#8208;surface reactions, generating a new monomer that also exhibits enhanced polymerization efficiency.

         <title>Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening of Aryl Cyclopropanes to 1&#8208;Aroyloxylated&#8208;3&#8208;Acylated Alkanes</title>

Ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation of mono, di and trisubstituted cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;aroyloxy ketones is reported. Key step is the radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle and a ketyl radical formed in the NHC catalysis cycle.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.

         <title>Overcoming the Low Driving Force in Forming Depolymerizable Polymers through Monomer Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of fused&#8208;ring cyclooctene monomers substantially elevates the driving force in forming depolymerizable polymers, enabling living polymerization and block copolymer synthesis at initial monomer concentration &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. The sequence of isomerization&#8208;polymerization&#8208;depolymerization forms a unique closed&#8208;loop that can be exploited for developing chemically recyclable polymers.







Abstract
While depolymerizable polymers have been intensely pursued as a potential solution to address the challenges in polymer sustainability, most depolymerization systems are characterized by a low driving force in polymerization, which poses difficulties for accessing diverse functionalities and architectures of polymers. Here, we address this challenge by using a cyclooctene&#8208;based depolymerization system, in which the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans alkene isomerization significantly increases the ring strain energy to enable living ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at monomer concentrations &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. An additional trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused at the 5,6&#8208;position of the cyclooctene reduces the ring strain energy of cyclooctene, enabling the corresponding polymers to depolymerize into the cis&#8208;cyclooctene monomers. The use of excess triphenylphosphine was found to be essential to suppress secondary metathesis and depolymerization. The high&#8208;driving&#8208;force living polymerization of the trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused trans&#8208;cyclooctene system holds promise for developing chemically recyclable polymers of a wide variety of polymer architectures.

         <title>Orchestrating Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide Signaling Molecules for Synergistic Treatment of MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local delivery of gaseous signaling molecules (GSMs) has shown promising therapeutic potentials. However, although GSMs have a subtle interplay in physiological and pathological conditions, the co&#8208;delivery of different GSMs for therapeutic purposes remains unexplored. Herein, we covalently graft a nitric oxide (NO)releasing  N  &#8208;nitrosamine moiety onto the carbon monoxide (CO)releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (3&#8208;HF) antenna, resulting in the first NO/CO&#8208;releasing donor. Under visible light irradiation, photomediated co&#8208;release of NO and CO reveals a superior antimicrobial effect toward Gram&#8208;positive bacteria with a synergistic combination index of 0.053. The synergy of NO and CO hyperpolarizes and permeabilizes bacterial membranes, which, however, shows negligible hemolysis and no evident toxicity toward normal mammalian cells. Moreover, the co&#8208;release of NO and CO can efficiently treat MRSA infection in a murine skin wound model, showing a better therapeutic capacity than vancomycin.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacked Reticular Frame Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is intriguing as advanced chiroptical materials but never reported so far. Herein, we constructed chiroptical COF materials with CPL activity through the convenient Knoevenagel condensation of formyl&#8208;functionalized axially chiral linkers and C3&#8208;symmetric 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriacetonitrile. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared chiral COFs showed high absorption and luminescent dissymmetric factors up to 0.02 (gabs) and 0.04 (glum), respectively. In contrast, the branched chiral polymers from the same starting monomers were CPL silent. The structural and spectral characterizations revealed that the reticular frame was indispensable for CPL generation via confined chirality transfer. Moreover, the reticular stacking was found to significantly boost the CPL performance due to the interlayer restriction of frame. This work demonstrated not only the first example of CPL active COF but also provided the insightful understanding of CPL generation through covalent reticular chemistry, which will play a constructive role in the future design of high&#8208;performance CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report carbene insertion into Si&#8208;H bonds of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) for the synthesis of highly functionalized siloxane nanomaterials. Dirhodium(II) carboxylates catalyze insertion of aryl&#8208;diazoacetates as carbene precursors to afford POSS structures containing both ester and aryl groups as orthogonal functional handles for further derivatization of POSS materials. Four diverse and structurally varied silsesquioxane core scaffolds with one, three, or eight Si&#8208;H bonds were evaluated with diazo reactants to produce a total of 20 new POSS compounds. Novel diazo compounds containing a fluorinated octyl group and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore demonstrate the use of highly functionalized substrates. Transformations of aryl(ester)&#8208;functionalized POSS compounds derived from this method are demonstrated, including ester hydrolysis and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

Novel diazo compounds containing a fluorinated octyl group and boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore demonstrate the use of highly functionalized substrates. Transformations of aryl(ester)-functionalized POSS compounds derived from this method are demonstrated, including ester hydrolysis and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metathesis by partner interchange in &#963;&#8208;bond ligands: expanding applications of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 2007 two of us defined the &#963;&#8208;Complex Assisted Metathesis mechanism (Perutz and Sabo&#8208;Etienne,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  2007  ,  46  , 2578&#8208;2592),  i.e.  the &#963;&#8208;CAM concept. This new approach to reaction mechanisms brought together metathesis reactions involving the formation of a variety of metal&#8208;element bonds through partner&#8208;interchange of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes. The key concept that defines a &#963;&#8208;CAM process is a  single  transition state for metathesis that is connected by two intermediates that are &#963;&#8208;bond complexes while the oxidation state of the metal remains constant in precursor, intermediates and product. This mechanism is appropriate in situations where &#963;&#8208;bond complexes have been isolated or computed as well&#8208;defined minima. Unlike several other mechanisms, it does not define the nature of the transition state. In this review, we highlight advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence. We then draw on these examples to demonstrate that the scope of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism has expanded to classes of reaction not envisaged in 2007 (additional s&#8208;bond ligands, agostic complexes, sp  2  &#8208;carbon, surfaces). Finally, we provide a critical comparison to alternative mechanisms for metathesis of metal&#8208;element bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Nitrogen Superbases: Using Light for Reversible Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as an external stimulus to alter the reactivity of Lewis bases is an intriguing tool for controlling chemical reactions. Reversible photoreactions associated with pronounced reactivity changes are particularly valuable in this regard. We herein report the first photoswitchable nitrogen superbases based on guanidines equipped with a dithienylethene photochromic unit. The resulting N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) undergo reversible, near quantitative electrocyclic isomerization upon successive exposure to UV and visible irradiation, as demonstrated over multiple cycles. Switching between the ring&#8208;opened and ring&#8208;closed states is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of the NHIs by up to 8.7 units. Since only the ring&#8208;closed isomers are sufficiently basic to activate CO2 via the formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts, cycling between the two isomeric states enables the light&#8208;controlled capture and release of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the regioisomeric space and visible color range of purely organic dual emitters with ultralong phosphorescence components: From violet to red towards pure white&#8208;light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence over the whole visible spectrum towards white light emission based on purely organic dual emitters has not been reported yet. In this contribution, we mapped the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum (from violet to red) and even achieved white light emission (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) by combining the intrinsic ns&#8208;fluorescence with ultralong ms&#8208;phosphorescence from purely organic dual emitters. Hence, we realized small molecular materials showing high photoluminescence quantum yields in the solid state at room temperature, which was achieved by active exploration of the regioisomeric substitution space. Chromophore stacking&#8208;supported stabilization of triplet excitons with assistance from enhanced intersystem crossing channels in the neat crystalline state was found to play the primary role for the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. The present study includes two main advancements: firstly, it provides an easy strategy to cover the entire visible spectrum, based on organic phosphorescent emitters with versatile regioisomeric substitution patterns. Secondly, this study provides a single molecular source of white light with a strikingly long lifetime (up to 163.5 ms) for the phosphorescent component, as well as remarkably high overall photoluminescence quantum yields reaching up to &#934; L = 20%. Such features have been rarely reported for purely organic compounds and provide a crucial platform to design the next generation of sustainable luminophores with advanced applications spanning from multimodal bioimaging and sensing to advanced optoelectronics, without the need for scarce elements such as Ru, Os, Rh, Ir, Pd or Pt.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacked but not Stuck: Unveiling the Role of &#960; &#8594; &#960;* Interactions with the Help of the Benzofuran&#8208;Formaldehyde Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1:1 benzofuran&#8208;formaldehyde complex has been chosen as model system for analyzing  &#960;  &#8594;  &#960;  * interactions in supramolecular organizations involving heteroaromatic rings and carbonyl groups. A joint &#8220;rotational spectroscopy &#8208; quantum chemistry&#8221; strategy unveiled the dominant role of  &#960;  &#8594;  &#960;  * interactions in tuning the intermolecular interactions of such adduct. The exploration of the intermolecular potential energy surface led to the identification of 14 low&#8208;energy minima, with 4 stacked isomers being more stable than those linked by hydrogen bond or lone&#8208;pair&#8594;  &#960;  interactions. All energy minima are separated by loose transition states, thus suggesting an effective relaxation to the global minimum under the experimental conditions. This expectation has been confirmed by the experimental detection of only one species, which was unambiguously assigned owing to the computation of accurate spectroscopic parameters and the characterization of 11 isotopologues. The large number of isotopic species opened the way to the determination of the first semi&#8208;experimental equilibrium structure for a molecular complex of such a dimension.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C&#8722;Ge Coupling of Aryl/Alkenyl Electrophiles with Chlorogermanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling has emerged as a promising tool for molecular synthesis; however, current studies have focused mainly on forging the C&#8211;C bonds. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8211;Ge coupling reaction and thereby demonstrate the possibility of constructing organogermanes from carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers access to both aryl and alkenyl germanes. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled well. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of the &#8211;GeR  3  moiety into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organogermanes are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of a Macrobicyclic Olefin bearing a Sacrificial Silyloxide Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has been regarded as a powerful tool for sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization. However, the traditional entropy&#8208;driven ROMP of macrocyclic olefins suffers from the lack of ring strain and poor regio&#8208;selectivity, whereas the relay&#8208;ring closing metathesis polymerization inevitably brings some unnecessary auxiliary structure into each monomeric unit.

Zr and Hf use their valence d orbitals to form bonds with the layers, leading to nearly identical band structures. Like MgB2, ZrBe2 and HfBe2 are computed to be phonon&#8208;mediated superconductors at ambient pressures, with respective critical temperatures of 11.4 K and 8.8 K. The coupling strength between phonons and free electrons is very similar, so that the difference in critical temperatures is controlled by the mass of constituent interlayer ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous microporous membranes are widely studied for gas separation, due to their low energy premium and strong molecular specificity. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with their exceptional stability and structural flexibility are suited to a wide range of separations. Main&#8208;stream PAF&#8208;based membranes are usually prepared with polymeric matrices, but their discrete entities and boundary defects weaken their selectivity and permeability. The synthesis of continuous PAF membranes is still a major challenge because PAFs are insoluble. Herein, we successfully synthesized a continuous PAF membrane for gas separation. Both pore size and chemistry of the PAF membrane were modified by ion&#8208;exchange, resulting in good selectivity and permeance for the gas mixtures H  2  /N  2  and CO  2  /N  2  . The membrane with Br  &#8208;  as a counter ion in the framework exhibited a H  2  /N  2  selectivity of 72.7 with a H  2  permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). When the counter ions were replaced by BF  4  &#8208;  , the membrane showed a CO  2  permeance of 23058 GPU, and an optimized CO  2  /N  2  selectivity of 60.0. Our results show that continuous PAF membranes with modifiable pores are promising for various gas separation situations.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Dependent Ordering Transition of Highly Crystalline Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When switching the alky linkers from C12H24 to C16H32 in double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers, perylene bisimide side units exhibited order phase transition from disordered structures to ordered H&#8208;aggregation, which is strongly correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.







Abstract
We developed a series of highly crystalline double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. For double&#8208;cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion, resulting in large d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 64&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H&#8208;aggregation, resulting in short d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 50&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker). This work highlights the importance of linker length on the molecular packing of the acceptor units and the influences on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.

         <title>Stepwise Generation of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Triply&#8208;Reduced Warped Nanographenes: Charge&#8208;Dependent Aromaticity, Surface Nonequivalence, Swing Distortion, and Metal Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG, 1) with Cs metal affords the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triply&#8208;reduced nanosized carbanions. In&#8208;depth X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and comprehensive theoretical investigations of this series of negatively charged nanographenes reveal a very complex response and core flexibility upon multi&#8208;electron charging.







Abstract
The stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved &#960;&#8208;surface and defined C80H30 composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs+ ions is confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of the WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted &#960;&#8208;surface of the WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting carbanions.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;strain phosphate cathode material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (KVP) nanorulers is synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach. The KVP nanorulers manifest high discharge voltage, superior rate capability, and ultralong cyclic life as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). This work would provide guidance to exploit high&#8208;performance PIB cathode materials.







Abstract
Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. We report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 80.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a large average working potential of 4.11&#8197;V. It also manifests an excellent rate property of 54.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity preservation of 92.1&#8201;% over 2500&#8197;cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from a low&#8208;strain K+ uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K+ migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs.

         <title>Reactions of a Dilithiomethane with CO and N2O: An Avenue to an Anionic Ketene and a Hexafunctionalized Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dianion [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO affording C&#8722;C bond formation and Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment migration. Subsequent reaction with N2O cleaves a P&#8722;C bond generating an anionic ketene&#8208;derivative which cyclotrimerizes to give the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative, [Ph2P(S)COLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. The experimental observations are rationalized by a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT methods.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the lithium complex [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO lead to C&#8722;C bond formation and migration of a Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N2O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond affording [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 4 and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 5. Heating 5 prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of 13C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.

         <title>Block Copolymers Based on Ethylene and Methacrylates Using a Combination of Catalytic Chain Transfer Polymerisation (CCTP) and Radical Polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic chain transfer polymerisation was used to produce methacrylic macromonomers. Those were involved in a simple radical polymerisation of ethylene to form block copolymers featuring a polyethylene segment and various polymethacrylic segments.







Abstract
Two scalable polymerisation methods are used in combination for the synthesis of ethylene and methacrylate block copolymers. &#969;&#8208;Unsaturated methacrylic oligomers (MMAn) produced by catalytic chain transfer (co)polymerisation (CCTP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as reagents in the radical polymerisation of ethylene (E) in dimethyl carbonate solvent under relatively mild conditions (80&#8197;bar, 70&#8201;&#176;C). Kinetic measurements and analyses of the produced copolymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques indicate that MMAn is involved in a degradative chain transfer process resulting in the formation of (MMA)n&#8208;b&#8208;PE block copolymers. Molecular modelling performed by DFT supports the overall reactivity scheme and observed selectivities. The effect of MMAn molar mass and composition is also studied. The block copolymers were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their bulk behaviour studied by SAXS/WAXS analysis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Selective Photolysis of Phosphonium Iodide Salts for Monofluoromethylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective synthesis of fluoromethylated alkenes, heterocycles, enamines and heteroarenes by using the readily available and bench&#8208;stable fluoromethylphosphonium iodide salts is described. Key to this privileged transformation is the formation of a photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the &#963;&#8208;hole effect of phosphonium salts.







Abstract
The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radicals is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Fluoromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of the &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge&#8208;transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation of a variety of alkenes.

         <title>Elimination of Grain Boundary Defects in Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework ZIF&#8208;95 Membrane via Solvent&#8208;Free Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is developed for facile synthesis of highly oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membranes. The solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also reduce solvent&#8208;induced intercrystalline defects, leading to a significant enhancement of the H2 permselectivity for the separation of hydrogen from larger gas molecules compared to solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are usually prepared by in situ or secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel. The use of organic solvents may cause safety and environmental problems and produce solvent&#8208;induced defects. Here, highly oriented and permselective ZIF&#8208;95 membranes are prepared for the first time via a solvent&#8208;free secondary growth method. The solvent&#8208;free growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also to reduce the intercrystalline defects. In case of solvent&#8208;free growth, a perfectly oriented structure leads to an outstanding reduction of intercrystalline defects and transport resistances. For the separation of equimolar binary gas mixtures by using the highly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 are 184 and 140, respectively, with H2 permeance of over 1.9&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 which are much higher than those of the randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.

The solvent-free secondary growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also reduce solvent-induced intercrystalline defects, leading to a significant enhancement of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permselectivity for the separation of hydrogen from larger gas molecules compared to solvothermal synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are usually prepared by in situ or secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel. The use of organic solvents may cause safety and environmental problems and produce solvent-induced defects. Here, highly oriented and permselective ZIF-95 membranes are prepared for the first time via a solvent-free secondary growth method. The solvent-free growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also to reduce the intercrystalline defects. In case of solvent-free growth, a perfectly oriented structure leads to an outstanding reduction of intercrystalline defects and transport resistances. For the separation of equimolar binary gas mixtures by using the highly oriented ZIF-95 membrane at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, the mixture separation factors of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are 184 and 140, respectively, with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of over 1.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; which are much higher than those of the randomly oriented ZIF-95 membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: A Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive T&#8208;type photoswitches with negative photochromism are rare and interesting candidates for a wide range of applications. Here, we describe the computer&#8208;assisted rational design of phenylimino indolinone (PIO) and its characterization in the ground and excited state using the full toolbox of physical organic chemistry.







Abstract
Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low&#8208;energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed phenylimino indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light&#8208;addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch showing negative photochromism. The isomerization behavior of this photoactuator of the iminothioindoxyl (ITI) class was studied using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies on time scales from femtoseconds to the steady state and by quantum&#8208;chemical analyses. The understanding of the isomerization properties and substituent effects governing these photoswitches opens new avenues for the development of novel T&#8208;type visible&#8208;light&#8208;addressable photoactuators based on C=N bonds.

         <title>Desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl sulfonyl fluorides, typically inert to transition metal catalysis, undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. The reaction can occur without added base and turns the &#8722;SO2F group into a divergent handle for C&#8722;C or S&#8722;Nu coupling.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are relatively inert towards C&#8722;C bond forming transformations, notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8722;Nu and C&#8722;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8722;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive Antimony(I) Cation and Its Coordination Complexes with Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive SbI cation has been stabilized by the 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene ligand (see structure). The bis(phosphine) not only acts as a supporting ligand, but also enables the unique two&#8208;electron reduction of the SbIII precursor in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate, leading to SbI cation. The strategically introduced nucleophilicity at the SbI site enabled the first examples of its coordination to transition metals.







Abstract
Upon stabilization by 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene to form compound 1, the fugitive antimony (I) cation exhibited nucleophilic behavior towards coinage metals. Compound 1 was strategically synthesized at room temperature from SbCl3, the bis(phosphine), and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate taken in a 1:2:3 ratio, whereby the bis(phosphine) plays the dual role of a reductant and a supporting ligand. The generation of 1 involves two&#8208;electron oxidation of the ligand to form a P&#8722;P bonded diphosphonium dication. Compound 1 was separated from this dication to give both products in pure form in moderate yields. Despite the overall positive charge, the SbI site in 1 was found to bind to metal centers, forming complexes with AuI, AgI and CuI. Compound 1 reduced CuII to CuI and formed a coordination complex with the resulting CuI species. The effects of the electron&#8208;rich bis(phosphine) and the constrained peri geometry in stabilizing and enhancing the nucleophilicity of 1 have been rationalized through computational studies.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho&#8208;Cyanamide Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the step&#8208;wise synthesis of the novel cyapho&#8208;cyanamide ion, [N(CN)(CP)]&#8722;, obtained by the reaction of sodium phosphanide, Na(PH2), with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). Preliminary reactions of the ion with electrophiles reveal the cyclisation reactions are available on functionalisation.







Abstract
We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the N&#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]&#8722;. Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the phase transitions from cubic to reverse hexagonal phase in lipidic mesophase at molecular level. The dynamics of both water and lipids, as well as the hydrogen bond network of confined water were monitored during the phase transition. The results demonstrate clear dynamical difference between bound and interstitial water in both phases.







Abstract
We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (
) to double diamond (
) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and HII phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to bound and interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid's polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the headgroup of lipids in the HII phase at higher temperature than in the cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the number of H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.

         <title>Deciphering and Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidized Nitrogen in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of the nitrogen network during the nickel&#8208;catalyzed urea oxidation reaction was carefully performed. It revealed a dominant NO2&#8722; production rather than innocuous N2 present on various nickel&#8208;based catalysts. Accordingly, polymer&#8208;surface modification was put forward to increase the efficiency of harmless N2 products.







Abstract
Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2 production and nitrogen suppression in the process of water being used for energy production. Its sustainability is currently founded on innocuous N2 products; however, we discovered that prevalent nickel&#8208;based catalysts could generally over&#8208;oxidize urea into NO2&#8722; products with &#8776;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazards to the environment. Trace amounts of over&#8208;oxidized NO3&#8722; and N2O were also detected. Using 15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen&#8208;fate network involving a NO2&#8722;&#8208;formation pathway via OH&#8722;&#8208;assisted C&#8722;N cleavage and two N2&#8208;formation pathways via intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling. DFT calculations confirmed that C&#8722;N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline&#8208;coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for increasing N2 production by a factor of two. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water&#8211;energy nexus systems.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Fluorescent Polymeric Particles with Tunable White Light Emission Based on Aggregation Microenvironment Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particle were (CS&#8208;FPPs) constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation (2SP) polymerization, and white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs was achieved with the CIE1931 coordinate of (0.33, 0.34), which could be simply but effectively tuned by manipulating the aggregation microenvironment of the AIEgens located.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emitting polymers (WLEPs) based on aggregation microenvironment&#8208;sensitive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have aroused great interest in lighting and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we developed a novel strategy to construct WLEP particles via a stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation polymerization of two emission&#8208;complementary AIEgens under core&#8211;shell engineering, where the AIE characteristics and FRET process of core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) could be modulated by altering aggregation microenvironment under swelling and shrinking of polymers, facilitating the tunable white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs. Furthermore, such tuning could be fast realized in the solid state, thus demonstrating the potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work proved the significance of aggregation microenvironment on emission of luminogens, guiding the development of high&#8208;efficiency emission&#8208;tunable materials.

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tridecasaccharide glycan domain of lipooligosaccharides from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii was synthesized. The target (see structure) possesses structural motifs that make its synthesis a formidable challenge, including rare monosaccharides, an asymmetrically substituted trehalose residue and a base&#8208;sensitive amide side chain. The study provides a strategy for synthesizing other members of this unusual class of molecules.







Abstract
The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly and is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations.

A single&#8208;phase Rh2O3 nanocatalyst is developed by exploiting the stabilization of the (110) plane of the Rh2O3(I) seed on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) after decomposition of the rhodium precursor. By using the Rh/h&#8208;BN, catalytic methane partial oxidation to syngas was accomplished solely via the direct route.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8208;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8208;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to the nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8208;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed planes on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping a H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Iron Spin&#8208;State Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts is studied from Fe spin&#8208;state tuning. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra monitoring further supported the low&#8208;spin (LS) single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of the C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for the ORR.







Abstract
Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe1&#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin&#8208;state&#8208;determined ORR.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Dicationic Diazahexabenzocoronene Derivative on the Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice is prepared by on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic nanographene.







Abstract
The atomically precise control over the size, shape and structure of nanographenes (NGs) or the introduction of heteroatom dopants into their sp2&#8208;carbon lattice confer them valuable electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice, achieved via on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic NG. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements reveal a considerable variation of the local contact potential difference toward lower values with respect to the gold surface, indicative of its positive net charge. Altogether, we introduce the concept of cationic nitrogen doping of NGs on surfaces, opening new avenues for the design of novel carbon nanostructures.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Red Laser with a Single Longitudinal Mode from Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with high PLQY (65.5&#8201;%) were obtained by aliphatic precursors which combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) peak, was constructed and resulted in a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB.







Abstract
Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5&#8201;% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB (Q&#8764;4600). Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals is obtained in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical cholesteric superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch, which derives from the different conversion ratio of Z/E photoisomerization of the switch upon different light irradiations.







Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 1 and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 2, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch 2, exposure of the system incorporating switch 1 to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch 1.

&lt;p&gt;Two light-driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-switch &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-switch &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, are prepared by means of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H-bond acceptor and an opposite (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) chiral molecule as an H-bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, exposure of the system incorporating switch &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching-off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metallofulleroids were generated from a new isocyanide&#8208;induced multicomponent reaction on clusterfullerenes. One ketenimine metallofulleroid has fixed Lu3N cluster due to the presence of the nearby organic appendant from a neighbor molecule in the solid state.







Abstract
New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu3N@C80 yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu3N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Smart Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles Provide On&#8208;Demand Photosensitizer Synthesis and Hypoxia Relief for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2: HAL and 3BP&#8208;loaded microparticles specifically target and recognize tumor cells, wherein HAL induces the biosynthesis of PpIX in mitochondria and 3BP reduces the mitochondria oxygen consumption. The precise co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2 produces sufficient singlet oxygen to directly disrupt mitochondria, significantly improving PDT.







Abstract
Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) near to mitochondria can conquer the rigorous spatiotemporal limitations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. We simultaneously encapsulated hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria via the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway. Meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Modular and Asymmetric Baskets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of custom&#8208;built A, B, and C building blocks gives ABC baskets. Such enantioselective and modular construction allows choosing dept and shape of the cavitand's nonpolar pocket while also selecting desired functional groups at the rim. Building more effective mimics of biological receptors and catalysts is within reach.







Abstract
The precise positioning of functional groups about the inner space of abiotic hosts is a challenging task and of interest for developing more effective receptors and catalysts akin to those found in nature. To address it, we herein report a synthetic methodology for preparing basket&#8208;like cavitands comprised of three different aromatics as side arms with orthogonal esters at the rim for further functionalization. First, enantioenriched A (borochloronorbornene), B (iodobromonorbornene), and C (boronorbornene) building blocks were obtained by stereoselective syntheses. Second, consecutive A&#8208;to&#8208;B and then AB&#8208;to&#8208;C Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura (SM) couplings were optimized to give enantioenriched ABC cavitand as the principal product. The robust synthetic protocol allowed us to prepare (a)&#8197;an enantioenriched basket with three benzene sides and each holding either tBu, Et, or Me esters, (b)&#8197;both enantiomers of a so&#8208;called &#8220;spiral staircase&#8221; basket with benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups surrounding the inner space, and (c)&#8197;a photo&#8208;responsive basket bearing one anthracene and two benzene arms.

         <title>Studying the Conversion Mechanism to Broaden Cathode Options in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in CuI cathodes were studied. This direct conversion mechanism can be generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality, which enriches the Zn2+ storage mechanism and broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn2+ storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn2+ intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn2+ intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;vinyloxiranes with the challenging nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters) was achieved. It was successfully applied to the stereodivergent synthesis of structurally rigid spirocyclic framework. A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner.







Abstract
The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Copper/Cobalt Hybrids via Lewis Acidic Molten Salts Etching for High Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids were fabricated through molten salt etching for illustrating their interactions. The pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu were demonstrated. A symmetric supercapacitor based on Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode delivered a high energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1.0&#8197;M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, areal capacitance of 290.5&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at power density of 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, all isomers showed bright phosphorescence with an efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA scintillators showed bright luminescence under X&#8208;ray irradiation, which was ascribed to both excellent electrical conductivity and efficient suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while o&#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.

         <title>Chiral Recognition on Bare Gold Surfaces by Quartz Crystal Microbalance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) system, a bare gold surface which has chiral phases was shown to prefer the adsorption of D&#8208;type amino acid without relying on the organic selector layer on the surface.







Abstract
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is one of the powerful tools for the studies of molecular recognition and chiral discrimination. Its efficiency mainly relies on the design of the functional sensitive layer on the electrode surface. However, the organic sensitive layer may easily cause dissipation of oscillation or detachment and weaken the signal transfer during the molecular recognition processes. In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D&#8208;enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D&#8208;amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO2, NO, and N2O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin RhI&#8211;PtII bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides NO2, NO, and N2O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21st century. A bimetallic RhI&#8211;PtII complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to water and N2 was recorded, making these RhI&#8211;PtII complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NOx were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO2 proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H2O, followed by the generation of N2O and H2O, which is then further converted to N2 and H2O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond&#8208;forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N2O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.

     alt="Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond-forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nitrogen oxides NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. A bimetallic Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to water and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was recorded, making these Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, followed by the generation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is then further converted to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond-forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrahedral [Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; Occurring in Multimetallic Cluster Syntheses: About the Structure&#8208;Directing Role of Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; formed in a reaction of (Sn2Sb2)2&#8722; with [AuMePPh3] that affords multimetallic clusters for other reactant ratios. A central Sb atom bridges four free&#8208;standing {AuMe} units, which is unprecedented for main group metal complexes. Comprehensive DFT investigations explained the stability of the tetrahedral structure relative to a pyramidal one found in related molecules and shed light on the reaction space of said multimetallic species.







Abstract
The anion of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[Sb(AuMe)4]&#8901;py (1; crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py=pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p&#8208;block metal atom being surrounded by four free&#8208;standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions. By a combined experimental and theoretical study of different reaction conditions and previously unidentified side&#8208;products, we provide insight into multimetallic cluster synthesis reactions.

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters</title>

Simple methylation at the 4&#8208;position of a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enables direct observation by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy of the previously elusive bridging dioxacarbenium ion, supporting the hypothesis that distal group participation by secondary esters is disfavored by the conformation of the ester.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above &#8776;&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary ester, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.
