      <title>Disulfide&#8208;linked allosteric modulators for multi&#8208;cycle kinetic control of DNA&#8208;based nanodevices</title>
      <dc:description>Nature employs sulfur switches, i.e. redox&#8208;active disulfides, to kinetically control biological pathways in a highly efficient and reversible way. Inspired by this mechanism we describe here a DNA&#8208;based synthetic nanodevice that acts as a sulfur switch and can be temporally controlled though redox regulation. To do this we rationally designed disulfide DNA strands (modulators) that hybridize to a ligand&#8208;binding DNA nanodevice and act as redox&#8208;active allosteric regulators inducing the nanodevice to release or load its ligand. Upon reduction, the allosteric modulator spontaneously de&#8208;hybridizes from the nanodevice and, as a result, its effect is transient. The system is reversible and has an unprecedented high tolerance to waste products and displays transient behavior for over 40 cycles without significant loss of efficiency. Kinetic control of DNA&#8208;based ligand&#8208;binding nanodevices through purely chemical reactions paves the way for temporal regulation of more complex chemical pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Zeolite&#8208;Encaged Pd&#8208;Mn Nanocatalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation and Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage energy cycle is a promising way to implement the hydrogen economy, but the exploration of efficient catalysts to achieve this process remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer Pd&#8208;Mn clusters were encaged within silicalite&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolites by a ligand&#8208;protected method under direct hydrothermal conditions. The obtained zeolite&#8208;encaged metallic nanocatalysts exhibited extraordinary catalytic activity and durability in both CO2 hydrogenation into formate and formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation back to CO2 and hydrogen. Thanks to the formation of ultrasmall metal clusters and the synergic effect of bi&#8208;metallic components, the PdMn0.6@S&#8208;1 catalyst afforded a formate generation rate of 2151 molformate molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 353 K, and an initial turnover frequency of 6860 molH2 molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for CO&#8208;free FA decomposition at 333 K without any additive. Both values represent the top levels among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. This work demonstrates that zeolite&#8208;encaged metallic catalysts hold great promise to realize CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen energy cycles in the future featuring fast charging and releasing kinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Corannulene&#8208;Based Curved Nanographenes</title>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Zephycarinatines via Photocatalytic Reductive Radical ipso&#8208;Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a nonbiomimetic strategy for the total synthesis of the plicamine&#8208;type alkaloids, zephycarinatines C and D. The key feature of the synthesis was the stereoselective reductive radical  ipso&#8208;cyclization using visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. This cyclization enabled the construction of a 6,6&#8208;spirocyclic core structure by the addition of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the aromatic ring. The biological evaluation of zephycarinatines and their derivatives revealed that the synthetic derivative having a keto group displayed moderate inhibitory activity against LPS&#8208;induced NO production. This approach would offer future opportunities to expand the chemical diversity derived from plicamine&#8208;type alkaloids as well as provide useful intermediates for their syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal Catalyzed Insertion Reactions with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>Donor/donor carbenes &#160; are relatively new in the field of carbene chemistry; applications in C&#8211;H and X&#8211;H insertion reactions are few in number, but demonstrate exquisite chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Recent reports have shown that C&#8211;H, &#160; N&#8211;H, B&#8211;H, O&#8211;H, Si&#8211;H, Ge&#8211;H, Sn&#8211;H and P&#8211;H &#160;insertion reactions are feasible with a variety of transition metal catalysts, both inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecularly. Furthermore, high degrees of diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity have been observed in several cases. Methods typically involve the formation of a diazo&#8208;based carbene precursor, but procedures using diazo&#8208;free metal carbenes have been developed with significant success. This Minireview covers the span of all transition metal catalyzed reactions with donor/donor and donor carbenes, providing context for future developments in this upcoming field .</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Donor/donor carbenes &#160; are relatively new in the field of carbene chemistry; applications in C&#8211;H and X&#8211;H insertion reactions are few in number, but demonstrate exquisite chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Recent reports have shown that C&#8211;H, &#160; N&#8211;H, B&#8211;H, O&#8211;H, Si&#8211;H, Ge&#8211;H, Sn&#8211;H and P&#8211;H &#160;insertion reactions are feasible with a variety of transition metal catalysts, both inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecularly. Furthermore, high degrees of diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity have been observed in several cases. Methods typically involve the formation of a diazo&#8208;based carbene precursor, but procedures using diazo&#8208;free metal carbenes have been developed with significant success. This Minireview covers the span of all transition metal catalyzed reactions with donor/donor and donor carbenes, providing context for future developments in this upcoming field .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>External fields enhanced photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient conversion of solar energy by means of photocatalysis shows huge potential to relieve energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, the unsatisfied conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. Introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on the recent advances in the diversified external fields, involving the microwave, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field and coupled fields, boosted photocatalytic reactions, including contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO  2  reduction and bacterial inactivation.

      <title>Hydrogen bonding enhances the electrochemical hydrogenation of benzaldehyde in the aqueous phase</title>
      <dc:description>The hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol on carbon&#8208;supported metals in water, enabled by an external potential, is markedly promoted by polarization of the functional groups. The presence of polar co&#8208;adsorbates such as substituted phenols enhances the hydrogenation rate of the aldehyde via two effects&#8211;polarizing the carbonyl group and increasing the probability of forming a transition state for H addition. These two effects enable a hydrogenation route, in which phenol acts as a conduit for proton addition, with a higher rate than the direct proton transfer from hydronium ions. The fast hydrogenation enabled by the presence of phenol and applied potential overcompensates for the decrease in coverage of benzaldehyde caused by competitive adsorption. A higher acid strength of the co&#8208;adsorbate increases the intensity of interactions and the rates of selective carbonyl reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Desymmetrized Vertex Design toward a Molecular Cage with Unusual Topology</title>
      <dc:description>A novel low&#8208;symmetry organic molecular cage with distinctive geometry was successfully synthesized from 5,5'&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalaldehyde) and 1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine building blocks, through the desymmetrized vertex design strategy. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that the cage contains asymmetrical and nonplanar windows, exhibiting an unprecedented C2 symmetry and an efficient packing. The molecular cage structure was also characterized by FT&#8208;IR, NMR, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and POM. Quantum chemistry studies show that the cage structure contains rare intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8211;C) bonding interactions.

      <title>Photocontrolled Cobalt Catalysis for Selective Hydroboration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>Selectivity between 1,2 and 1,4 addition of a nucleophile to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound has classically been modified by the addition of stoichiometric additives to the substrate or reagent to increase their &#8216;hard&#8217; or &#8216;soft&#8217; character.

In this way, we bias the reaction down two divergent pathways, giving contrasting products in the catalytic hydroboration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. This includes direct access to previously elusive cyclic enolborates,  via  1,4&#8208;selective hydroboration, providing a straightforward and stereoselective route to rare  syn&#8208;aldol products in one&#8208;pot.

Thus, compared with doped films, the emission of neat films of  DCPA&#8208;TPA  and  DCPA&#8208;BBPA  can fully fall into the NIR region (&gt;700 nm) with increasing surrounding polarity by increasing doping ratio. Moreover, the non&#8208;doped devices based on  DCPA&#8208;TPA  and  DCPA&#8208;BBPA  provide NIR emission with peaks at 838 and 916 nm, respectively.

      <title>Fluorination Chemistry Enhances NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence of Polymer Dots for Quantitative Brain Tumor Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent probes in the second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II, 1000~1700 nm) have resulted in unprecedented imaging performance. Here, we describe a fluorination strategy in semiconducting polymers for development of highly bright NIR&#8208;II probes. Notably, tetrafluorination yielded a fluorescence QY of 3.2% for the polymer dots (Pdots), over 3&#8208;fold enhancement as compared to non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. The fluorescence enhancement was attributable to nanoscale fluorous effect in the Pdots that maintained the molecular planarity and minimized the structure distortion between the excited state and ground state, thus reducing the nonradiative relaxations. Followed by through&#8208;skull and through&#8208;scalp imaging of the brain vasculature of live mice, we quantitatively analyzed the vascular morphology of transgenic brain tumors in terms of the vessel lengths, vessel branches, and vessel symmetry, which showed statistically significant differences from the wild type animals. The bright NIR&#8208;II Pdots achieved by fluorination chemistry provide insightful information for precise diagnosis of the malignancy of the brain tumor.</dc:description>

      <title>Spin Ice&#8208;like Magnetic Relaxation of a Two&#8208;dimensional Network based on Manganese(III) Salen&#8208;type Single&#8208;molecule Magnets</title>
      <dc:description>Spin ice is an exotic type of magnetism displayed by bulk rare&#8208;earth pyrochlore oxides.

This magnetic system can be considered as a two&#8208;dimensional network of Mn  III  salen&#8208;type single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), in which each SMM unit (  S  T  = 4) has two orthogonally oriented axial anisotropies and is connected ferromagnetically through the [Mn(CN)  6  ]  3&#8722;  unit (  S  = 1). This work illustrates that a two&#8208;dimensional SMM network with competition between the ferromagnetic interaction and local noncollinear magnetic anisotropies on SMMs is a new type of magnetic system exhibiting slow relaxation of magnetization with a Davidson&#8211;Cole&#8208;type broad distribution of the relaxation time.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic Gas Separation in Oriented ZIF&#8208;95 Membranes Prepared by Vapor&#8208;Assisted In&#8208;Plane Epitaxial Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Control of the microstructure like grain orientation, grain boundaries and thickness are crucial for MOF membranes. In the present work, we develop a novel synthesis strategy to prepare highly c&#8208;oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membranes through vapor&#8208;assisted in&#8208;plane epitaxial growth. In a mixed DMF/water vapor atmosphere, in&#8208;plane epitaxial growth of a ZIF&#8208;95 seeds layer is achieved to obtain an oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membrane with a thickness of only 600 nm. Demonstrated by both experimental and simulation studies, the c&#8208;oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane displays superior separation performances since a perfectly oriented structure results in a notable reduction of inter&#8208;crystalline defects and transport pathways. For the separation of equimolar binary mixtures at 100 &#176;C and 1 bar, the mixture separation factors of H  2  /CO  2  and H  2  /CH  4  are 32.2 and 53.7, respectively, with H  2  permeance of over 7.9 x 10  &#8208;7  mol&#183;m  &#8208;2  &#183;s  &#8208;1  &#183;Pa  &#8208;1  , which is 4.6 times higher than that of a randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.</dc:description>

      <title>Reverse Thinking of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Principle: Amplifying Molecular Motions to Boost Photothermal Efficiency of Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>Development of efficient photothermal nanofibers is of vital importance, but remaining a big challenge. Herein, with reverse thinking of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) principle, we demonstrate an ingenious and universal protocol for amplifying molecular motions to boost photothermal efficiency of nanofibers. Core&#8208;shell nanofibers having the olive oil solution of AIE&#8208;active molecules as the core surrounded by PVDF&#8208;HFP shell were constructed by coaxial electrospinning. The molecularly dissolved state of AIE&#8208;active molecules allows them to freely rotate and/or vibrate in nanofibers upon photoexcitation and thus significantly elevates the proportion of non&#8208;radiative energy dissipation, affording impressive heat&#8208;generating efficiency. Photothermal evaluation shows that the core&#8208;shell nanofibers with excellent durability can reach up to 22.36% of photothermal conversion efficiency, which is 26&#8208;fold as the non&#8208;core&#8208;shell counterpart.

      <title>Photoassisted Selective Steam and Dry Reforming of Methane to Syngas Catalyzed by Rhodium&#8208;Vanadium Bimetallic Oxide Cluster Anions at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>The use of photo&#8208;energy represents a promising strategy driving endothermic steam (water) reforming and dry (carbon dioxide) reforming of methane (SRM and DRM) to syngas under mild conditions, but it remains a serious challenge of low syngas selectivity. The precise control of each elementary reaction and acquisition of the crucial step at which photo&#8208;irradiation should be applied are indispensable for engineering the product selectivity. Herein, photoassisted SRM and DRM reactions at room temperature with high syngas selectivity have been successfully achieved in the gas phase catalysis for the first time. The catalysts used are bimetallic rhodium&#8208;vanadium oxide cluster anions of Rh2VO1&#8722;3&#8722;  . Both the oxidation of methane and reduction of H2O/CO2  can take place efficiently in the dark while the pivotal step to govern syngas selectivity is photo&#8208;excitation of the reaction intermediates Rh2  VO2,3CH2&#8722;  to specific electronically excited states that can selectively produce CO and H2  . The important process of electronic excitation over Rh2  VO2,3CH2&#8722;  to control the syngas selectivity is further confirmed from the comparison with the thermal excitation of Rh2VO2,3CH2  &#8722;  , which leads to diversity of products. The atomic&#8208;level mechanism obtained from the well&#8208;controlled cluster reactions provides a new insight into the process of selective syngas production from the photocatalytic SRM and DRM reactions over the catalysts of supported metal oxides.</dc:description>

In this work, by growing amorphous multi&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (cobalt and iron) oxide on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP), we develop a bifunctional electrocatalyst (CoFeO@BP), which is able to efficiently catalyze both HER and OER. The overpotentials for the hybrid CoFeO@BP catalyst to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm  2  in 1 M KOH are 88 and 266 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Based on a series of ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ investigations, the excellent catalytic performance of CoFeO@BP is found to result from the adaptive surface structure under reduction and oxidation potentials. Benefitted from the metastability of amorphous cobalt iron oxide and its strong affinity with BP, CoFeO@BP can be transformed to CoFe phosphide under reduction potential, in&#8208;situ generating the real active catalyst for HER. While under oxidation potential, the oxygen vacancy rich amorphous cobalt iron oxide on BP tends to catalyze OER following the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), which kinetically facilitates OER catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>[3+2] Cycloadditions of O&#8208;Isocyanates Acting as Uncharged 1,3&#8208;Dipole Equivalents</title>
      <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Dipoles are commonly used in [3+2] cycloadditions, whereas isoelectronic uncharged dipole variants remain underdeveloped. In contrast to conventional 1,3&#8208;dipoles, uncharged dipole equivalents form zwitterionic cycloadducts, which can be exploited to build further molecular complexity. Herein the first cycloadditions of oxygen&#8208;substituted isocyanates (O&#8208;isocyanates) are studied experimentally and by DFT calculations. This unique cycloaddition strategy allowed access to a novel class of heterocycle&#8212;azaoxonium ylides via intramolecular and intermolecular cycloadditions with alkenes. This allowed a systematic study of the reactivity of the transient aza&#8208;oxonium ylide intermediate, which can undergo N&#8208;O bond cleavage followed by nitrene C&#8208;H insertion, and the formation of B&#8208;lactams or isoxazolidinones by varying the structure of the alkene or O&#8208;isocyanate reagents.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;sulfur linkages achieved by organic tethering of Ru nanocrystals for enhanced electrochemical nitrogen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR) is a clean, facile, and sustainable approach towards ammonia (NH  3  ) production at ambient conditions. However, the inert nature of nitrogen and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) command it towards sluggish kinetics and poor selectivity. Inspired by the metal&#8208;sulfur (M&#8208;S) linkages in the nitrogenase enzyme, here we show a surface modification strategy to modulate the electronic structure and improve the N  2  availability on the catalytic surface, which suppresses the HER and synergistically improved the rate of NH  3  production. Thus, ruthenium nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Ru/rGO) are modified with different aliphatic thiols to achieve M&#8208;S linkages. A high faradaic efficiency (11%) with an improved NH  3  yield (50 &#181;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  ) is achieved at &#8208;0.1 V vs RHE in acidic conditions by using dodecanethiol. DFT calculations reveal intermediate N  2  adsorption and desorption of the product is achieved by electronic structure modification along with the suppression of the HER by surface modification. The modified catalyst exerts excellent stability and recyclability for NH  3  production, as confirmed by rigorous control experiments including the  15  N isotope labeling experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>Removing Formaldehyde&#8208;Induced Peptidyl Crosslinks Enables Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Peptide Hormone Distributions from Formalin&#8208;Fixed Paraffin&#8208;Embedded Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>Linking molecular and chemical changes to human disease states depends on the availability of appropriate clinical samples, mostly preserved as formalin&#8208;fixed paraffin&#8208;embedded (FFPE) specimens stored in tissue banks. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an established technique that enables visualization of the spatiotemporal distribution of molecules in biological samples. However, MSI is not effective for imaging FFPE tissues because of the chemical modifications of analytes, including complex crosslinking between nucleophilic moieties. Here we used an MS&#8208;compatible inorganic nucleophile, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to chemically reverse inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crosslinks from endogenous molecules. The analyte restoration appears specific for formaldehyde&#8208;reactive amino acid residues. This approach enabled the MSI&#8208;assisted localization of pancreatic peptides expressed in the alpha, beta, and gamma cells. Pancreatic islet&#8208;like distributions of islet hormones were observed in human FFPE tissues preserved for more than five years, demonstrating that the rich repertoire of samples from biobanks can effectively be investigated with MSI.</dc:description>

      <title>Singlet heterofission in tetracene&#8208;pentacene thin&#8208;film blends</title>
      <dc:description>Heterofission, the photophysical process converting an excited singlet state into two triplets on chemically distinct chromophores, offers great potential for a tuning of the optical bandgap and the splitting between singlet and triplet energies, with both fundamental and applied interest. Here, we report the time&#8208;domain observation of heterofission in mixed thin films of the prototypical singlet fission chromophores pentacene and tetracene using excitation wavelengths above and below the tetracene bandgap. We find a time constant of 26 ps for endothermic heterofission of a singlet exciton on pentacene in blends with low pentacene fractions, which is outcompeted by pentacene homofission for increasing pentacene concentrations. Direct excitation of tetracene leads to fast energy transfer to pentacene and subsequent singlet fission which prevents homofission or heterofission of a singlet exciton on tetracene.</dc:description>

      <title>Design and scalable synthesis of novel N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;hydroxylamine reagents for the direct, Fe&#8208;catalyzed installation of medicinally relevant amines</title>
      <dc:description>Secondary and tertiary alkylamines are privileged substance classes which are often found in pharmaceuticals and other biologically active small molecules. Herein, we report their direct synthesis from alkenes through an aminative difunctionalization reaction enabled by iron catalysis. A family of ten novel hydroxylamine&#8208;derived aminating reagents were designed for the installation of several medicinally relevant amine groups, such as methylamine, morpholine and piperazine, through the aminochlorination of alkenes. The methodology displays an excellent functional group tolerance, and a broad scope of alkenes was converted to the corresponding products, including several drug&#8208;like molecules. Besides aminochlorination, the installation of other functionalities through aminoazidation, aminohydroxylation and even intramolecular carboamination reactions, is demonstrated, further highlighting the broad potential of these new reagents for the discovery of novel amination reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Elucidating Zeolite Channel Geometry&#8208;Reaction Intermediates Relationships during the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical industry has exploited zeolite shape selectivity for more than 50 years, yet our fundamental understanding remains still limited. Herein, the zeolite channel geometry&#8208;reactive intermediates relationships have been studied in detail over anisotropic zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystals during the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process, using advanced magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The utilization of anisotropic crystals enabled the preferential formation of reactive intermediates in single oriented zeolite channels, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and  in&#8208;situ  UV&#8208;Vis diffuse&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The ssNMR results show that the slightly more rigid sinusoidal zeolite channels favor the olefin cycle by promoting the homologation of alkanes, while the extended straight zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 channels foster the aromatic cycle with a higher degree of alkylation of aromatics. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments further indicate the preferential formation of heavy aromatics at the sinusoidal channel dominated surface, providing further insights into catalyst deactivation.</dc:description>

      <title>Utilizing a photocatalysis process to achieve a cathode with low charging overpotential and high cycling durability for a Li&#8208;O2 battery</title>
      <dc:description>The practical applications of non&#8208;aqueous lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries are impeded by large overpotentials and unsatisfactory cycling durability. Herein, we report that commonly encountered fatal problems can be efficiently solved by using a carbon&#8208; and binder&#8208;free electrode of titanium coated with TiO  2  nanotube arrays (TNAs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Ultraviolet irradiation of the TNAs generates positively charged holes, which efficiently decompose Li  2  O  2 &#160;and Li2CO3 during recharging thereby reducing the overpotential to near the equilibrium potential for Li  2  O  2  formation. The AuNPs promote Li  2  O  2  formation resulting in a large discharge capacity. The electrode exhibits excellent stability with ~100% coulombic efficiency during continuous cycling of up to 200 cycles which is due to the carbon&#8208; and binder&#8208;free composition. This work reveals a new strategy towards the development of highly efficient oxygen electrode materials for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries.</dc:description>

Our approach involves a diastereoselective diboration of alkenyl cyclopropyl methanol derivatives followed by a regioselective exergonic ring fragmentation.

      <dc:description>We report the rearrangement of sulfur&#8208;containing aldehydes using a sulfonium enamine intermediate as a formylcarbene mimetic. This is an enantioselective, organocatalytic [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enabling chiral cyclic sulfides bearing an &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral center to be prepared in high optical purity.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the rearrangement of sulfur&#8208;containing aldehydes using a sulfonium enamine intermediate as a formylcarbene mimetic. This is an enantioselective, organocatalytic [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enabling chiral cyclic sulfides bearing an &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral center to be prepared in high optical purity. The enantioselectivity is controlled with a cooperative organocatalyst pair consisting of a chiral amine and a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). The synthetic versatility of this method is demonstrated by its rapid access to structurally diverse chiral spiro S&#8208;heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Enzyme&#8208;Free Release of Nucleotides from Phosphoramidates Depends Strongly on the Amino Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphoramidates composed of an amino acid and a nucleotide analog are critical metabolites of prodrugs, such as remdesivir. Hydrolysis of the phosphoramidate liberates the nucleotide that can then be phosphorylated to become the pharmacologically active triphosphate. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been demonstrated, but a spontaneous chemical process may also occur. We measured the rate of enzyme&#8208;free hydrolysis for 17 phosphoramidates of ribonucleotides with amino acids or related compounds at pH 7.5. Phosphoramidates of proline hydrolyzed fast, with a half&#8208;life time as short as 2.4&#160;h for Pro&#8208;AMP in ethylimidazole&#8208;containing buffer at 37&#160;&#176;C; 45&#8208;fold faster than Ala&#8208;AMP and 120&#8208;fold faster than Phe&#8208;AMP. Crystal structures of Gly&#8208;AMP, Pro&#8208;AMP, &#946;Pro&#8208;AMP and Phe&#8208;AMP bound to RNase A as crystallization chaperone showed how well the carboxylate is poised to attack the phosphoramidate, helping to explain this reactivity.

      <title>Photochemically Induced Ring Opening of Spirocyclopropyl Oxindoles: Evidence for a Triplet 1,3&#8208;Diradical Intermediate and Deracemization by a Chiral Sensitizer</title>
      <dc:description>The photochemical deracemization of spiro[cyclopropane&#8208;1,3'&#8208;indolin]&#8208;2'&#8208;ones (spirocyclopropyl oxindoles) was studied. For the corresponding 2,2&#8208;dichloro compound it was found that it is configurationally labile upon direct irradiation at &#955; = 350 nm and upon irradiation at &#955; = 405 nm in the presence of achiral thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the sensitizer. The triplet 1,3&#8208;diradical intermediate generated in the latter reaction was detected by transient absorption spectroscopy and its lifetime was determined (&#964; = 22 ms). Using a chiral thio&#173;xanthone or xanthone both with a lactam hydrogen bonding site as a photosensitizer allowed the deracemization of differently substituted chiral spirocyclopropyl oxindoles with yields of 65&#8208;98% and in 50&#8208;85% ee (17 examples). Three mechanistic contributions were identified to co&#8208;act favourably for high enantioselectivity. First, the binding constants to the chiral thioxanthone differ by a factor of 3 for the minor and the major enantiomers. Second, the molecular distance is smaller by &#8776; 100 pm in the complex of the minor enantiomer, presumably promoting a more efficient energy transfer. Third, the lifetime of the intermediate 1,3&#8208;diradical exceeds the one of the complex, facilitating a racemic deactivation back to the ground state.</dc:description>

Herein, we explored the impact of enzyme orientation on the performance of lipase&#8208;powered nanomotors by tuning the lipase immobilization strategies.

      <title>Para&#8208;Selective Arylation of Arenes: A Direct Route to Biaryls by Norbornene Relay Palladation</title>
      <dc:description>Biaryls are extremely important structural motifs in natural products, biologically active components and pharmaceuticals. Selective synthesis of biaryls by distinguishing the subtle reactivity difference of distal arene&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds are significantly challenging. However, prudent orchestration of suitable directing group to mitigate the required geometrical orientation for site selective functionalizations can lead to a handful tool to construct the molecular complexity. Herein we embarked on exploring the  para  &#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation which is contemplated by a unique combination of a  meta  &#8208;directing group and norbornene as transient mediator. Upon direct  meta  &#8208;C&#8722;H palladation, one bond relay palladation has been envisioned in presence of norbornene and subsequently  para  &#8208;C&#8722;H arylation is achieved for diverse scaffolds with aryl iodides. The scope of the protocol is broad with respect to both the coupling partners.</dc:description>

Upon direct  meta  &#8208;C&#8722;H palladation, one bond relay palladation has been envisioned in presence of norbornene and subsequently  para  &#8208;C&#8722;H arylation is achieved for diverse scaffolds with aryl iodides. The scope of the protocol is broad with respect to both the coupling partners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enabling Racemization of Axially Chiral Subphthalocyanine&#8211;Tetracyanobutadiene&#8211;Aniline Enantiomers by Triplet State Photogeneration</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, several tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) conjugates have been prepared by linking the tetracyano unit to various electroactive moieties. These push&#8208;pull conjugates, besides showing interesting physicochemical properties, are axially chiral, a feature arising from the restricted rotation around the butadiene&#8217;s central bond. Yet, only in a few cases, enantiomers&#8217; separation and isolation have been successfully achieved, owing to the configurational lability of the corresponding enantiopure species. Herein, we report on the first example of photo&#8208; and electroactive TCBD&#8208;based derivatives showing unprecedented configurational stability and a peculiar light&#8208;triggered enantiomer conversion mechanism enabled by triple&#8208;state photogeneration. These systems represent a nice addition to the fast&#8208;increasing arsenal of artificial, light&#8208;controllable molecular switches.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Difunctionalizing Carboxylation of Unactivated Alkenes with CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful and efficient tool to synthesize complex molecules from simple starting materials. Remote difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is more challenging but highly attractive tactic to install two functional groups across long distances. Herein, we report the first remote difunctionalization of alkenes with CO  2  . This visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis strategy provides a facile method to synthesize a series of carboxylic acids, such as non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, bearing valuable fluorine&#8208; or phosphorus&#8208;containing functional groups. Moreover, this versatile protocol shows mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. Based on DFT calculations, the observed reaction starts via radical addition to an unactivated alkene to smoothly form a new carbon radical. The following 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process, which is considered to be the rate&#8208;limiting step, generates a more stable benzylic radical. In contrast to previous reports of direct coupling or single&#8208;electron oxidation of such radical species, experimental and computational studies suggest the reduction of the benzylic radicals by an Ir(II) species generates the corresponding benzylic carbanions as the key intermediates, which further undergo nucleophilic attack with CO  2  to generate carboxylates. Following this mechanistic study, diverse electrophiles, including aldehydes, ketones and benzylic bromides, are also applicable in such transformation, demonstrating a general strategy for redox&#8208;neutral remote difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes.</dc:description>

      <title>A New Multi&#8208;action Pt(IV) Conjugate with Oleate and Cinnamate Ligands Targets Human Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor HER2 in Aggressive Breast Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer represents aggressive subtype typical of poor response to standard chemotherapy. To design an anticancer drug selective for HER2 expressing breast cancer, the new Pt(IV) prodrug with axial oleate and cinnamate ligands was synthesized. We demonstrate its superior antiproliferative activity in monolayer and 3D spheroid models; the antiproliferative efficiency increases gradually with increasing expression of HER2. The results also suggest that the released Pt(II) compound inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells by DNA&#8208;damage mediated mechanism. Simultaneously, the released oleic and cinnamic acid can effectively inhibit HER2 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first platinum&#8208;based complex inhibiting HER2 expression containing no protein or peptide. Moreover, the new Pt(IV) prodrug is capable of overcoming the resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) inducing death in both CSCs and differentiated cancer cells. Thus, the results substantiate our design strategy and demonstrate the potential of this approach for the development of new, therapeutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

The synthesis features a convergent strategy, which provides a flexible approach to prepare the biogenetically cephalotaxus diterpenoids and structurally related derivatives for biological studies.

      <dc:description>
19F NMR&#8208;based fragment screening&#160;is an effective approach in pharmaceutical research to explore the chemical space for specific target&#8211;ligand interactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002463), A. Lingel, A.&#8197;O. Frank et&#8197;al. report on the development of NMR pulses that cover the entire drug&#8208;like fluorine chemical shift range in a single experiment. The new method allows for the efficient assembly of diverse fragment libraries that can be screened for high&#8208;quality hits within a few days.

      <dc:description>
Rabies virus&#8208;inspired metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MILB@LR) for targeted imaging and chemotherapy of glioma are demonstrated by Z. Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007474). Inspired by the extraordinary capability of rabies virus (RABV) to enter the central nervous system, MILB@LR were designed to closely mimick both the bullet&#8208;shape structure and surface functions of natural RABV. MILB@LR exhibit significantly enhanced glioma targeting and superior inhibition of glioma growth when loaded with oxaliplatin.

      <dc:description>
An ultrastable silver nanocluster was synthesized by K. Yamaguchi, K. Suzuki et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008402) by using lacunary polyoxometalates. In the cover picture, the green polydedra represent&#160;lacunary polyoxometalates and the light gray spheres silver atoms. While small silver nanoclusters are typically highly fragile, the small Ag7 nanocluster shows unprecedented stability when surrounded by a&#160;triangular hollow polyoxometalate framework.

      <dc:description>
sp3 quantum defects can be used for covalent functionalization of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) under preservation of their near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003825), S. Kruss et&#8197;al. describe how peptide chains are directly grown on the SWCNT's sidewall by using a Fmoc&#8208;protected phenylalanine defect. A second maleimide defect enables attachment of proteins via thiol groups. This chemistry provides access to NIR&#8208;fluorescent SWCNT bioconjugates and applications in photonics, biosensing and medicine.

      <title>Supercritical Water is not Hydrogen Bonded</title>
      <dc:description>Thinking about water is inextricably linked to hydrogen&#8208;bonds, which are highly directional in character and determine the unique structure of water, in particular its tetrahedral H&#8208;bond network. Here, we assess if this common connotation also holds for supercritical water. We employ extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to systematically monitor the evolution of the H&#8208;bond network mode of water from room temperature, where it is the hallmark of its fluctuating three&#8208;dimensional network structure, to supercritical conditions. Our simulations reveal that the oscillation period required for H&#8208;bond vibrations to occur exceeds the lifetime of H&#8208;bonds in supercritical water by far. Instead, the corresponding low&#8208;frequency intermolecular vibrations of water pairs as seen in supercritical water are found to be well represented by isotropic van der Waals interactions only. Based on these findings, we conclude that water in its supercritical phase is not a H&#8208;bonded fluid.</dc:description>

      <title>Ethylene Dehydroaromatization over Ga&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Catalysts: Nature and Role of Gallium Speciation</title>
      <dc:description>Bifunctional catalysis in zeolites possessing both Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid sites offers unique opportunities to tailor shape selectivity and enhance catalyst performance. Here, we examine the impact of framework and extra&#8208;framework gallium species on enriched aromatics production in zeolite ZSM&#8208;5. In this study we compare three distinct methods of preparing Ga&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and reveal direct (single step) synthesis leads to optimal catalysts compared to post&#8208;synthesis methods. Using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization, catalyst testing, and density functional theory calculations, we show that Ga Lewis acid sites strongly favor aromatization. Our findings also suggest Ga(framework) &#8211; Ga(extra&#8208;framework) pairings, which can only be achieved in materials prepared by direct synthesis, are the most energetically favorable sites for reaction pathways leading to aromatics. Calculated acid site exchange energies between extra&#8208;framework Ga at framework sites comprised of either Al or Ga reveal a site&#8208;specific preference for stabilizing Lewis acids, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental measurements. These findings indicate the possibility of tailoring Lewis acid siting by the placement of Ga heteroatoms at distinct tetrahedral sites in the zeolite framework, which can have a marked impact on catalyst performance relative to conventional H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5.</dc:description>

      <title>Making or breaking metal&#8208;dependent catalytic activity: The role of stammers in designed three&#8208;stranded coiled coils</title>
      <dc:description>While many life critical reactions would be infeasibly slow without metal cofactors, a detailed understanding of how protein structure can influence catalytic activity remains elusive. Using de novo designed 3&#8208;stranded coiled coils (TRI and Grand peptides formed using a heptad repeat approach), we examine how the insertion of a three residue discontinuity, known as a stammer insert, directly adjacent to a (His)3 metal binding site alters catalytic activity. The stammer, which locally alters the twist of the helix, significantly increases copper catalyzed nitrite reductase activity (CuNiR). In contrast, the well&#8208;established zinc catalyzed carbonic anhydrase activity (p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate, pNPA) is effectively ablated. This study illustrates for the first time how perturbation of the protein sequence using non&#8208;coordinating and non&#8208;acid base residues in the helical core can perturb metalloenzyme activity through the simple expedient of modifying the helical pitch adjacent to the catalytic center.</dc:description>

We show that an active particle&#8211;active electrode type scheme can provide valuable mechanistic insight into electrochemical reactions.

      <title>PhotoAffinity Bits: A photoaffinity&#8208;based fragment screening platform for efficient identification of protein ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Advances in genomic analyses enable the identification of new proteins that are associated with disease. To validate these targets, tool molecules are required to demonstrate that a ligand can have a disease&#8208;modifying effect. Currently, as tools are reported for only a fraction of the proteome, platforms for ligand discovery are essential to leverage insights from genomic analyses. Fragment screening offers an efficient approach to explore chemical space. We present a fragment screening platform, termed PhABits (PhotoAffinity Bits), which utilises a library of photoreactive fragments to covalently capture fragment&#8208;protein interactions. Hits can be profiled to determine potency and site of crosslinking, and subsequently developed as reporters in a competitive displacement assay to identify novel hit matter. We envision that the PhABits will be widely applicable to novel protein targets, identifying starting points in the development of therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>K2Sb(P2O7)F:&#160; Unprecedented Cairo Pentagonal Layer with New Bifunctional Genes Revealing Excellent Optical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Discovering new functional genes, designing perfect crystal structures, and developing high performance materials are the goal being pursued by scientists. Herein, the first antimony pyrophosphate, K2Sb(P2O7)F, possessing an optimal layered structure is reported, where the perfect structure arrangement induces excellent optical properties. K2Sb(P2O7)F not only displays a sharply enhanced birefringence (0.157@546 nm) compared to the existing phosphate optical materials, but also exhibits a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (4.0 &#215; KDP). &#160;Remarkably, a new bifunctional gene, the square pyramidal SbO4F group, was discovered and a unique 2D arrangement of Cairo pentagonal tiling units was observed in inorganic compounds for the first time.</dc:description>
