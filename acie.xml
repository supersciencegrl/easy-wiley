         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>

Twelve unprecedented terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers and their monomers were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27, which represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. Mechanically, DCTPP1 was a novel potential clinically effective biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.







Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer&#8208;Based Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an Aptamer&#8208;based and Urease&#8208;mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.







Abstract
Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000&#8208;fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl&#8208;ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3&#8208;helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8&#8208;ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

         <title>Hyperconjugation&#8208;Driven Isodesmic Reaction of Indoles and Anilines: Reaction Discovery, Mechanism Study, and Antitumor Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines was developed in this work. The &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation between alkyl group and indole ring was identified as the driving force of this transformation through theoretical and experimental studies. The developed methodology was applied to obtain antitumor quindoline derivatives that exhibited substantial activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo models.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional&#8208;group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers.







Abstract
Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74&#8201;% yield, &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our study provides a highly capable imine reductase and a protocol for developing an efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination reaction system.

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>

The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, morphologies, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polyimide film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.







Abstract
Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.

We developed an efficient strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of pyridines using transient enamine&#8208;type intermediates from N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process utilizes EDA complexes, achieving high selectivity without external photocatalysts.

Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst. The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.

         <title>Efficient Derivatization of a Thienobenzobisthiazole&#8208;Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Towards High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers based on thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) with alkyl, ester, and acyl groups are synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy, where the TBTz&#8208;monomers are efficiently synthesized via the common intermediate. Among them, the ester&#8208;functionalized polymer shows the highest power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic cells with a small nonradiative voltage loss and a high charge generation efficiency.







Abstract
Derivatization is essential for optimizing organic material properties. However, because functional groups are often introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, similar intermediates have to be repeatedly synthesized to produce derivatives, which amounts to a daunting and time&#8208;consuming task. Using thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) as a building unit of donor polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we demonstrate an efficient derivatization of a TBTz&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer by late&#8208;stage functionalization. In the developed synthetic route, functional groups are introduced at the last step of monomer synthesis, enabling us to easily synthesize several derivatives from a common intermediate. Ester and acyl groups are introduced into the polymer instead of the alkyl group, giving rise to deep HOMO energy levels and resulting in OPV cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage even in the absence of halogen substituents that are typically introduced into the donor polymers. Notably, the ester&#8208;functionalized TBTz&#8208;based polymer shows a small nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) of 0.19&#8197;V and has one of the highest charge generation efficiencies among the halogen&#8208;free donor polymers with similar &#916;Vnr, improving the critical trade&#8208;off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high&#8208;performance polymers for OPVs.

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the dual effects of incorporating active LMs into solid&#8208;state composite PEO electrolytes, including providing additional free volume for segmental relaxation to enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity and acting as dynamic chemical traps to realize self&#8208;healing protection against dendritic problems. These combined effects enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells with notable rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>A Fluorinated Imide&#8208;Functionalized Arene Enabling a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor for Record&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms were introduced at the &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. The SA1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved a record efficiency of 19.33&#8201;% (certified PCE: 19.17&#8201;%). These results highlight that F&#8208;BTI is a promising unit for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer donors for all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) present compelling advantages for commercial applications, including mechanical durability and optical and thermal stability. However, progress in developing high&#8208;performance polymer donors has trailed behind the emergence of excellent polymer acceptors. In this study, we report a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms are introduced at the outer &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. SA1 exhibits a deep HOMO level of &#8722;5.51&#8197;eV, a wide bandgap of 1.81&#8197;eV and suitable miscibility with the polymer acceptor. Polymer chains incorporating F&#8208;BTI result in a highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within the all&#8208;polymer active layer. Thus, SA1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 16.31&#8201;% with excellent stability, which is further enhanced to a record value of 19.33&#8201;% (certified: 19.17&#8201;%) by constructing ternary device. This work demonstrates that F&#8208;BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F&#8208;BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen-based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Lodged High&#8208;Valent High&#8208;Entropy Layered Double Hydroxide for Efficient, Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

We report a convenient multi&#8208;ionic co&#8208;precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&#8722; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8722; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi&#8208;planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular stacking in Z&#8208;W&#8208;03. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro&#8208;type HTMs incorporating quasi&#8208;planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self-immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self-immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate-linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite-linked PPGs results in the release of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol constructs a sieving&#8208;type EDL through strong hydrogen bond interlocking, which can reduce the presence of H2O and SO42&#8722; at the interface to inhibit side effects. It also restricts the diffusion of SO42&#8722;, thereby increasing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Therefore, the electrolyte containing SDE significantly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8722; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8722; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8722; can trap H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8722; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500&#8197;h and 2500&#8197;cycles respectively.

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

A general and modular synthetic strategy for covalent organic cages is reported. These cage receptors possess customized skeletons and sizes, diverse 3D structures, and excellent host&#8208;guest recognition for neutral aromatic diimides.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1.

First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one- or two-step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one-pot Friedel-Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4-dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5-dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host-guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Unraveling the Anionic Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; uptake/release in the aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries is firstly deciphered; together with the Mn redox reaction accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, the tailored manganese deficient MnO2 cathode with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; achieves an ultrahigh energy density and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability.







Abstract
Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra&#8208;capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO2&#8208;based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO2 micro&#8208;nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; (CaMnO&#8208;140) are prepared via a low&#8208;temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non&#8208;bonding O 2p states, the pre&#8208;intercalated Ca2+ can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO&#8208;140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch&#8208;type CaMnO&#8208;140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high&#8208;energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na-ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra-capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; micro-nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-pillars&#8221; (CaMnO-140) are prepared via a low-temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non-bonding O 2p states, the pre-intercalated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO-140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a marvelous long-term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; co-insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch-type CaMnO-140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide-temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high-energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Regulating Nucleic Acid Catalysis Using Active Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we use active, fuel&#8208;dependent complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles and spatiotemporally control the catalytic activity of the 17E DNAzyme. Partitioning the biocatalyst into the peptide&#8208;RNA droplets results in unfolding and activity loss. The catalytic activity is recovered after droplets transiently dissolve when fuel is used up, mimicking they dynamic regulation of biocatalytic pathways in membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro&#8208;Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing Eb, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the Eb. Single&#8208;component and bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by ITIC, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two ITIC&#8208;based NFAs bearing spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named SpiroT&#8208;DCI and SpiroF&#8208;DCI) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of SpiroF&#8208;DCI and ITIC are delocalized in the main &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, the HOMO of SpiroT&#8208;DCI is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, SpiroT&#8208;DCI exhibits a smaller Eb than either SpiroF&#8208;DCI or ITIC, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single&#8208;component OSCs. Furthermore, SpiroT&#8208;DCI shows improved PCEs for bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB&#8208;T, compared with that of either SpiroT&#8208;DCI or ITIC. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo&#8208;induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine SpiroT&#8208;DCI films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of ITIC, which is desirable for reducing the Eb and improving the PCE in OSCs.

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>

         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>

The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes is reported and enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under ligand&#8208;free conditions. Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles is achieved with chiral bisoxazoline ligands, providing access to &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.







Abstract
C(sp3) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand&#8208;free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;Induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The red delayed fluorescence polymer incorporating tetracoordinate boron were developed to study the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior. Modulating the emission wavelength of polymer depends on the solvent's electronic effects, which induce the equilibrium of the electrostatic potential distribution of fluorophore, as well as the strong intramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Tuning full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm with quantum yield of 9.15&#8201;% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588&#8197;nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.

         <title>Vertically Fluorinated Graphene Encapsulated SiOx Anode for Enhanced Li+ Transport and Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertically fluorinated graphene encapsulated SiOx anode with ultra&#8208;fast Li+ transfer and interfacial stability for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries was developed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of surface fluorination for the construction of LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interfaces.







Abstract
Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8722;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8197;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8722;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8722;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C in the SiOx@vG&#8722;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Allenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

&lt;p&gt;The first enantioselective Friedel-Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an arginine (Arg) residue adjacent to the latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa) significantly accelerates both SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This offers a general and biocompatible strategy to harness these robust click chemistries for fundamental and applied biological research, applicable in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.

Based on a strategy focusing on polar axial symmetry, a DUV transparent NLO crystal Mg2PO4Cl was discovered after screening over 10,000 phosphates. This crystal exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV compounds. Such a remarkable SHG effect can be attributed to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis.







Abstract
In the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) region, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals must meet stringent requirements, including a large optical band gap and sufficient second harmonic generation (SHG) response. Typically, these criteria are fulfilled by borates, carbonates and nitrates containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups. In contrast, sulfates and phosphates, with polarizabilities significantly smaller than those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, struggle to achieve similar performance. Here, we present the discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, a magnesium&#8208;based phosphate, identified from over 10,000 phosphates based on a polar&#8208;axial&#8208;symmetry screening strategy, which exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV transparent NLO crystals. This compound belongs to the Pna21 space group, with [PO4] units consistently aligned along the 21 screw axis and glide planes throughout its crystal structure. Theoretical calculations attribute its remarkable SHG effect to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis. Furthermore, a crystallographic structure analysis of phosphates and sulfates with significant SHG effects validates the effectiveness of our screening strategy. These findings offer valuable insights into the origins of NLO effects in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds from both a material design and structural chemistry perspective, inspiring future efforts to revitalize DUV phosphates.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO2 by MoO3&#8208;stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: Fact or Fiction? Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that contrary to literature reports the putative gold&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction is a two&#8208;stage process: gold&#8208;based heteroarylation followed by gold&#8208;free carbocationic rearrangements to olefins and tetrahydronaphthalenes.







Abstract
Two recent high&#8208;profile publications reported the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by MeDalPhosAuCl/AgOTf (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 8810) and their cyclisation to tetralines (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202312786). It was claimed that these were the first demonstrations in gold catalysis of alkene insertion into Au&#8208;aryl bonds, &#946;&#8208;H elimination and chain&#8208;walking by Au&#8722;H dications. We show here that in fact this chemistry is a two&#8208;stage process. Only the first step, the production of an alkyl triflate ester as the primary organic product by the well&#8208;known alkene heteroarylation sequence, involves gold. The subsequent formation of Heck&#8208;type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H+&#8208;triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]2+ dication have no basis in fact.

Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

Small Fish, big moves In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Synthetic Chemistry Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry has brought a revolution in our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems. However, the toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions is yet very limited. The field of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of mild and biocompatible chemical reactions, and thereby expanding the repertoire of bioorthogonal tools. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential for the selective generation of designed products within biorelevant or living settings.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems at the molecular level. However, the range of chemical reactions that can operate efficiently in biological environments without interfering with the native cellular machinery, remains limited. In this context, the rapidly growing area of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of bioorthogonal tools. The inherent mildness, tunability, chemoselectivity, and external controllability of photocatalytic transformations make them particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in biological and living systems. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential to enable the selective generation of designed products within biologically relevant or living settings.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra-pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;adsorption, employing anti-corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; binding to Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co-electrosynthesis of nano-sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed.

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>

         <dc:description>
As one of the central molecules for life, RNA is connected to various processes involved in disease. Achieving a targeted, specific and irreversible RNA degradation is both a challenge and a highly valuable goal for pushing forward the development of new therapeutics. This minireview aims to summarize and provide mechanistic insights into every approach so far to drug and irreversibly degrade disease&#8208;associated RNA using small molecules.







Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing an anthracene&#8208;based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high&#8208;yielding synthetic method for P&#8208;doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end&#8208;capping (thio)xanthyl unit.







Abstract
Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox&#8208;couple.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Protocol to Access Silacyclobutanes with Unprecedented Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control.







Abstract
Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.

Ion&#8208;Pair Catalysis. A sustainable protocol that metal&#8208;free deuteration employing ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; catalysis, facilitating selective substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium in arenes, with broad compatibility and high yields, was reported.







Abstract
A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method&#8216;s practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8197;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction.

This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;&#8208;complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous&#8208;wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Copper Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyrimidinyl Phosphine with both Axial and P&#8208;Stereogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the first NHC ligand&#8208;enabled Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction to obtain axial and P&#8208;chiral phosphines. The product can undergo a SNAr reaction with many nucleophiles for the rapid synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Drive Tandem Electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 catalysts with Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2 for the electroreduction of CO2, which exhibited excellent FEC2+ and FEEtOH. The coordinated tandem action of the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites enhanced the adsorption of the *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization, while stabilizing the crucial intermediate *CH2CHO, leading to improved selectivity towards C2+ and EtOH.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2 (Pz=Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9&#8201;% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5&#8201;% with remarkable stability when using 0.1&#8197;M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization on the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites play a synergistic tandem role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Acyclic 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl Alkenes as Limiting Substrates</title>

         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

Herein, we present the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared to Blue Photon Upconversion by Ultrafast Spin Flip and Triplet Energy Transfer at Organic/2D Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid state photon upconversion by triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion, holds instant promise for enhancing optoelectronic and photochemical applications. Despite extensive studies, NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion has remained particularly challenging and elusive due to inherent multiple energy&#8208;downhill processes in TTA upconversion. In this study, using atomically thin two dimensional (2D) monolayer semiconductor as a triplet sensitizer, we demonstrate an efficient and robust solid&#8208;state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion system. The ultrathin and flexible organic/2D bilayer heterostructure exhibits a NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion with high quantum yield (&#934;UC = 1.2%, out of 50%), low threshold power density (Ith = 110 mW/cm2) and a record&#8208;high apparent anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.12 eV. Further spin&#8208; and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast (&lt; 500 fs) electron spin flip to triplet&#8208;like excitons in semiconductor sensitizer and subsequent picosecond (~ 6&#215;1010 s&#8208;1) interfacial dexter energy transfer to annihilator molecules. The triplet energy transfer rate and efficiency depend strongly on driving force, exhibiting Marcus normal region behavior. This work demonstrates 2D monolayer semiconductor as a superior ultrathin light harvesting and triplet sensitization layer and reveals the key knob to overcome the compromise between upconversion efficiency and energy loss, offering a viable pathway to efficient solid state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion and implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Detailed View on the (Re)isomerization Dynamics in Microbial Rhodopsins using Complementary Near&#8208;UV and IR Readouts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomerization is a key process in many (bio)chemical systems. In microbial rhodopsins, the photoinduced isomerization of the all&#8208;trans retinal to the 13&#8208;cis isomer initiates a cascade of structural changes of the protein. The interplay between these changes and the thermal relaxation of the isomerized retinal is one of the crucial determinants for rhodopsin functionality. It is therefore important to probe this dynamic interplay with chromophore specific markers that combine gapless temporal observation with spectral sensitivity. Here we utilize the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region in the framework of a systematic (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic study on H+&#8208; (HsBR, (G)PR), Na+&#8208; (KR2, ErNaR) and Cl&#8208;&#8208; (NmClR) pumps. We demonstrate that the near&#8208;UV region is an excellent probe for retinal configuration and &#8208; being sensitive to the electrostatic environment of retinal &#8208; even transient ion binding, which allows us to pinpoint protein specific mechanistic nuances and chromophore&#8208;charge interactions. The combination of the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region hence provides a spectroscopic analysis tool that allows a detailed, precise and temporally fully resolved description of retinal configurations during all stages of the photocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy MAX Phases and Their Derivative MXenes for Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy materials hold immense promise for energy storage, owing to their varied compositions and unforeseen physicochemical properties, yet, which poses challenges in synthesis due to tendentious phase separation and extended sintering durations. Herein, an ultra&#8208;rapid strategy based on spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques is proposed to synthesize high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15 minutes, including a new phase of (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and several phases of 413&#8208;type TiVNbMoAlC3, TiVCrMoAlC3 and (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)4AlC3, achieving utmost purity level up to 99.54%. Under high temperature, the overfeed of Al with low melt point (~660&#176;C) can foster a liquid environment, which remits the immiscibility among starting materials and benefits to diffusion dynamics to some extents. Theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the thermodynamic preponderance of high&#8208;entropy MAX phases in the intricate multi&#8208;element systems. Meanwhile, the varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes can be observed directly at the atomic level. Moreover, four high&#8208;entropy MXenes as electrode materials were investigated for rechargeable batteries. Among them, TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) with outstanding stability for over 170 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6&#160;octahedrons to&#160;CrO4&#160;tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non&#8208;bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8211;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral 2&#8208;azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2&#8208;azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2&#8208;azetines (70&#8211;98% yields and up to 96% ee) through chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines. These 2&#8208;azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et3SiH, BF3&#8226;Et2O and water at rt for 2 minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones and sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring&#8208;opening reaction through Et3SiH, BF3&#8226;Et2O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90% yields and up to 91% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption Kinetics and Capacity of a Stable CeF3@Ni3N Heterostructure for Methanol Electro&#8208;Reforming Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline methanol&#8208;water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro&#8208;reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy&#8208;consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)2 lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH&#8208;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43 V at 500 mA cm&#8208;2, along with high stability over 72 h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76 mV to achieve 50 mA cm&#8208;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane&#8208;free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long&#8208;term stability and FEs at high current density of 300 mA cm&#8208;2. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by&#160;operando&#160;EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and Mg tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Mediated f&#8208;p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling: Achieving Selective Seawater Oxidation and Breaking *OH and *OOH Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we have developed a NiFelDH&#8208;FLPs electrocatalyst based on frustrated Lewis acidic&#8208;basic pairs (FLPs) for seawater oxidation for the first time. Based on the soft hard acid&#8208;base theory, the Lewis acidic sites of FLPs exhibit a strong affinity for OH&#8722;, while the Lewis basic sites demonstrate resistance to Cl&#8722;. Consequently, during the process of seawater electrolysis, the ClOR on the catalyst surface are effectively inhibited due to the existence of FLPs sites.







Abstract
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis plays a crucial role in producing renewable hydrogen energy. However, during the seawater electrolysis process, the anode inevitably undergoes chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) due to Cl&#8722; adsorption, making the seawater electrolysis process difficult to sustain. Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we propose a biomimetic design of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) layers for selective seawater oxidation. Combining experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been demonstrated that cerium dioxide layers with FLPs sites can decompose water molecules, capture hydroxyl anions, and repel chloride ions simultaneously. DFT theoretical analysis indicates that the FLP sites regulate the Ce&#8197;4&#8201;f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Ni&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling, providing additional oxygen non&#8208;bonding (ONB) to stabilize the Ni&#8722;O bond and optimize the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby breaking the *OH and *OOH scaling relationship. The assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can stably operate for 250&#8197;hours at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 catalyst was constructed to tune the lattice oxygen redox during OER, with catalytic mechanism elucidated. Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) compared to NiCo2O4. Electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution within NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as also verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis. The 18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry provides direct evidence that the oxygen released during the OER originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4. We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly active spinel oxides for OER and offers significant insights into the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;enhanced LOM mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare-earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution within NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The developed Ce&#8722;NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8722;NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non-concerted proton-electron transfers compared to pure NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, as also verified by pH-dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis. The &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry provides direct evidence that the oxygen released during the OER originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8722;NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in OER.

         <title>Synthesis of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fucoidan Analogue and Its Inhibitory Activities against Heparanase and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purpose&#8208;designed low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fucoidan analogue exhibited anti&#8208;heparanase activity even in the cell&#8208;based assay. In addition, the analogue inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the analogue effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitous on cell surfaces and is used as a receptor by many viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, increased activity of the inflammatory enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which hydrolyses HS, in patients with COVID&#8208;19 not only increases the severity of symptoms but also may facilitate the spread of the virus by degrading HS on the cell surface. Therefore, synthetic HPSE blockades, which can bind to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and inhibit viral entry, have attracted much attention. This study investigated the development of a new dual&#8208;targeting antiviral agent against HPSE and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S using fucoidan as a structural motif. It was found that all&#8208;sulfated fucoidan derivative 10, which exhibited the highest binding affinity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S among 13 derivatives, also showed the highest inhibitory activity against HPSE. Based on this, a newly designed and synthesized fucoidan analogue 16, in which the octyl group of 10 was changed to a cholestanyl group, was found to show approximately 3 times higher activity than 10 but did not inhibit factor Xa associated with undesired anticoagulant effects. The binding affinity of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S was significantly increased approximately 400&#8208;fold over that of 10. The binding of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and ACE2. Furthermore, 16 effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.

         <title>Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin&#8208;Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise modification of tin&#8208;oxo clusters via the heterometal strategy, specifically varying the metal dopants and their coordination geometries, has resulted in SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2, thereby tuning their distinct lithography performance.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin&#8208;oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2 were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;quality films via spin&#8208;coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs Atomic Force Microscopy&#8208;based Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM&#8208;IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X&#8208;ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50&#8197;nm line patterns, with SnOC&#8208;1(In) demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8722;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility&#8208;switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) was introduced as an organic anode for proton batteries. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, fast and efficient Grotthuss proton conduction is enabled in the solid&#8208;state with low activation energy (192.7&#8197;meV). When coupling with tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCBQ) cathode, the all&#8208;organic proton battery achieves long stability over 3500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their applications are limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and lower the redox potentials of quinone materials. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7&#8197;meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperature.

Two exotic P&#8208;bearing molecules, HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; are prepared as weakly bound complexes with CO in solid N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. The reaction kinetics for the spontaneous isomerization from HPN&#8901; to HNP&#8901; in the temperature range of 3&#8211;10&#8197;K reveals the dominant contribution by hydrogen atom tunneling.







Abstract
Phosphorus mononitride (PN) is a carrier of phosphorus in the interstellar medium. As the simplest derivatives of PN, the radical species HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; have remained elusive. Herein, we report the generation, characterization, and photochemistry of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; in N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. Specifically, HPN&#8901; was formed as a weakly bonded complex with CO in the matrix by 254&#8197;nm photolysis of the novel phosphinyl radical HPNCO&#8901;. The &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO complex is extremely unstable, as it undergoes spontaneous isomerization to the lower&#8208;energy isomer &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO through fast quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) with a half&#8208;life of 6.1&#8197;min at 3&#8197;K. Upon further irradiation at 254&#8197;nm, the reverse conversion of &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO to &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO along with dehydrogenation to yield PN was observed. The characterization &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO and &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO with matrix&#8208;isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D, 15N, and 13C isotope labeling and quantum chemical calculations at the XYGJ&#8208;OS/AVTZ level of theory, and the mechanism by hydrogen atom tunneling is consistent with multidimensional instanton theory calculations.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Driven Modular Precision Chemistry of Graphene Using &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for laser&#8208;induced precise 2D&#8208;functionalization of graphene using multifunctional trivalent iodine compounds is developed, allowing for complex and customized molecular engineering of the graphene surface. The tailor&#8208;made and reversible attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties enables programming the surface properties of graphene, paving the way for advanced nanoelectronics.







Abstract
The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning strategy utilizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks is proposed for the rational design of low&#8208;Pt high entropy intermetallic compounds (PtM3 type, where M=transition metal) for the oxygen reduction reaction. The developed Pt(FeCoNiCu)3/C catalyst, featuring small nanoparticle size, exhibits exceptional mass and specific activity, along with significantly enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011&#8197;eV atom&#8722;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (7.92&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish diffussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

         <title>In situ Monitoring of Photocatalysis on Polymeric Carbon Nitride Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes are developed for time&#8208;resolved monitoring of pCN photocatalyzed reaction processes under visible light conditions. This technique allows simultaneous in situ irradiation and monitoring of heterogeneous reactions, which enables the detection of intermediates that are elusive in conventional spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride has attracted significant interest in heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, we report on using carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes for in situ studies of photocatalytic reaction mechanisms. In a first step, we exploited carbon nitride&#8208;coated crimp vials as batch photoreactors for visible photocatalytic fluorinations of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, with moderate to excellent yields and reusability over multiple cycles. Eventually, carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes were used as a photoreactor by coupling them with optical fiber irradiation directly inside the spectrometer. This enabled us to follow the reaction with in situ NMR spectroscopy identifying reactive intermediates otherwise elusive in conventional analyses. The method provides advantages for the study of photocatalytic mechanisms of complex reactions and substantially reduces the need of comparative tests for depicting reaction intermediates and conversion pathways.

         <title>Thin Zinc Electrodes Stabilized with Organobromine&#8208;Partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH Cluster Ions for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During Zn electroplating, BDOL of the organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ion preferentially adsorbs on the Zn surface and the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex part desolvates into ZnO&#8208;dominated Zn compounds, acting as the outer SEI. Subsequently, the formed ZnO induces the polymerization of the adsorbed BDOL, forming a polyether inner layer. Benefiting from this SEI, a stable high&#8208;DOD Zn plating/stripping on the thin Zn electrode is achieved.







Abstract
The utilization of thin zinc (Zn) anodes with a high depth of discharge is an effective strategy to increase the energy density of aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs), but challenged by the poor reversibility of Zn electrode due to the serious Zn&#8208;consuming side reactions at the Zn||electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (BDOL) and methanol (MeOH) as electrolyte additive into aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the as&#8208;formulated electrolyte, BDOL with a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group (&#8722;CH2Br) tends to pair with the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex, leading to the formation of organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ions. During the Zn electrodeposition process, the formed ZnO&#8208;dominated by&#8208;products induce the polymerization of BDOL monomers, which are previously adsorbed on the electrode. As a result, a uniform dual&#8208;layer SEI with ZnO&#8208;dominated outer layer and polyether&#8208;dominated inner layer is built on the surface of Zn electrode. With such an in situ formed dual&#8208;layer SEI, the Zn||Mg0.9Mn3O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O pouch cell using a 10&#8208;um Zn anode (corresponding to a low negative to positive areal capacity ratio of 3.56) successfully operated for 300&#8197;cycles with a high capacity retention of 86&#8201;%, promising a high practical energy density of &gt;120&#8197;Wh/kg (based on the total mass of Zn and Mg0.9Mn3O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O).

With such an in situ formed dual-layer SEI, the Zn||Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O pouch cell using a 10-um Zn anode (corresponding to a low negative to positive areal capacity ratio of 3.56) successfully operated for 300&#8197;cycles with a high capacity retention of 86&#8201;%, promising a high practical energy density of &amp;gt;120&#8197;Wh/kg (based on the total mass of Zn and Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8722;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel monofluorinated phosphate co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), is developed. Unlike traditional C&#8722;F bond fluorination strategies, the P&#8722;F bond can effectively reduce the charge density on the oxygen atom of the P=O bond and lower the LUMO level of DEFP, achieving a unique balance between safety and electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8722;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8722;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8722;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Synergistically Enhances Radiotherapy and Activates STING for Potent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MOF/MSA&#8208;2, leverages high&#8208;Z Hf6 secondary building units for radioenhancement and releases MSA&#8208;2 for sustained STING activation to mediate the regression of colon tumors in mice. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.







Abstract
The activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein by cyclic dinucleotide metabolites plays a critical role in antitumor immunity. However, synthetic STING agonists like 4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;dimethoxybenzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoic acid (MSA&#8208;2) exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetics and fail to sustain STING activation in tumors for effective antitumor responses. Here, we report the design of MOF/MSA&#8208;2, a bifunctional MSA&#8208;2 conjugated nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Hf6 secondary building units (SBUs) and hexakis(4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene bridging ligands, for potent cancer radio&#8208;immunotherapy. By leveraging the high&#8208;Z properties of the Hf6 SBUs, the MOF enhances the therapeutic effect of X&#8208;ray radiation and elicits potent immune stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 further enhances radiotherapeutic effects of X&#8208;rays by enabling sustained STING activation and promoting the infiltration and activation of immune cells in the tumors. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 plus low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation elicits strong STING activation and potent tumor regression, and when combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Programmable DNA&#8208;Encoded Pre&#8208;PROTACs for Cell&#8208;Selective and Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phototunable miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform is developed to achieve on&#8208;demand activation and termination of targeted protein degradation in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. This modular scaffold capitalizes on the programmability of DNA assembly for dynamic regulation of diverse miRiaTACs for enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have accelerated drug development; however, some challenges still exist owing to their lack of tumor selectivity and on&#8208;demand protein degradation. Here, we developed a miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform that enables the on&#8208;demand activation and termination of target degradation in a cell type&#8208;specific manner. Using miRNA&#8208;21 as a model, we engineered DNA hairpins labeled with JQ&#8208;1 and pomalidomide and facilitated the modular assembly of DNA&#8208;encoded pre&#8208;PROTACs through a hybridization chain reaction. This configuration promoted the selective polyubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 upon miR&#8208;21 initiation, highlighting significant tumor selectivity and minimal systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the platform incorporates photolabile groups, enabling the precise optical control of pre&#8208;PROTACs during DNA assembly/disassembly, mitigating the risk of excessive protein degradation. Additionally, by introducing a secondary ligand targeting CDK6, these pre&#8208;PROTACs were used as a modular scaffold for the programmable assembly of active miRiaTACs containing two different warheads in exact stoichiometry, enabling orthogonal multitarget degradation. The integration of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy through an upconversion nanosystem further enhanced the efficacy of the platform with potent in vivo anticancer activity. We anticipate that miRiaTAC represents a significant intersection between dynamic DNA nanotechnology and PROTAC, potentially expanding the versatility of PROTAC toolkit for cancer therapy.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Fluorosurfactants for Droplet&#8208;Based in vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of ten non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment bonded to a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment of various hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal interfacial tensions. A perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water microdroplet formulation allowed for in vivo mechanical force measurements and increased sensitivity was observed, expanding the relevance of this microdroplet platform.







Abstract
Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension (IFT) to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions). We developed non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer low IFTs between a fluorocarbon oil (HFE&#8208;7700) and water. The synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66&#8197;kDa with various hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&#8722;1. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co&#8208;introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG5PFPE1 surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.

         <title>Dinitrogen Reduction and Functionalization by a Siloxide Supported Thulium&#8208;Potassium Complex for the Formation of Ammonia or Hydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxide ligands promote dinitrogen (N2) reduction by Tm(II) ions yielding an N22&#8722; bridged complex that can be further reduced to yield a complex showing a rare triply reduced N23&#8722; radical bound by two Tm and three K cations, that facilitate N2 functionalization by electrophiles (H+, Me+) and N&#8722;C bond formation to yield an Me2N22&#8722; complex.







Abstract
The dinitrogen (N2) chemistry of lanthanides remains less developed compared to the d&#8208;block metals and lanthanide&#8208;promoted N2 functionalization chemistry in well&#8208;defined lanthanide complexes remains elusive. Here we report the synthesis and characterization (SQUID, EPR, DFT, X&#8208;Ray) of the siloxide supported heterobimetallic (Tm/K) complexes [{KTm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1) and [K3{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (2). Complex 2 provides a rare example of a metal complex of the triply reduced N23&#8722; radical. The structure of 2 differs from the few previously reported N23&#8722; complexes as it presents two Tm and three K cations binding the N23&#8722; radical, facilitating N2 functionalization. Notably, the K3Tm2&#8208;bound N23&#8722; moiety reacts with excess H+ to form NH4Cl in 18&#8201;% yield, and with MeOTf at room temperature to yield the dimethyl hydrazido complex [K2{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;(CH3)NN(CH3))] (3). Protonolysis of 3 yields MeHN&#8722;NMeH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HCl in 18&#8201;% yield.

         <title>The Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 100&#8197;years after Staudinger's seminal reports on the reaction of iminophosphoranes with aldehydes, an alternative path, the so&#8208;called &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction&#8221; has been uncovered. We describe the reaction of bulky azides with PMe3 in the presence of aromatic aldehydes to give triazabutadienes (TBDs). This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is a versatile route towards TBDs, tolerating various aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms into conjugated organic molecules is an important strategy to tune their reactivity and physical properties. In this realm triazabutadienes (TBDs) of the general from R2C=N&#8722;N=NR&#8217; are an interesting class of compounds, however, general synthetic protocols for their generation are limited. Based on the serendipitous finding that the sterically encumbered azide Mes*N3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2) reacted with PMe3 in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde to form a TBD, we now report on the &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig&#8221; reaction. This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is shown to be a versatile tool for the synthesis of a variety of TBDs, tolerating a wide range of aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners. The preference for azide&#8208;Wittig, rather than aza&#8208;Wittig reactivity was rationalized using computational methods. This study shows how kinetic control can significantly alter the reaction pathway, thereby switching from an aza&#8208;Wittig to an azide&#8208;Wittig regime.

         <title>Are Hydroxyl Radicals Spontaneously Generated in Unactivated Water Droplets?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous reactions of water in either highly charged nanodrops formed by electrospray ionization, or less highly charged microdroplets formed by a vibrating mesh screen nebulizer were investigated. No evidence for ionized water dimer, nor oxidation products of the radical scavengers caffeine or melatonin was observed over a wide range of droplet size, net charge, and lifetime, indicating that water is stable at the surface of unactivated water droplets.







Abstract
Spontaneous ionization/breakup of water at the surface of aqueous droplets has been reported with evidence ranging from formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, indicated by ions at m/z 36 attributed to OH&#8901;&#8208;H3O+ or (H2O&#8208;OH2)+&#8901; as well as oxidation products of radical scavengers in mass spectra of water droplets formed by pneumatic nebulization. Here, aqueous droplets are formed both by nanoelectrospray, which produces highly charged nanodrops with initial diameters ~100&#8197;nm, and a vibrating mesh nebulizer, which produces 2&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m droplets that are initially less highly charged. The lifetimes of these droplets range from 10s of &#956;s to 560&#8197;ms and the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios span ~100&#8208;fold range. No ions at m/z 36 are detected with pure water, nor are significant oxidation products for the two radical scavengers that were previously reported to be formed in high abundance. These and other results indicate that prior conclusions about spontaneous hydroxyl radical formation in unactivated water droplets are not supported by the evidence and that water appears to be stable at droplet surfaces over a wide range of droplet size, charge and lifetime.

         <title>[19]Starphene: Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis Towards the Largest Starphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a star&#8208;shaped polyarene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches is described. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface chemistry. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Photochemically Triggered and Autonomous Oscillatory pH&#8208;Modulated Transient Assembly/Disassembly of DNA Microdroplet Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable or oscillatory pH changes induced by a photoacid or Landolt oscillatory reaction are applied to induce the transient assembly/disassembly of microdroplet protocells. Cyclic and autonomous formation/depletion of the microdroplets following the rhythm of pH changes are demonstrated.







Abstract
The assembly of pH&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based, phase&#8208;separated microdroplets (MDs) coacervates, consisting of frameworks composed of Y&#8208;shaped nucleic acid modules crosslinked by pH&#8208;responsive strands, is introduced. The phase&#8208;separated MDs reveal dynamic pH&#8208;stimulated switchable or oscillatory transient depletion and reformation. In one system, a photoisomerizable merocyanine/spiropyran photoacid is used for the light&#8208;induced pH switchable modulation of the reaction medium between the values pH=6.0&#8211;4.4. The dynamic transient photochemically&#8208;induced switchable depletion/reformation of phase&#8208;separated MDs, follows the rhythm of pH changes in solution. In a second system, the Landolt oscillatory reaction mixture pH&#8197;7.5&#8594;4.2&#8594;7.5 is applied to stimulate the oscillatory depletion/reformation of the MDs. The autonomous dynamic oscillation of the assembly/disassembly of the MDs follows the oscillating pH rhythm of the reaction medium.

         <title>Germylene Mediated Reductive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Coupling of an Isocyanide and its Device Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive coupling of perimidine based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene and 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide afforded a highly colored and luminescent bis&#8208;spirogerma species with unprecedented simultaneous C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling. The compound is also successfully integrated as a hole transport material in a solar cell.







Abstract
We have demonstrated a unique reductive coupling of 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide, facilitated by a perimidine&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene (NHGe), which yields a bis&#8208;spirogerma compound featuring simultaneous C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation. This reaction, which leads to the oxidation of germanium from +2 to +4, represents a significant departure from previously documented isocyanide&#8208;germylene interactions. The product exhibits extensive conjugation across its bicyclic C4Ge2N2 framework, conferring distinct photophysical properties, including prominent orange luminescence in both solution and solid states. The photophysical properties are supported by the TD&#8208;DFT calculations confirming an n&#8594;&#960;* transition. The potential application of this compound in optoelectronic devices, particularly as a hole transport layer in PbS quantum dot solar cells, is also explored, with promising preliminary results.

         <title>Access to Alkenyl Cyclobutanols by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantio&#8208;Selective syn&#8208;Hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig Cyclization of Alkynones</title>

         <dc:description>
Override the intrinsic preference of regioselectivity. An enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones is reported to access alkenyl cyclobutanols. A carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation step is the key to override the intrinsic electronic effect guided regioselectivity. The products are demonstrated to readily advance to enantioenriched three&#8208;dimensional bioisosteres.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of (spiro)cyclobutane derivatives poses significant challenges yet holds promising applications for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. We report here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones to synthesize alkenyl cyclobutanols with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, delivering a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing rigid (spiro)carbocycle skeletons in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield and 98.5&#8201;:&#8201;1.5 er). The synthetic utility is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into fused spiro molecules. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is initiated by an active Ni&#8722;H species, with carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation as the key for regioselective control. This catalytic method provides a general solution for regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and represents an efficient reaction pattern for assembling highly strained enantioenriched bioisosteres.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of the NIR&#8208;II photosensitizer H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE and the ROS&#8208;responsive copper ionophore DTC&#8208;BA enables targeted activation of cuproptosis in oral carcinoma. Upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation, DTC chelates Cu2+ from H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE to form Cu(DTC)2, which is reduced by endogenous FDX1 to produce Cu+ and promote cuproptosis. The addition of 5&#8208;Azacytidine further replenished cellular FDX1, sustaining cuproptosis and enhancing both tumor suppression and antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.

         <title>Unlocking Mechanism of Anion and Cation Interaction on Ion Conduction of Polymer Based Electrolyte in Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing polyesters with different electron withdrawing groups (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to cation is the reason for fast ion conduction of polymer based electrolyte.







Abstract
Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li+ is critical for high Li+ transfer number (

tLi+

 ${t_{Li}^+ }$



) and ionic conductivity of electrolyte. As a result, poly (2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (PTFM) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) shows an ionic conductivity of 0.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a 

tLi+

 ${{t}_{Li}^{+}}$



 of 0.85, much higher than those of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) without EWG. Moreover, PTFM based GPE shows excellent flame retardancy property. Li||PTFM||NCM811 batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 5.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 show stable cycles of 5&#8197;times to that of Li||PMMA||NCM811. Moreover, the assembled graphite||PTFM||NCM811 pouch cell shows a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. This work clarifies the mechanism of cation/anion interaction on ionic conductivity of GPE, which is important to develop high&#8208;performance devices with good safety and flexibility.

         <title>Tunable Isometric Donor&#8208;Acceptor Wurster&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymeric materials featuring wide&#8208;ranging structural control and modularity. The synthesis of a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor Wurster building blocks enabled the formation of isostructural, photoactive COFs with distinct optical features in thin films. These COFs were further applied for photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer remarkable versatility, combining ordered structures, high porosity, and tailorable functionalities in nanoscale reaction spaces. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of isostructural, photoactive Wurster&#8208;type COFs achieved by manipulating the chemical and electronic nature of the Wurster aromatic amine building blocks. A series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) Wurster building block molecules was synthesized by incorporating heteroaromatic acceptors with varying strengths between triphenylamine donor groups. These tailored building blocks were integrated into a 2D COF scaffold, resulting in highly crystalline structures and similar morphologies across all COFs. Remarkably, this structural uniformity was also achieved in the synthesis of homogeneous and oriented thin films. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence revealed a tunable red&#8208;shift in film emission exceeding 100&#8197;nm, demonstrating effective manipulation of their optical properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies exhibited a doubled current density (8.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;VRHE) for the COF with the strongest acceptor unit. These findings highlight the potential of Wurster D&#8208;A&#8208;D COFs in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and pave the way for further exploration of chemical functionality&#8208;reactivity&#8208;property relationships in this promising class of photoactive materials.

         <title>Enhancing Molecular&#8208;Level Biological Monitoring with a Smart Self&#8208;Assembling 19F&#8208;Labeled Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembling 19F NMR probe disassembles upon interacting with various nucleotides in physiological conditions, activating the 19F signals and producing unique signatures for each analyte. This technique allows analysis in complex mixtures and facilitates real&#8208;time, in situ monitoring of enzymatic processes for quality control and assessment of inhibitory effects.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of molecular transformations is crucial for advancements in biotechnology. In this study, we introduce a novel self&#8208;assembling 19F&#8208;labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that disassembles upon interaction with various nucleotides. This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;Dense Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through electrolyte design to simultaneously increase the Coulombic efficiency on the graphite anode side and enhance the oxidation stability on the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) Prussian blue analogue cathode side, stable, low&#8208;cost, and energy&#8208;dense PIBs can be realized with specific energy and cycling stability comparable to the contemporary LiFePO4&#8208;based LIBs and superior to emerging SIBs.







Abstract
Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14&#8201;% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94&#8201;%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61&#8197;V with a specific energy of 316.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1&#8722;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Mechanochemical Conditions for Intramolecular N&#8722;O Couplings via Rhodium Nitrenoids Generated from N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides under rhodium catalysis are presented. The solvent&#8208;free method proceeds via rhodium nitrenoids and produces unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in a short reaction time with up to 98&#8201;% yield. Potential synthetic applications of the resulting five&#8208;membered heterocycles as nitrene precursors are demonstrated by reacting a representative compound with DMSO under heat or blue light.







Abstract
Starting from N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides, mechanochemically generated rhodium nitrenoids undergo intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings to provide unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The cyclization proceeds efficiently with a catalyst loading of only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the presence of phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) as oxidant. Neither an inert atmosphere nor additional heating is required in this solvent&#8208;free procedure. Under heat or blue light, the newly formed five&#8208;membered heterocycles function as nitrene precursors reacting with sulfoxides as exemplified by the imidation of dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Switchable Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane as Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing topologically chiral [2]catenane as the chiral platform and switching scaffold, the first stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter with |gPL| reaching up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 was successfully constructed. It further serves as an excellent emitter layer for the fabrication of efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs).







Abstract
Aiming at the fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high dissymmetry factors (gEL) and color purity through the employment of novel chiral source, topologically chiral [2]catenanes were first utilized as the key chiral skeleton to construct novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Impressively, the efficient chirality induction and unique switchable feature of topologically chiral [2]catenane not only lead to a high |gPL| value up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 but also facilitate in situ dynamic switching of the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the resultant topologically chiral emitters exhibit a narrow FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.6&#8201;%, and CPEL with |gEL| of 2.1&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates the successful construction of the first CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters based on topological chirality with the highest |gPL| among the reported CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters and excellent device performance to the best of our knowledge.

&lt;p&gt;By employing topologically chiral [2]catenane as the chiral platform and switching scaffold, the first stimuli-responsive topologically chiral multiple-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitter with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;| reaching up to 1.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was successfully constructed. It further serves as an excellent emitter layer for the fabrication of efficient circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming at the fabrication of circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) with high dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;) and color purity through the employment of novel chiral source, topologically chiral [2]catenanes were first utilized as the key chiral skeleton to construct novel multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters. Impressively, the efficient chirality induction and unique switchable feature of topologically chiral [2]catenane not only lead to a high |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;| value up to 1.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; but also facilitate in situ dynamic switching of the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Furthermore, the solution-processed CP-OLEDs based on the resultant topologically chiral emitters exhibit a narrow FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.6&#8201;%, and CPEL with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| of 2.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This study demonstrates the successful construction of the first CP-MR-TADF emitters based on topological chirality with the highest |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;| among the reported CP-MR-TADF emitters and excellent device performance to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, it endowed the MR-TADF emitter with distinctive switchable CPL performances, thus providing a novel design strategy as well as a promising platform for developing intelligent CP-OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Growth of Highly Emissive Manganese Halide Microrods for Dual&#8208;Mode Low&#8208;Loss Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese(II) halide microrod crystals (TPS2MnCl4) are synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Owing to their high PLQY, smooth crystal surface, and negligible self&#8208;absorption, these TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited not only for optical waveguides but can serve as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in a single crystal.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structured lead&#8208;free metal halides have recently attracted widespread attention due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and negligible self&#8208;absorption, showing enormous potential as optical waveguides towards miniaturized photonic devices. However, due to the great difficulty in growth of rod&#8208;like nano/micro&#8208;sized morphologies, such applications have been less explored. Herein, a new&#8208;type emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese (II) halide crystal (TPS2MnCl4, TPS=C18H15S, triphenylsulfonium) in the form of microrods is synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Due to a combination of attractive features such as a high PLQY of 86&#8201;%, negligible self&#8208;absorption and smooth crystal surface, TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited for use in optical waveguide with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 1.20&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, superior to that of most organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide hybrids, organic materials, polymers and metal nanoclusters to the best of our knowledge. Importantly, TPS2MnCl4 microrods can further work as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in one single crystal. In addition, TPS2MnCl4 microrods also display remarkable performance in lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their distinct optical properties and commendable stability.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric nitrogen&#8208;oxidized Tr&#246;ger's base macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. These rigid, electron&#8208;deficient cavities exhibit excellent chiral discrimination for a wide range of guests, achieving a record&#8208;breaking enantioselectivity of 41.







Abstract
Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8722;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.

         <title>Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters Via a &#8220;Reserve&#8208;Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and tough thermoplastic materials are made available from biodegradable, naturally abundant lactides and lactones through facile polymer synthesis and processing, which features the well&#8208;defined segmented crystallizable chain architecture as the key to their broadly tunable mechanical properties controlled by block periodicity.







Abstract
Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low&#8208;strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi&#8208;crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain&#8208;induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy&#8208;dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape&#8208;memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios. This work and the &#8220;reserve&#8208;release&#8221; crystallization strategy herein highlight the double crystalline multiblock chain architecture as a potential avenue towards reconciling the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off in thermoplastic elastomers and can possibly be extended to other biodegradable building blocks to deliver functional materials with diverse mechanical performances.

         <title>Chiral Polar Bifunctional Polyimide Enantiomers for Asymmetric Photo&#8208; and Piezo&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polar polyimide (PI) enantiomers are developed as novel bifunctional nano&#8208;catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The chiral PI catalysts exhibit the chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic H2O2 production, with tunable selectivity between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light in different bands, and also present remarkable chiral piezocatalytic preference, which achieves asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and chiral tyrosines conversion into dihydroxyphenylalanine and dityrosine under ultrasonic vibration.







Abstract
Chiral catalysts for asymmetric catalysis represent a crucial research focus in chemistry and materials science. However, a few cases about chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalysts primarily focus on plasmonic noble metals. Particularly, developing chiral nano&#8208;catalysts that can be driven by mechanical energy remains in the blank stage. Herein, organic polymer&#8208;based enantiomers, chiral polar polyimide (PI) microspheric nano&#8208;assembly are synthesized as novel bifunctional catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The PI catalyst enantiomers present enantioselectivity towards left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, demonstrating chiral&#8208;dependent H2O2 photoproduction. Interestingly, enantioselectivity of the catalyst reverses under irradiation of different bands, presenting tunability in the interaction between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light. For the first time, enantioselective piezocatalytic behavior is demonstrated by the chiral polar PI catalysts. They show remarkable chiral preference for asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and enantioselective conversion of tyrosine substrates under ultrasonic vibration. The findings provide a new perspective into exploring metal&#8208;free chiral catalysts and their asymmetric catalysis applications across multiple energy forms.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol with O2 over Photoinduced Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich WO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) can be facilely generated and finely confined adjacent to the reductive sites of WO3 via a gentle photoetching approach. Such photoinduced OVs are advantageous for photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with O2, matching well with the charge carrier dynamics to immediately capture the photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites to activate the adsorbed O2.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic conversion of benzene to phenol with molecular oxygen (O2) is a green alternative to the traditional synthesis. The key is to find an effective photocatalyst to do the trick. Defect engineering of semiconductors with oxygen vacancies (OVs) is an emerging strategy for catalyst fabrication. OVs can trap electrons to promote charge separation and serving as adsorption sites for O2 activation. However, the randomly distribution of OVs on the semiconductor surface often results in mismatching the charge carrier dynamics under irradiation, thus failing to fulfill the unique advantages of OVs for photoredox functions. Herein, we demonstrate that abundant OVs can be facilely generated and precisely located adjacent to the reductive sites on reducible oxide semiconductors such as tungsten oxide (WO3) via a simple photochemistry strategy. Such photoinduced OVs are well suited for photocatalytic benzene oxidation with O2 as they readily capture photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites of WO3 to activate adsorbed O2. The oxygen&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling experiments further confirm that the OVs also facilitate the integration of oxygen atoms from O2 into phenol, revealing in detail the pathway for photocatalytic benzene hydroxylation. This study demonstrates that the photochemistry approach is an appealing strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance OVs&#8208;rich photocatalysts for solar&#8208;induced chemical conversion.

         <title>Self&#8208;promoted Controlled Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization via Side Chain&#8208;mediated Proton Transfer for the Synthesis of Tertiary Amine&#8208;pendant Polypeptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This is the first report of the direct synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids by self&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant NCAs.







Abstract
Proton transfer is essential in virtually all biochemical processes, with enzymes facilitating this transfer by optimizing the proximity and orientation of reactants through site&#8208;specific hydrogen bonds. Proton transfer is also crucial in the rate&#8208;determining step for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs), widely used to prepare various peptidomimetic materials. This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate the rate of chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This moiety enables hydrogen bond formation between the incoming NCA and the polymer amino growing end. The tertiary amine side chain of the NCA forms a proton shuttle, via a less constrained transition state, to facilitate the proton transfer process. Moreover, the tertiary amine side chains enable the precipitation of NCA monomers through in situ protonation during the monomer synthesis. This greatly facilitates the synthesis of these unreported monomers, allowing the direct controlled synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids. This side chain&#8208;promoted polymerization has rarely been reported. Additionally, the tertiary amine side chains, as widely used functional groups, endow the polymers with unique properties including pH&#8208; and thermo&#8208;responsiveness, tunable pKas, and siRNA transfection capability. The self&#8208;promoted synthesis, facile monomer preparation, and attractive properties make tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids promising materials for various applications.

         <title>Cu&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Catalysts Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays on Copper Foam for Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterometallic doping strategy was developed to fabricate a bi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derived array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF) for converting nitrogen oxides species coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids into amino acids, which presenting a high selectivity (89&#8201;%) and excellent Faraday efficiency (65.9&#8201;%) towards glycine electrosynthesis due to the synergistic effect between Bi and Cu.







Abstract
Glycine as one of the most abundant amino acids in human proteins, with extensive applications in both life and industry, is conventionally synthesized through complex procedures or toxic feedstocks. In this study, we present a facile and benign electrochemical pathway for synthesis of glycine through reductive coupling of glyoxylic acid and nitrate over a copper&#8208;bismuth bimetal catalyst derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF). Remarkably, Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF achieves a fantastic selectivity of 89&#8201;%, corresponding a high Faraday efficiency of 65.9&#8201;%. From control experiments, the introduction of Bi caused the binding energy of Cu shift to a lower state, which leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of key intermediate hydroxylamine rather than ammonia product, facilitating the formation of oxime and providing additional sites for subsequent hydrogenation reaction on the way to glycine. Moreover, the derivation of MOF arrays ensures the effective dispersion of Bi and enhances the stability of Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF. This innovative approach not only presents sustainable pathways for the production of value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds utilizing readily available carbon and nitrogen sources, but also provides novel insights into the design of multistage structural catalysts for sequential reactions.

         <title>Modulating Pore Wall Chemistry Empowers Sonodynamic Activity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Pro&#8208;Oxidative Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pore wall chemistry modulation approach is proposed for imparting sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions composed of inert bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Among isoreticular counterparts, significant sonodynamic performance is demonstrated only in the heterojunctions with vinyl groups decorated on the pore walls of COFs, which is attributed to the accelerated separation and transfer of charge carriers.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered growing interest in the field of biomedicine; however, their application in sonodynamic therapy remains underexplored due to limited understanding of their intrinsic activity and structure&#8211;property relationships. Here, we present a pore wall chemistry modulation strategy for empowering sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF heterojunctions through in&#8197;situ growth of COFs on bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets (B&#8197;NSs). Compared to the negligible sonodynamic effects observed in the pristine B&#8197;NSs, the 2D heterojunction with vinyl&#8208;decorated COF pore walls demonstrates a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in sonocatalytic singlet oxygen generation. This performance also significantly outperforms that of isoreticular COFs functionalized with methoxy or non&#8208;substituted groups. Mechanistic studies reveal that the vinyl groups in the B@COF (BC) heterojunction facilitate the separation and transfer of charge carriers while also enhancing the adsorption of oxygen molecules. Furthermore, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) loading into the porous COFs boosts the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor nanotherapy via sonocatalytic dual oxidative species generation. These findings underscore the critical role of pore wall chemistry in modulating the sonocatalytic properties of COFs, and advance the development of COF&#8208;based sonosensitizers for pro&#8208;oxidative applications.

Chemical bonds in dye molecules are vibrationally excited by a narrowband mid&#8208;IR pulse and upconverted by a synchronized near&#8208;IR pulse. Doubly excited molecules emit fluorescence encoding mid&#8208;IR information.

         <title>Nucleophilic Fluoride Anion Delivery from Triazacyclononane&#8208;Supported Molecular Ca&#8211;F Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane scaffold is employed for the synthesis of dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes. A bridging Ca&#8208;F&#8722;Ca motif is confirmed crystallographically and nucleophilic fluoride delivery demonstrated in the formation of a range of E&#8722;F bonds. The less nucleophilic anionic O&#8208;donor set reduces the extent of ligand&#8208;centered side reactions compared to related amide&#8208;derived systems.







Abstract
The major source of fluoride, namely calcium difluoride (CaF2), is derived from the mineral fluorspar. Recent advances in the activation of CaF2 via mechanochemical methods have inspired investigation of the fundamental properties of Ca&#8211;F bonds in molecular complexes. However, the paucity of well&#8208;defined molecular Ca&#8211;F&#8208;containing complexes undermines systematic understanding of the factors governing nucleophilic fluoride delivery. Here we report the use of a multidentate bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) scaffold for the formation of well&#8208;defined Ca&#8211;F complexes and demonstrate their capabilities in fluoride delivery. Key to this synthesis is a desymmetrization step carried out on the TACN ligand within the Ca coordination sphere. A series of stable anionic dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes has then been accessed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (critically by 19F NMR) and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Nucleophilic fluoride delivery can be used to generate C&#8722;F, Si&#8211;F and S&#8722;F bonds, with a notable advance over amide&#8208;derived ligand scaffolds being the reduced extent of side reactions derived from competing attack on the electrophile by the less nucleophilic O&#8208;donor anionic ligand set.

         <title>Marine Amoebae&#8208;Inspired Salting Hydrogels to Reconfigure Anisotropy for Reprogrammable Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to osmotic pressure, marine amoebae swell in freshwater and deswell in high salinity seawater. Inspired by this, protonation/deprotonation transition was synergized with osmotic pressure to allow polyampholyte hydrogels to swell&#8208;reswell&#8208;deswell upon successive immersion in HCl/NaCl solution and water. Swelling&#8208;reswelling&#8208;deswelling of reconfigurable patterned zones enables reprogrammable shape morphing of hydrogels.







Abstract
Reprogrammable shape morphing is ubiquitous in living beings and highly crucial for them to move in normal situations, even to survive under dangerous conditions. There is increasing interest in using asymmetric hydrogel structures to understand and mimic living beings&#8217; shape morphing upon an external trigger in a controlled way. However, these asymmetric or heterogeneous configurations cannot be further modified once the polymer hydrogels are prepared. Therefore, it is a great challenge to achieve reprogrammable shape morphing using the existing hydrogels. Inspired by marine amoebae, which transform into several different morphologies according to the various external salt concentrations, a new strategy is developed for salting hydrogels to reconfigure their anisotropy toward reprogrammable shape morphing. Polyampholyte hydrogels with equal stoichiometric COO&#8722; and N+(CH3)3 groups were first swollen in HCl/NaCl solution. After being then transferred into water, they first swollen again by water uptake driven by the osmotic pressure, and then were spontaneously deswollen due to increase in internal pH and dialysis of ions leading to deprotonation of COOH to COO&#8722; and regeneration of COO&#8722;/N+(CH3)3 electrostatic attraction. This work provides a novel strategy to reconfigure anisotropy of hydrogel soft actuators and to open up an avenue for reprogrammable shape morphing.

A facile design strategy for exploring robust folded luminescent molecules using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole to bridge planar electron donors and acceptors is reported by Zujin Zhao et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202414488). The generated molecules possess a regular sandwich&#8208;structured confirmation like a rigid folded mortise and tenon structure, and display prominent thermally activated delayed fluorescence. They can function efficiently as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Unclicking the Click: A Depolymerizable Clicked Polymer via Two Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major drawback with polymers synthesized via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition is its inability to undergo depolymerization. We addressed this limitation by replacing the triazolyl&#8208;linkage with the isosteric triazolinyl&#8208;linkage via topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) chemistry. The latter underwent denitrogenation to form hydrolyzable imine&#8208;linked polymer. As a proof of concept, we have hydrolyzed the imine&#8208;linked polymer, quantitatively obtaining monomer equivalents. This result enlists triazoline&#8208;linked polymers as depolymerizable polymers.







Abstract
We report here a clicked polymer that can be depolymerized by a declicking reaction. A designed dipeptide monomer, upon heating its crystals, underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition polymerization to form a triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, which upon further heating, underwent a remarkable SCSC denitrogenation, resulting in an imine&#8208;linked polymer quantitatively. As both the TEAC polymerization and the denitrogenation occurred in SCSC fashion, the structures of the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer and the imine&#8208;linked polymer could be determined at atomic resolution by SCXRD. Acid hydrolysis of the imine&#8208;linked polymer leads to quantitative depolymerization, yielding a dipeptide, showcasing the degradability and depolymerizability of such polymers. This solid&#8208;state click polymerization and denitrogenation yielding depolymerizable polymer is attractive over the usual click polymers that cannot be unclicked.

         <title>Energy Dissipation and Toughening of Covalent Networks via a Sacrificial Conformation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the concept of sacrificial conformation, demonstrating that &#946;&#8208;CD act as sacrificial conformation, enabling energy dissipation through force&#8208;induced conformational changes and resulting in a significant enhancement of mechanical performance. Furthermore, we elucidated the microscale force&#8208;responsive nature of &#946;&#8208;CD through CoGEF simulations and investigated their practical role in macroscopic materials using stress relaxation approach on a strain&#8208;controlled rotational rheometer.







Abstract
Covalent polymer networks find wide utility in diverse engineering applications owing to their desirable stiffness and resilience. However, the rigid covalent chemical structure between crosslinking points imposes limitations on enhancing their toughness. Although the incorporation of sacrificial chemical bonds has shown promise in improving toughness through energy dissipation, composite networks struggle to maintain both rapid recovery and stiffness. Consequently, a significant challenge persists in achieving a covalent network that combines high strength, stiffness, toughness, and fast recovery performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sacrificial structure termed &#8220;sacrificial conformation.&#8221; In this approach, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is covalently embedded into the network skeleton as the sacrificial conformation element. Compared to traditional covalent networks (LCN), well&#8208;designed cyclodextrin&#8208;embedded covalent network (CCN) exhibit a 100&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus and a 60&#8208;fold increase in toughness. Importantly, CCN maintains excellent elasticity, ensuring swift recovery after deformation. This sacrificial conformational strategy enables efficient energy dissipation without necessitating the rupture of chemical bonds, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. This advancement holds great promise for the design and fabrication of advanced elastomers and hydrogels with superior mechanical properties and dynamic behavior.

         <title>A Mechanical Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Stiffens Tumor Cells to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI), composed of synthetic cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids, can overcome the mechanical immune checkpoint by stiffening the tumor cells for enhanced tumor suppression. MICI fuses CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane to deplete the cholesterol from the plasma membrane, thereby improving NK and T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor effects.







Abstract
Tumor progression is associated with tumor&#8208;cell softening. Improving the stiffness of the tumor cells can make them more vulnerable to lymphocyte&#8208;mediated attack. Tumor cell membranes typically exhibit higher cholesterol levels than normal cells, making tumor cells soft. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI) formulated by cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids. Through fusing CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane using a fusogenic liposome formulation, the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is reduced due to the specific host&#8211;guest interactions between CD lipid and cholesterol. As a result, tumor cells are stiffened, and the activation of lymphocytes (including NK and cytotoxic effector T cells) is improved when contacting the stiffened tumor cells, characterized by robust degranulation and effector cytokine production. Notably, this treatment has negligible influence on the infiltration and proliferation of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, confirming that the enhanced antitumor efficacy should result from activating a specific number of lymphocytes caused by direct regulation of the tumor cell stiffness. The combination of MICIs and clinical immunotherapies enhances the lymphocyte&#8208;mediated antitumor effects in two tumor mouse models, including breast cancer and melanoma. Our research also reveals an unappreciated mechanical dimension to lymphocyte activation.

         <title>Suppressing Energy Migration via Antiparallel Spin Alignment in One&#8208;Dimensional Mn2+ Halide Magnets with High Luminescence Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain could effectively suppress the energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, resulting in a low nonradiative transition rate and a high photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Photoexcited energy migration is prone to causing luminescence quenching in Mn2+ luminescent materials, presenting a formidable challenge for optoelectronic applications. Although various strategies and mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the role of spin alignment between adjacent Mn2+ ions has remained largely unexamined. In this study, we have elucidated the influence of spin alignment on energy migration within the one&#8208;dimensional Mn2+&#8208;metal halide compound (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) through variable&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic&#8208;optical spectroscopy. This investigation was conducted with reference to (CH6N3)2MnCl4 (GUA) with isolated [Mn3Cl12]6&#8722; trimers and Cd2+&#8208;doped TMMC. The spin order in TMMC below approximately 55&#8197;K is demonstrated by the disorder&#8208;order transition observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility. This finding is further corroborated by the negligible shift in the temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent emission peaks, a consequence of magnetic saturation. Our results indicate that the antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain in TMMC effectively suppresses energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, thereby reducing nonradiative transitions and enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). This research casts new light on the potential for developing high&#8208;performance Mn2+&#8208;doped phosphors for optoelectronic and spin&#8208;photonic applications, offering insights into the manipulation of spin and energy dynamics in these materials.

         <title>Enhancement of NIR&#8208;II Emission of Er3+ by Doping Fe3+ in Double Perovskites: Multimode Luminescence for Versatile Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe3+,Er3+ co&#8208;doped double perovskite material has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including highly efficient NIR luminescence and multimode controllable luminescence. These findings highlight the immense potential in versatile photoelectric applications including optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and NIR imaging, and provide valuable insights into the modification of luminescent properties by doping transition metal ions.







Abstract
Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near&#8208;infrared range. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency multimode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f&#8208;4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multimode luminescence and enhance the second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue&#8208;excitable (450&#8197;nm) NIR&#8208;II emission around 1541&#8197;nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7&#8197;times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 22.5&#8201;%. This enhancement enables innovative applications such as two&#8208;dimensional information encryption by the multi&#8208;channel cooperative responses and improved NIR imaging. The study highlights the potential of Fe3+ doping in optimizing absorption and multimode luminescence in perovskites, opening avenues for advanced applications in blue&#8208;excitable NIR light emitting diodes (LEDs), thermometer, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and NIR imaging.

         <title>Ultrafast Tailoring Amorphous Zn0.25V2O5 with Precision&#8208;Engineered Artificial Atomic&#8208;Layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 cathode, with an atomic&#8208;layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 coating, is ultrafast and efficiently synthesized through a colloidal chemical strategy to achieve superior AZIB performance. The amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO and MoS2 artificial interphase synergistically provide more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics while effectively suppressing structural degradation and V&#8208;dissolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes.







Abstract
Vanadium (V)&#8208;based oxides as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) still encounter challenges such as sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and V&#8208;dissolution, thus leading to severe capacity fading and limited life span. Here, we designed an ultrafast and facile colloidal chemical synthesis strategy based on crystalline Zn0.25V2O5 (c&#8208;ZVO) to successfully prepare a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 core@shell heterostructures, where atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 uniformly coats on the surface of amorphous a&#8208;ZVO. The tailored amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO provides more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, thus significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Meanwhile, as an efficient artificial cathode electrolyte interphase, the precision&#8208;engineered atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 with semi&#8208;metallic 1T&#8242; phase not only contributes to improved electron transport but also effectively inhibits the V&#8208;dissolution of a&#8208;ZVO. Therefore, the prepared a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 and conceptually validated a&#8208;V2O5@MoS2 derived from commercial c&#8208;V2O5 exhibit excellent cycling stability at an ultralow current density (0.05&#8197;A g&#8722;1) while maintaining good rate capability and capacity retention. This research achievement provides a new effective strategy for various amorphous cathode designs for AZIBs with superior performance.

The amorphous structure of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-ZVO and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; artificial interphase synergistically provide more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly enhancing the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics while effectively suppressing structural degradation and V-dissolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanadium (V)-based oxides as cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) still encounter challenges such as sluggish Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics and V-dissolution, thus leading to severe capacity fading and limited life span. Here, we designed an ultrafast and facile colloidal chemical synthesis strategy based on crystalline Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;c-&lt;/i&gt;ZVO) to successfully prepare &lt;i&gt;a-&lt;/i&gt;ZVO@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core@shell heterostructures, where atomic-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uniformly coats on the surface of amorphous &lt;i&gt;a-&lt;/i&gt;ZVO. The tailored amorphous structure of &lt;i&gt;a-&lt;/i&gt;ZVO provides more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, thus significantly enhancing the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Meanwhile, as an efficient artificial cathode electrolyte interphase, the precision-engineered atomic-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with semi-metallic 1T&#8242; phase not only contributes to improved electron transport but also effectively inhibits the V-dissolution of &lt;i&gt;a-&lt;/i&gt;ZVO. Therefore, the prepared &lt;i&gt;a-&lt;/i&gt;ZVO@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and conceptually validated &lt;i&gt;a-&lt;/i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; derived from commercial &lt;i&gt;c-&lt;/i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit excellent cycling stability at an ultralow current density (0.05&#8197;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) while maintaining good rate capability and capacity retention. This research achievement provides a new effective strategy for various amorphous cathode designs for AZIBs with superior performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;Ones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Thioamides: Stereodivergent Synthesis of Rocaglaol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct catalytic asymmetric conjugate reaction between benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, promoted by a soft Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base cooperative catalysis was developed to access all four stereoisomers of a key intermediate for rocaglaol and its derivatives. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and ligand&#8208;controlled diastereodivergence.







Abstract
Rocaglaol, a representative flavagline, has attracted significant attention because of its unique chemical structure and biological activities. This paper reports a mild and scalable copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. This method allows for the concise synthesis of all possible stereoisomers of a key intermediate of rocaglaol and its derivatives in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective manner using different chiral phosphine ligands. Theoretical insights into the reaction mechanism and the origin of ligand&#8208;dependent diastereodivergence were obtained using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Catalytically Active Site Mapping Realized through Energy Transfer Modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like a telescope mapping the stars in the sky, resonance energy transfer (RET) offers a window into the world of catalytic &#8220;stars&#8221; nestled within a porous matrix &#8220;sky&#8221;. Integrating catalysts as guests within any porous matrix of a host&#8211;guest catalytic system allows for visualizing active site positions. By mimicking catalysts, fluorescent models pinpoint active sites, while host&#8211;guest systems ensure a &#8242;core&#8211;shell&#8242; distribution, minimizing mass transport effects.







Abstract
The demands of a sustainable chemical industry are a driving force for the development of heterogeneous catalytic platforms exhibiting facile catalyst recovery, recycling, and resilience to diverse reaction conditions. Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst transitions can be realized through the integration of efficient homogeneous catalysts within porous matrices. Herein, we offer a versatile approach to understanding how guest distribution and evolution impact the catalytic performance of heterogeneous host&#8211;guest catalytic platforms by implementing the resonance energy transfer (RET) concept using fluorescent model systems mimicking the steric constraints of targeted catalysts. Using the RET&#8208;based methodology, we mapped condition&#8208;dependent guest (re)distribution within a porous support on the example of modular matrices such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Furthermore, we correlate RET results performed on the model systems with the catalytic performance of two MOF&#8208;encapsulated catalysts used to promote CO2 hydrogenation and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Guests are incorporated using aperture&#8208;opening encapsulation, and catalyst redistribution is not observed under practical reaction conditions, showcasing a pathway to advance catalyst recyclability in the case of host&#8211;guest platforms. These studies represent the first generalizable approach for mapping the guest distribution in heterogeneous host&#8211;guest catalytic systems, providing a foundation for predicting and tailoring the performance of catalysts integrated into various porous supports.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Dehydrogenative Aromatization of n&#8208;Hexyl to Phenyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8208;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).</dc:description>

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160 min&#8208;1 to 0.00133 min&#8208;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis suggests that the split force transmission within the ring may suppress the sequential bond rupture mechanism in AM mechanophores under applied forces.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer-based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene-maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160 min-1 to 0.00133 min-1, achieving up to a 12-fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis suggests that the split force transmission within the ring may suppress the sequential bond rupture mechanism in AM mechanophores under applied forces. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving a Thermodynamic Self&#8208;Regulation Dynamic Adsorption Mechanism for Ammonia Synthesis through Selective Orbital Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the continuous pursuing on the improvement of catalytic activity, a catalyst performed exceeding catalytic volcano plots is desired, while it is impeded by the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relations of reaction intermediates. Numerous efforts have been focused on optimizing the initial and final intermediates to circumvent the scaling relations for an improved performance. For a step forward, simultaneously optimizing all intermediates is essential to explore the theoretical maximum of catalytic activity. Herein, we proposed a dynamic adsorption mechanism (DAM) to independently regulate the adsorption configurations of all intermediates of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To demonstrate the DAM, a multi&#8208;site NbNi3 intermetallic is developed, which enables suitable adsorption energies of different intermediates via modulating orbital coupling mechanisms. As a result, NbNi3 achieves an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of NRR of &#8722;0.11 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Strikingly, the theoretical result is confirmed by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, wherein the nanoporous NbNi3 electrode exhibits a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 25.89 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the Faradic efficiency of 33.15% at &#8722;0.25 V vs. RHE. Overall, this work brings out a new strategy to avoid the scaling relations, and opens up a promising avenue toward high&#8208;efficiency NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules through Top Interface Modification with N&#8208;type Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface modification between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in achieving high performance inverted perovskite photovoltaics (i&#8208;PPVs). Herein, non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), known as Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO, were utilized to modify the perovskite/ETL interface in i&#8208;PPVs. Non&#8208;polar solvent&#8208;soluble NFAs can effectively passivate surface defects without structural damage of the underlying perovskite films. Additionally, the improved PCBM ETL induced by NFAs modification significantly accelerates the electrons extraction. As a result, both Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO exhibit more effective interface modification effects compared to traditional PI molecules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted perovskite solar cell (i&#8208;PSC) modified with Y7&#8208;BO reaches 25.82%. Moreover, the adoption of non&#8208;polar solvents and the superior semiconductor properties of Y7&#8208;BO molecules also enable perovskite solar modules (i&#8208;PSM) with effective areas of 50 cm2, 400 cm2, and 1160 cm2 to achieve record efficiencies of 23.05%, 22.32%, and 21.1% (certified PCE), respectively, making them the best PCE reported in the literature. Importantly, enhanced interface mechanical strength between the perovskite and PCBM layer results in significantly improved environmental and operational stability of the cells. The cells modified with Y7&#8208;BO maintained 94.4% of the initial efficiency after 1522 hours of maximum power point aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycopolymer&#8208;Mediated Selective Separation of Middle Rare Earth Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs), particularly middle REEs (MREEs) with intermediate ionic radii, poses significant challenges for current methods. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages negatively charged glycopolymers for size&#8208;specific separation of MREEs. By varying glycopolymer properties such as degree of polymerization (DP) and charge density, we achieved a distinct U&#8208;shaped selectivity profile, with a pronounced preference for Samarium (Sm) and Europium (Eu) over other REEs like Cerium (Ce), Gadolinium (Gd), and Holmium (Ho). Enrichment experiments demonstrated the practical potential of this methodology, achieving over 10% selectivity for Sm in Ce/Sm and Ho/Sm mixtures (10:1 ratios). Further, a separation experiment with a 1:1 Ce/Sm mixture yielded 15% enrichment after five filtration cycles with minimal glycopolymer, underscoring the approach's effectiveness. This work highlights the promise of glycopolymer&#8208;based strategies for targeted MREE separation, offering an efficient and tunable pathway for refining separation processes in REE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Selective Zeolites for Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation&#8208;Carbonylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8208;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a biofuel&#8208;driven recyclable chiral supramolecular transfer container based on hexacationic triphenylamine cage and nucleotides. Possessing rotatable paddle rigid backbones, the artificial receptor effectively encapsulated nucleotides with a high binding constant up to 5.37&#215;105 M&#8208;1 in water, displaying guest&#8208;induced efficient fluorescence enhancement with quantum yield increased from 6.5% to 16.6%. Especially, the achiral cage could effectively bind with adenosine triphosphate to activate chirality transfer from substrates to the single molecular container, giving circularly polarized luminescence at 575 nm and positive Cotton effect peaks with significant asymmetric factor (gabs = +6.4&#215;10&#8208;4). Meanwhile, the adaptive chiral supramolecule not only has reversible thermal responsiveness but also could stepwise regulate chirality transfer by the catalysis of hexokinase and apyrase in tandem, showing recovery adaptive chirality after refueled, achieving dynamically regulated programmable multistate chiral luminescent supramolecules. Therefore, the biofuel&#8208;driven chiral supramolecular transfer container could be successfully applied in chiral logic gates and multilevel information encryption, providing new insight into intelligent chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Baddeley Reaction: Access to Functionalized Decalins by Charge&#8208;Promoted Alkane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization of purely aliphatic substrates is a challenging endeavor, as the absence of directing groups generally thwarts attempts at regiocontrol. This is particularly true for difunctionalization reactions, where the control of relative stereochemistry poses an additional obstacle. The Baddeley reaction of decalins, despite suffering from strong limitations with regard to yield and generality, stands as one of only few known transformations capable of regio&#8208; and stereocontrol in aliphatic C&#8211;H functionalization. Herein, we report a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective method for the double functionalization of decalins enabling access to a novel, unreported regioisomer in synthetically useful yields. This method was also successfully applied to a range of other alkane substrates, enabling a straightforward synthesis of keto alcohols from the simplest alkane building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EV)s hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we reveal a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n = 63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by an Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km = 59.31 mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebuilding Peripheral F, Cl, Br Footprints on Acceptors Enables Binary Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency Exceeding 19.7%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given homomorphic fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and location on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH&#8208;F, CH&#8208;C and CH&#8208;B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re&#8208;permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH&#8208;B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH&#8208;B blend. Further benefitting from the large dielectric constant, small exciton binding energy, optimized molecular packing and great electron transfer integral, CH&#8208;B affords the first class binary OSC efficiency of 19.78%, moreover, the highest efficiency of 18.35% thus far when increasing active layer thickness to ~300 nm. Our successful screening in rebuilding peripheral halogen footprints provides the valuable insight into further rational design of SMAs for record&#8208;breaking OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Ambient and High&#8208;Temperature Beryllium Nitride Motifs in W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds of transition metals and beryllium have a wide range of applications, from everyday tools to high tech applications. Remarkably, no single ternary beryllium nitride with a transition metal is known. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates, namely W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9. Both compounds were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from Be3N2 and W, using azide generated N2 as an oxidizing agent. The crystal structures, consisting of alternating layers of WN6 trigonal prisms and BeN4 tetrahedra, were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). The separating nitridoberyllate layers show either ambient temperature (&#945;&#8208;Be3N2 type) or high temperature (&#946;&#8208;Be3N2 type) motifs. W2Be4N5 was further corroborated by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV&#8208;VIS spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements. The latter revealed a mixed valence with an intermediate oxidation state of 3.5 for the W atoms. Both, the synthesis of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates and the synthesis approach using elemental W pave the way to a new field of nitride chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Configuration Assignment of (+)&#8208;Myxoquaterine&#8208;450</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Myxoquaterines represent a recently discovered class of natural products with intriguing biological properties. They were isolated from Pendulasporacea albinea MSr 11954 and display a unique structure combining heterocyclic (pyrrole, oxazoline), hexa&#173;ene, and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol subunits. We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine&#8208;450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l&#8208;serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.</dc:description>

We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine-450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l-serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential. Especially the separation of cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons from their aromatic counterparts remains a significant challenge due to azeotrope formation and similar physical properties, often requiring energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we introduce a novel class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure to optimise &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions within the pore, enabling the highly selective molecular sieving of aromatic compounds from mixtures. Utilising dynamic covalent imine chemistry, the squareimine NDI2F42&#8208;based crystalline functional material is directly obtained from the reaction mixture in a single self&#8208;assembly step in high yields of 84%, alongside the larger NDI2F82 congener, which can be obtained in 69% yield. In vapour sorption and diffusion experiments, NDI2F42 demonstrates rapid adsorption kinetics with selectivities of 97:3 for benzene over cyclohexane and 93:7 for toluene over methylcyclohexane, while single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirm that the selectivity is primarily governed by directed &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Graphene/MoS2 Heterointerfaces by Perpendicular Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface chemistry and interface interactions profoundly influence the properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. Therefore, developing methods to precisely control surfaces and interfaces is crucial for harnessing the properties and functions of 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, we developed a facile approach to tuning the interface distance and properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (G/MoS2) by varying the functional groups attached to the surface of graphene bottom layer. We systematically investigated how different functionalized graphene bottom layers affect the interlayer distance, coupling between the interlayers, and optical properties of resulting G/MoS2 heterostructures. Our findings indicate that both the size and electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating properties of functional groups are pivotal in regulating charge transport properties, with size playing a particularly decisive role. Our approach demonstrates an efficient and flexible pathway to regulate the interlayer spacing and charge transport, highlighting the potential of engineering interface chemistry in optimizing properties of van der Waals heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2 days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. This work introduces a new design strategy for stable high&#8208;spin hydrocarbons, paving the way for future developments in high&#8208;spin organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion/Downshifting Circularly Polarized Luminescence over 1200&#8197;nm in a Single Nanoparticle for Optical Anticounterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, has been realized within a single nanoparticle. This approach enables cutting&#8208;edge encryption applications, including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption.







Abstract
Multimodal upconversion and downshifting circularly polarized luminescent materials hold significant potential for optical anticounterfeiting applications due to their exceptional chiroptical properties. However, constructing these materials within a single emitter remains challenging. In this study, a conceptual model of multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized within a single nanoparticle. A new type of nanoparticles with multilayer core&#8211;shell architecture is fabricated, capable of delivering upconversion/downshifting luminescence, when excited by a 980&#8197;nm laser. Utilizing a co&#8208;assembly strategy, multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL emission, covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, can be realized at the supramolecular level. These chiroptical properties closely follow the chirality of host matrix and are strongly dependent on the distribution mode of nanoparticles within the matrix films. The multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL behavior enabled cutting&#8208;edge encryption applications including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption. This work introduces a novel approach to designing multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL materials and opens new avenues for the development of chiroptical functional materials.

         <title>Fabrication of Hierarchical Nanostructures Featuring Amplified Asymmetry Through Co&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer and Chiral Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical colloidal architectures, characterized by distinct asymmetry, were fabricated through the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with amphiphiles containing chiral amino acid linkers. This study elucidates the regulatory pathways for hierarchical assembly via synergistic effects, highlighting how subtle changes in linker structure can effectively fine&#8208;tune transitions in helical and hierarchical morphology.







Abstract
The widespread presence of hierarchical asymmetric structures in nature has sparked considerable interest because of their unique functionalities. These ingenious structures across multiple scales often emerge from the transfer and amplification of asymmetry from chiral molecules under various synergistic effects. However, constructing artificial chiral asymmetric structures, particularly in developing hierarchical multicomponent structures analogous to those formed in nature through synergistic non&#8208;covalent interactions, still presents tremendous challenges. Herein, we propose a co&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate hierarchical chiral mesostructures by combining a liquid crystalline block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with a small molecular amphiphile containing chiral alanine or phenylalanine as a linker. Through a classic solvent&#8208;exchange process, chiral amphiphiles embedded within LC&#8208;BCP finely regulate the LC ordering effect and facilitate transfer and amplification of asymmetry. Consequently, various co&#8208;assembled structures with significant hierarchical chirality features are obtained through synergetic effects. Remarkably, subtle alterations to the side groups of amino acids in the amphiphiles effectively adjust the hierarchical morphology transition. Moreover, the covalent bonding sequence of amino acids in the amphiphiles emerges as a critical factor governing the formation of hierarchical nanofibers and multilayered vesicles exhibiting a superhelical sense.

         <title>Stabilization of High&#8208;Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the dynamic equilibriums of Co2+/3+ states is proposed as a novel strategy to enhance oxygen evolution. P heteroatoms of reduced graphene oxide are applied to link Co2+ acetylacetonate. By increasing the oxidation degrees of P heteroatoms, the Co sites are spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling. The as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibits intrinsically high oxygen evolution activity.







Abstract
Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH&#8722;/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling at an open circuit condition.

     alt="Stabilization of High-Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stabilization of high-valent Co sites to shift away from the dynamic equilibriums of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+/3+&lt;/sup&gt; states is proposed as a novel strategy to enhance oxygen evolution. P heteroatoms of reduced graphene oxide are applied to link Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; acetylacetonate. By increasing the oxidation degrees of P heteroatoms, the Co sites are spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions coupling. The as-derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibits intrinsically high oxygen evolution activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; states coupling with OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high-valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, the as-derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectric Dipoles Tailoring Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Chemistry to Enable Reversible Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) is assembled with reduced graphene oxide, the strong electronegativity on anode surface would stimulate nearby BTO particles, triggering specific polarization switching of their surface dipoles, resulting in a directional and enhanced polarization electric field, during the Li plating. Attributed to electrostatic interactions, the favorable polarization electric field generated on BTO surface could continuously introduce anions into the Helmholtz layer, allowing more targeted anions (TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722;) to degrade and participate in the subsequent construction of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). As expected, the superior SEIs derived from anions are formed.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a decisive role in building reliable Li metal batteries. However, the scarcity of anions in Helmholtz layer (HL) caused by electrostatic repulsion usually leads to the inferior SEI derived from solvents, resulting in dendrites and &#8216;dead&#8217; Li. Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions&#8208;derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO&#8208;BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; into anion&#8208;defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO&#8208;BTO (10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700&#8197;h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P&#8776;6.3) using rGO&#8208;BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0&#8201;% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.

         <title>Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 Over 800&#8197;Hours</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient anion exchange membrane (AEM) and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer enable an AEM water electrolysizer (AEMWE) to operate at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.3&#8197;V. The optimized AEMWE demonstrates an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over a benchmark.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology for green hydrogen production. Although the normal current densities of AEMWEs are below 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operating them at higher current densities represents an efficient, but little&#8208;explored approach to decrease the total cost of hydrogen production. We show here that a benchmark AEMWE has an operational lifetime of only seconds at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By using a more conductive and robust AEM, and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer, we have developed AEMWEs that stably operate at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with extended lifetimes. The optimized AEMWE has an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over the current benchmark. The cell voltage is only 2.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, comparable to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices operating at current densities lower than 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Arylation using Alternating Polarity in flow for Compound Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of compound libraries in flow enabled the C&#8722;X arylation of&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds in the presence of diverse amines (including sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid electrode passivation.







Abstract
Etherification and amination of aryl halide scaffolds are commonly used reactions in parallel medicinal chemistry to rapidly scan structure&#8211;activity relationships with abundant building blocks. Electrochemical methods for aryl etherification and amination demonstrate broad functional group tolerance and extended nucleophile scope compared to traditional methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for robust and scale&#8208;transferable workflows for electrochemical compound library synthesis. Herein we describe a platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of C&#8722;X arylation (X=NH, OH) in flow to access compound libraries. A comprehensive Design of Experiment (DoE) study identifies an optimal protocol which generates high yields across&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds, diverse amines (including electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). Reaction sequences are automated on commercially available equipment to generate libraries of anilines and aryl ethers. The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid accumulating electrode passivation. Moreover, it enables reactions to be performed in air, without supporting electrolyte and with high reproducibility over consecutive runs. Our method represents a powerful means to rapidly generate nucleophile independent C&#8722;X arylation compound libraries using flow electrochemistry.

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8722;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and weak adsorption and activation of CH3OH and CO were realized on charge&#8208;density&#8208;distinct Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2, boosting the direct gas phase heterogeneous carbonylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100&#8197;h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8722;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8722;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.

Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl-containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space-time-yield (STY) of 4.74 mol&lt;sub&gt;acetyl&lt;/sub&gt;/kg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;/h and a durable stability as long as 100&#8197;h on Ni@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH to break its C&#8722;O bond and non-dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8722;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Mechanochemical Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cocrystal Precursor Strategy for Confined Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cocrystal precursor template strategy employs confined assembly for the synthesis of 2D&#8208;imine&#8208;COFs using N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons in a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process. This strategy leverages the directionality of the helical hydrogen bonding network and the protonation transfer of amine monomers to facilitate the ordered stacking and confined assembly necessary for imine COF formation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional imine covalent organic frameworks (2D imine&#8208;COFs) are crystalline porous materials with broad application prospects. Despite the efforts into their design and synthesis, the mechanisms of their formation are still not fully understood. Herein, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step mechanochemical cocrystal precursor synthetic strategy is developed for efficient construction of 2D imine&#8208;COFs. The mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the cocrystal precursors of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT) and p&#8208;toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) sufficiently regulate the crystalline structure of COF. Evidenced by characterizations and theoretical studies, a helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network was constructed by the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons between amino and sulfonic groups in TAPT&#8208;PTSA, demonstrating the role of cocrystals in promoting the organized stacking of interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, layer arrangement, and interlayer spacing, thus facilitating the orderly assembly of COFs. Moreover, the protonation degree of TAPT amines, which tuned nucleophilic directionality, enabled the sequential progression of intra&#8208; and interlayer imine condensation reactions, inhibiting the formation of amorphous polymers. The transformation from cocrystal precursors to COFs was achieved through comprehensive control of hydrogen bond and covalent bond sites. This work significantly advances the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated COF assembly and its mechanochemical method in the design and synthesis of 2D imine&#8208;COFs, further elucidating the mechanistic aspects of their mechanochemical synthesis.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;stage Benzylic Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly site&#8208;selective acridinium/HAT catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions with simple and inexpensive D2O as an isotope source is reported. Unprecedented selective HIE on competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions was achieved with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation, enabling the effective late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives.







Abstract
A highly regioselective visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of benzylic positions in both simple and complex molecules is reported. The process follows a dual catalytic approach using an acridinium photocatalyst in combination with a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, while the use of D2O as an isotope source ensures operational simplicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. High reactivity has been achieved for electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions. Moreover, targeted radical formation enables unprecedented selective HIE on intramolecular competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation. The utility of the reaction was demonstrated on the late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism followed by deprotonation to generate the benzylic radical, and revealed the importance of halogenated solvents or additives. Upon a weak complexation of the halogenated species to the substrate, an oxidation potential lowering effect is induced, as well as a stabilization of the radical&#8208;cation species through spin delocalization.

         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) is crucial for accurate tumor diagnosis, offering superior resolution and penetration capabilities. Current NIR&#8208;II probes are limited by either being "always on" or responding to one stimulus, leading to low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and potential false positives. We introduced a dual&#8208;lock&#8208;controlled probe, HN&#8208;PBA, activated by both H2O2 and tumor acidic environment. This dual response ensures bright fluorescence at tumor sites, leading to higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue ratios (T/NT) compared to conventional &#8220;always on&#8221; probes and probes activated only by H2O2. This strategy allows precise tumor identification and removal of primary and metastatic tumors, achieving superior T/NT ratios (24.3/6.4 for orthotopic and lung metastasis, respectively). Our probe also effectively detected lung metastatic foci as small as &#8804; 0.7 mm and showed the capability for accurate lesion localization in clinical breast cancer specimens. This dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy could aid future diagnostic probe design.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting WLED&#8208;Excited High Temperature Long Afterglow by Orthogonally Anchoring Chromophores into 0D Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal anchoring of chromophores into 0D metal&#8208;organic cages to achieve high&#8208;temperature long afterglow emission. The afterglow emission of Cd&#8208;IDB&#8208;IPA reached 600&#8197;s after turning off the 365&#8197;nm UV lamp at 77&#8197;K, and the afterglow emission was still observed after being excited by WLED at 380&#8197;K.







Abstract
Afterglow materials have garnered significant interest due to distinct photophysical characteristics. However, it is still difficult to achieve long afterglow phosphorescence from organic molecules due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and energy dissipation. In addition, most materials reported so far have long afterglow emission only at room or even low temperatures, and mainly use UV light as an excitation source. In this work, we report a strategy to achieve high temperature long afterglow emission through the assembly of isolated 0D metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). In which, both ACQ and phosphorescence quenching effects are effectively mitigated by altering the stacking mode of organic chromophores through orthogonally anchoring into the edges of cubic MOCs. Furthermore, improvement in molecular rigidity, promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling and broadening of the absorption range are achieved through the MOC&#8208;engineering strategy. As a result, we successfully synthesized MOCs that can produce afterglow emission even after excitation by WLEDs at high temperatures (380&#8197;K). Moreover, the MOCs are capable of generating afterglow emissions when excited by mobile phone flashlight at room temperature. Given these features, the potential applications of MOCs in the visual identification of explosives, information encryption and multicolor display are explored.

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Modified Buried Interface of High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interface layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs, passivates the surface defects from both the surfaces, and enhances the interfacial adhesion and mechanical reliability. The resulting PSCs exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl-4,4&#8242;-dicarboxylic acid (&lt;b&gt;HBPDC&lt;/b&gt;) is incorporated as an interface layer between SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and perovskite layers in PSCs, passivates the surface defects from both the surfaces, and enhances the interfacial adhesion and mechanical reliability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl-4,4&#8242;-dicarboxylic acid (&lt;b&gt;HBPDC&lt;/b&gt;) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and perovskite layers in PSCs. The two carboxylic acid moieties on &lt;b&gt;HBPDC&lt;/b&gt; bind to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through esterification, while its nitrogen atoms, possessing lone electron pairs, interact with uncoordinated lead (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) atoms through Lewis acid-base interactions. This dual functionality enables simultaneous passivation of surface defects on both the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and buried perovskite layers. In addition, the electron-deficient nature of &lt;b&gt;HBPDC&lt;/b&gt; enhances interfacial energy band alignment and facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the incorporation of &lt;b&gt;HBPDC&lt;/b&gt; strengthens the interfacial adhesion, improving mechanical reliability. As a result, the PSCs exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41&#8201;% under standard AM 1.5G conditions, along with remarkable environmental stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A De Novo Auto&#8208;Activated Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrid System for Hydrogen Production in Methanotrophic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Climate change driving by greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum&#8208;based energy has garnered significant attention. Renewable energy production via a sustainable system that integrates the cell factory and visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysts offers a novel approach for upcycling methane and addressing global energy challenges. Here, an auto&#8208;activated biohybrid system driven by solar energy is developed for converting methane into hydrogen fuel, which incorporated thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+) and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria. In this system, S&#8208;MV2+ functioned as photosensitizer and electron mediator, capturing solar energy and supplying electrons for an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed bioprocess. The genetically modified Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 mutant, lacking methanol dehydrogenase but overexpressing hydrogenase, is able to convert methane into methanol that maintains the electron flow cycle by quenching photogenerated holes for both hydrogen biosynthesis and methane oxidation. Finally, the highest H2 production of 272.96 &#181;M from this biohybrid system was achieved with methanol as a sacrificial agent generated by the H2&#8208;producing mutant, resulting in a 140&#8208;fold enhancement. This innovative method showcases the potential of coupling photocatalysis with methanotrophic biocatalysis for sustainable energy production. Additionally, the system introduces a new strategy for self&#8208;regeneration of sacrificial agents, offering a promising avenue for hydrogen production using greenhouse gases in an eco&#8208;friendly manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Confined Synthesis of BiVO4 Nanocluster for Urea Production with Remarkable O2/N2 Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8208; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8208; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8208; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8208; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2&#8208;framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#160;Spin&#8208;State Modulation of Catalytic Centers by Weak Ligand Field for Promoting Sulfur Redox Reaction in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spin state of transition&#8208;metal compounds in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) significantly impacts the electronic properties and the kinetics of sulfur redox reactions (SRR). However, accurately designing the spin state remains challenging, which is crucial for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship and developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, the CoF2, specifically the Co2+ with 3d7 electrons in a high&#8208;spin state distribution (t2g5eg2), were tailored predictably for the first time through the weak coordination field effect of the F element. Both DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the spin state of Co2+ transitions from low&#8208; to high&#8208;spin configurations and strongly interacts with sulfur species through Co&#8208;S and Li&#8208;F bonds during the SRR process. This interaction weakens the S&#8208;S bond, promoting its facile cleavage from both ends while also facilitating the rapid and uniform nucleation of Li2S2/Li2S, thus resulting in LSBs with a capacity of 447.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 C rates and stable cycling for 1000 cycles, with an acceptable practical capacity of 585 mAh g&#8208;1 at a high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm&#8208;2. This work achieves rational control of the active Co2+ d electron state through the field effect and enriches the application of spin control to accelerate SRR in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Interhalogen&#8208;involved aqueous Zn||halogen batteries (AZHBs) are latent high&#8208;energy systems for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet usually suffer from poor high&#8208;rate endurability caused by the formation of &#8220;dead species&#8221;. Herein, via an electrochemically&#8208;densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL), Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries involving interhalogen reactions between the I2 cathode and Br&#8208; from the electrolytes are initially achieved with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability. Different from that in diluted electrolytes, the CIRL formed in Br&#8208;&#8208;concentrated electrolyte is denser and water&#8208;lean, which enables halogen species conversion with a more rapid charge transfer and lower activation energy. More importantly, the CIRL robustly affords a decent I2 conservation by accelerated conversion kinetics and limited species diffusion, thereby endowing the Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries with an ultralong high&#8208;rate lifespan. The electrochemical mechanism is sufficiently verified by multiple spectral characterizations. Consequently, Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries in Br&#8208;&#8208;concentrated (20 m) electrolytes exhibit an overwhelming rate capability and lifespan to those in Br&#8208;&#8208;diluted (2 m) electrolytes. Typically, when cycled at a large current density of 10 A g&#8208;1, an ultralong lifespan of over 25,000 cycles is achieved with a high retention of 98.3%. This study provides new insight into the CIRL&#8208;dictated active species conservation for high&#8208;rate endurable AZHBs, which could apply to other high&#8208;energy interhalogen batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, LiNO3 significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, and its protective effect on lithium metal is limited, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Reactivity of Nitrones with Amino Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled modifications of amino acids are an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental and translational research based on peptides and proteins. Yet, we still lack methods to chemically modify each naturally occurring amino acid sidechain. To help address this gap, we show that N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines expand the scope of bioconjugation methods to chemically modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues with evidence for additional tyrosine labelling in a proteomic context. Conjugation primarily at tryptophan sites can be accessed by selective cleavage of modifications at other sidechains. The N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridine reagents are accessed through photoisomerization of nitrones, which serve as photocaged reagents, thus providing an additional level of control over reactivity. Initial guiding principles for the design of nitrone reagents are developed by exploring the impact of structure on UV&#8208;vis absorption, photoisomerization, and reactivity. We identify a nitrone structure that maximizes photoisomerization efficiency, the aqueous stability of the oxaziridine, the extent of amino acid modification, and the stability of the resulting amino acid conjugates. We then translate nitrone reagents to modify proteins in aqueous conditions. Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage</dc:description>

         <title>Location&#8208;Specific Microenvironment Modulation Around Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite coordination environment of catalytic metal sites has been recognized to be of great importance in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), a significant challenge remains in the understanding how the location&#8208;specific microenvironment in the higher coordination sphere influences their catalysis. Herein, a series of Cu&#8208;based SACs, namely Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2), are successfully constructed by anchoring single Cu atoms onto the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X. The &#8208;X functional groups dangling on the MOF linkers could be regarded as location&#8208;specific remote microenvironment to regulate electronic properties of the single Cu atoms. Remarkably, they exhibit significant differences in the catalysis toward the hydroboration of alkynes. The activity follows the order of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 &#707; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66 &#707; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under identical reaction conditions, where Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 showcases the phenylacetylene conversion of 92%, ~3.5 times higher efficiency than that of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Experimental and calculation results jointly support that the Cu electronic structure is modulated by the location&#8208;specific microenvironment, thereby regulating the product desorption and promoting the catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement effects and manipulation strategies of nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials featuring well&#8208;defined nanoscale channels have demonstrated inherent advantages in the selective transport of gases, liquids, and ions, making them pivotal in applications such as molecular separation, catalysis and energy storage. A crucial challenge lies in the assembly of ordered nanochannel structures and the transformation of such microscopic ordered structures into macroscopic regular distributions to achieve performance improvements. Nanocomposites provide a promising solution by incorporating nanoscale material (e.g., filler) that significantly enhance macroscale properties of matrix (e.g., polymer). In this review, we spotlight nanocomposite membranes that leverage the confinement effects between filler and matrix to construct precise nanochannels and regulate the nanochannel distribution. We discussed the underlying design principles, channel architectures, and the manipulation strategies for integrating filler and polymers into functional membranes. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental mechanisms of mass transport, and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships within the nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation. This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these nanocomposite membranes can be further developed to meet the demands of industrial and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Coplanarity and Giant Birefringence in Hydroxypyridinium Nitrate via Hydrogen Bonding between Planar Donors and Planar Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals, which possess optical anisotropy, are important optical components. However, designing and synthesizing birefringent crystals faces the challenge of achieving anisotropic structures, especially coplanar geometries. Herein, we achieve a significant birefringence in an ionic compound (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8211;, (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium nitrate, 4HPN) by hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors. We demonstrate that the interactions between the planar hydrogen bond donor ((C5H6ON)+) and planar hydrogen bond acceptor ((NO3)&#8211;) ensure the coplanarity during the crystal packing, generating the desired giant optical anisotropy. On two manually cut crystal chips, we observe a &#160;= 0.494 (&#160;= 0.593), which is the largest among nitrates, or hydroxypyridinium derivatives. This &#160;value already surpasses those of the benchmark crystals, e.g., YVO4 and CaCO3, commonly used in the UV to visible and near IR spectral range. 4HPN also exhibits a strong second harmonic generation response (9.55 &#215; KDP). This strategy offers a promising avenue for the design and development of birefringent crystals with potential applications in optical communication, sensing and signal processing devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Origin of the Methoxy Group in Quinine and Related&#160;Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>a methoxy group that has been assumed to be incorporated at a late pathway stage. Here we show that the methoxy group in quinine and related alkaloids is introduced onto the starting substrate tryptamine. Feeding studies definitively show that 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine is utilized as a quinine biosynthetic intermediate in planta. We discover the biosynthetic genes that encode the responsible oxidase and methyltransferase, and we use these genes to reconstitute the early steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce a mixture of methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloid intermediates. Importantly, we show that the co&#8208;occurrence of both tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine substrates, along with the substrate promiscuity of downstream pathway enzymes, enable parallel formation of both methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy towards Michael Addition Reactions of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of Michael addition reactions to conjugated cyclopropenes is a challenge in organic synthesis due to the fleeting and reactive nature of such strained Michael acceptor systems. Herein, the development of a photochemical approach towards such conjugated cyclopropenes is reported that serves as a strategic entry point to densely functionalized cyclopropanes in a diastereoselective fashion. The process involves the light&#8208;mediated generation of transient cyclopropenyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters from vinyl diazo esters, followed by an organic base catalyzed nucleophilic addition of N&#8208;heterocycles to directly access &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic cyclopropanoic esters. With this synergistic approach, various trisubstituted cyclopropanes bearing N&#8208;heteroaryl and N&#8208;heterocyclic rings such as indole, pyrrole, benzimidazole, isatin, pyridinone and quinolinone were accessed efficiently in good yield and decent to good diastereoselectivities. Further, &#946;&#8208;indolyl cyclopropanoic acids have been synthesized and were successfully evaluated as FABP&#8208;4 inhibitors. Theoretical calculations have been performed to elucidate the mechanism which was further supported by experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, E/Z and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti&#8208;selectivity in vinyl&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn Node in Metal&#8208;Organic Layers on Carbon Nitride Support for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect&#8208;induced lattice distortion presents an advantageous approach to tailor the electronic structure and CO2 adsorption properties of catalytic centers, consequently conferring desirable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, achieving precise J&#8208;T distortion control over catalytic sites to enhance CO2 adsorption/activation and target&#8208;product desorption remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we successfully induced J&#8208;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8208;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8208;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8208;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn2+ increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO2, as evidenced by the enhanced d&#8208;p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice&#8208;mismatched Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power&#8208;efficient, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR&#8208;TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter&#8208;system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR&#8208;TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15 nm, but also exhibit close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation. The resulting sensitizer&#8208;free OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% at maximum and 31.8% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2. Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT80) of 485 hours at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8208;2. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1 wt%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5 wt% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowing the exact location of the semiconductor band&#8208;edges is key for mechanistic insights into their use for water and CO2 photo/electrocatalysis. In this regard, a reliable strategy for nano&#8208;semiconductors did not exist yet. We demonstrate the use of reversible redox probes on nano&#8208;semiconductor electrodes to determine their band&#8208;edge locations in aqueous solutions. Rectifying current&#8208;potential (i&#8208;U) characteristics with the high work function Fe(CN)63&#8208;/Fe(CN)64&#8208; redox couple yielded the exact flatband potential at various pH whereas the reversible i&#8208;U characteristics with the low work function Ru(NH3)63+/Ru(NH3)62+ redox couple provided the conduction band&#8208;edge location and dopant concentration for a 30nm thin&#8208;film n&#8208;TiO2. The methodology can be extended to other nano&#8208;semiconductors and serves as an alternative to and goes beyond the capabilities of the Mott&#8208;Schottky procedure for bulk semiconductor electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interface Dipole Interaction between Ethers and Active Species toward Highly Stable Li&#8208;SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is recognized as a promising organic cathode for long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries. Nevertheless, the irreversible cleavage/formation of multiple sulfur&#8208;sulfur (S&#8208;S) bonds of SPAN within conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes results in loss of active S species, severe capacity fading and shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. Benefiting from the particular chain&#8208;coordination structure and weak dipole interactions with Li+ and active species, the resulting electrolyte not only achieves low desolvation energy barrier and high Li+ transference number, but also displays stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface (EEI). Consequently, the full cells utilizing this electrolyte exhibit good cyclability, outstanding capacity retention and superior extreme&#8208;temperature (&#8208;50&#176;C to 50 &#176;C) performance. Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with lean electrolyte (2.5 g Ah&#8208;1) achieves record cycle stability with 96.5% capacity retention after 75 cycles, which deliver an initial specific energy density of 150 Wh kg&#8208;1 (based on the weight of the entire cell). Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of organic electrodes employing with PE&#8208;based electrolytes. This work highlights the strategy for modulating the dipole interaction at EEI for long&#8208;lifespan Li&#8208;organic batteries at extreme conditions.</dc:description>

Nevertheless, the irreversible cleavage/formation of multiple sulfur-sulfur (S-S) bonds of SPAN within conventional ether-based electrolytes results in loss of active S species, severe capacity fading and shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li-SPAN batteries. Benefiting from the particular chain-coordination structure and weak dipole interactions with Li+ and active species, the resulting electrolyte not only achieves low desolvation energy barrier and high Li+ transference number, but also displays stable electrolyte-electrode interface (EEI).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, poor stability and an unfavorable freezing point hinder their actual application. Herein, a ternary salts&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn0.2Na0.4Li0.4(ClO4)1.2&#183;7H2O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion&#8208;rich Zn2+ solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, characterization and calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the electrolyte entropy. As a consequence, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000 hours and 1500 hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na0.33V2O5/Zn and polyaniline/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000 cycles without capacity decay at &#8722;20 &#176;C, respectively. The pouch cells employing HEE deliver promising capacity and stability, even at high mass loading of active materials. This strategy of introducing multiple salts with different cations to construct a high&#8208;entropy environment provides a facile approach for high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs across a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Elastic Single&#8208;Atom Protrusions Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) generation, but the eNRR efficiency is dramatically impeded by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, inspired by the dynamic extension&#8208;contraction of sea anemone tentacles in response to environmental changes, we propose a biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion on vanadium oxide support (pSA Mo/VOH) electrocatalyst featuring a symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo site and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramid for efficient eNRR. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the protruding Mo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking structure optimizes the d electron filling of Mo, enhancing the back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* antibonding orbital, effectively polarizing the N&#8801;N bond and reducing the barrier from *N2 to *N2H. Notably, the elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure of pSA Mo provides a dynamic Mo&#8722;O microenvironment during continuous eNRR processes. This optimizes the electronic structure of the Mo sites based on different reaction intermediates, enhancing the adsorption of various N intermediates and maintaining low barriers throughout the six&#8208;step hydrogenation process. Consequently, the elastic pSA Mo/VOH exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 50.71 &#177; 1.12 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.38 &#177; 1.03%, outperforming most electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesis of Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Nanocluster Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing catalysts that simultaneously containing single atom/metal nanocluster active sites is a promising strategy to enhance the original catalytic behavior and accelerate the catalysis involving multi&#8208;electron reactions or multi&#8208;intermediates. Herein, the pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic method is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The controllable pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy allows the precise modulation of the active centers, realizing the optimization of the adsorption energy and the regulation of the synergistic active components. Specially, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2 of 25 mV and 8.6 mV, respectively, combining with outstanding durability towards high current density and methanol poisoning. This work developed a universal synthetic strategy for the single atom/nanocluster synergy systems and further demonstrated the superiority of heterogeneous components.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Single Atom&#8208;supported Covalent Organic Frameworks for Aqueous&#8208;phase Hydrogenative Hydrogenolysis of Aromatic Aldehydes via Hydrogen Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a method for the tandem hydrogenative hydrogenolysis of bio&#8208;based furfuryl aldehydes to methylfurans is crucial for synthesizing sustainable biofuels and chemicals; however, it poses a challenge due to the easy hydrogenation of the C=C bond and difficult cleavage of the C&#8211;O bond. Herein, a palladium (Pd) single&#8208;atom&#8208;supported covalent organic framework was fabricated and showed a unique 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran yield of up to 98.2% when reacted with 5&#8208;methyl furfuryl aldehyde in an unprecedented water solvent at 30&#176;C. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent catalytic universality while converting various furfuryl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, and heterocyclic aldehydes at room temperature. The analysis of the catalytic mechanism confirmed that H2 was heterolytically activated on the Pd&#8211;N pair and triggered the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) host, resulting in H&#8211;&#8211;Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O&#8211;H+ sites. These sites served as novel asymmetric hydrogenation sites for the C=O group and hydrogenolysis sites for the C&#8211;OH group through a scarce SN2 mechanism. This study demonstrated remarkable bifunctional catalysis through the H2&#8208;induced keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of COF catalysts for the atypical preparation of methyl aromatics in a water solvent at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Spring&#8208;Like Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes Experiencing Giant and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion Across Two Distinct Temperature Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic molecules with tunable chemical and physical properties in response to external stimuli hold great potential for applications in information storage, smart molecular machines, and biomimetics. Among them, supramolecular springs and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes can both undergo visible macroscopic changes under heat or light stimulation. In this study, we synthesized a trinuclear Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex, [(R&#8208;L)FeII{Au(CN)2}2] (R1), using a chiral chelating ligand decorated with rotatable benzyl rings. The [FeAu2] trinuclear molecules form a 21&#8208;helical supramolecular chain via elastic Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au contacts. Interestingly, the synergy between the multiple dynamic factors (SCO event, rotation of the rings, and flexibility in Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au distance) endows the complex with multiple switchings in both magnetism and structure, as well as the most intriguing characteristic of giant and anisotropic &#8220;breathing&#8221; feature in thermal expansion within two distinct temperature regimes. Specifically, complex R1 undergoes two hysteretic magnetic transitions: a non&#8208;spin transition and an unsymmetric SCO transition. Both transitions are triggered/accompanied by the rotation of the benzyl rings. Correspondingly, reversible spring&#8208;like motions of the helical chains are observed in the two distinct temperature regimes. This work demonstrates a significant success in incorporating both SCO and spring&#8208;like motion in one system, paving the way for designing multifunctional dynamic materials for future devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine: Attractive scaffold for highly selective inhibitors of underexplored protein kinases with variable binding mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases are key regulators of numerous biological processes and aberrant kinase activity can cause various diseases, particularly cancer. Herein, we report the identification of new series of highly selective kinase inhibitors based on the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold. The weak interaction of the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine core with the kinase hinge region allows for profoundly different binding modes all of which maintain high kinome&#8208;wide selectivity, as illustrated by the isomers MU1464 and MU1668. Thus, this core structure provides a template of ATP&#8208;competitive but not ATP&#8208;mimetic inhibitors that are anchored at the kinase back pocket. Mapping the chemical space around the central thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine pharmacophore afforded highly selective inhibitors of the kinase Haspin, exemplified by the compound MU1920 that fulfils criteria for a quality chemical probe and is suitable for use in in vivo applications. However, despite the role of Haspin in mitosis, the inhibition of Haspin alone was not sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. The thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used in a broader context, as a basis of inhibitors targeting other underexplored protein kinases, such as CDKLs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a robust strategy for tuning the electronic structure and chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs). By fusing two cyclopentadienyl rings in the peri&#8208;tetracene bay regions, we introduce antiaromatic character into the &#960;&#8208;system, leading to unique photophysical and electronic properties. A stable mesityl&#8208;substituted dicyclopenta&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was synthesized through stepwise formylation/intramolecular cyclization at the bay regions of the dihydro peri&#8208;tetracene precursor, followed by oxidative dehydrogenation. This compound features an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, global antiaromaticity, exceptional stability under ambient conditions, and amphoteric redox behavior with a small energy gap. Its dication also possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and its structure was identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, revealing a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure. In contrast, the dianion exhibits a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state. This work provides valuable insights for designing and synthesizing novel open&#8208;shell PHs with tunable electronic structures and remarkable stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Aggregation States of a Pd6L4 Cage for Selectivity Flipping during the Stereo&#8208;Divergent Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic system has been established using a singular palladium&#8208;based octahedral cage as the supramolecular reactor, deftly unlocking off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Water serves as a critical regulator, modulating the catalyst states, reaction rates, and endpoints. The choice of solvent system influences the activity of host&#8208;guest binding and the reaction types of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, effectively modifying the reaction steps involved in the Z&#8594;E isomerization during the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Kinetic and inhibition experiments indicate that the catalyst mimics the binding and activation characteristics of enzymes towards substrates, enabling selective transformations within the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment. The utility of this switchable cage&#8208;confined catalysis has been demonstrated in the synthesis and modification of complex biologically active molecules with controllable E/Z selectivity. This work sheds light on the design and control of artificial supramolecular counterparts of enzymes, offering fundamental insights into the factors influencing the activity and catalytic selectivity of biological macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Vertically Expanded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation into Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks with unique &#960; architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form &#960;&#8208;stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot polymerization. The frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24% at 450 nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39 h&#8722;1, which is even 5.1&#8208;fold as high as that of the &#960;&#8208;stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Chain Rearrangement of Natural Cellulose&#8208;based Artificial Interphase for Ultra&#8208;stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unstable electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, plagued by parasitic side reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth, severely hampers the practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a regenerated cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase with synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry on the Zn anode (RC@Zn), using a facile molecular chain rearrangement strategy. This RC interphase features a drastically increased amorphous region and more exposed active hydroxyl groups, facilitating rapid Zn2+ diffusion&#160;and homogeneous Zn2+ interface distribution, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Additionally, the compact texture and abundant negatively charged surface of the RC interphase effectively shield water molecules and harmful anions, completely preventing H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. The superior mechanical strength and adhesion of the RC interphase also accommodate the substantial volume changes of Zn anodes even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently,&#160;the RC@Zn electrode demonstrates an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000 hours at a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Significantly, the electrode maintains stable cycling even at a 90% depth of discharge and ensures stable operation of full cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.6. This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Fluorination Modulates Crystallinity and Aggregation of Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). In contrast to the general trend in terminal halogenation of electron acceptors, TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, featuring fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J&#8208;aggregate compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs with more organized active layer morphology and denser molecular packing, resulting in improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self&#8208;powered OPDs exhibit a 40&#8208;fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl&#8208;based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra&#8208;low Jd of 7.30&#180;10&#8208;12 A cm&#8208;2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320&#8208;920 nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#180;1014 Jones at 800 nm for the TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material&#8208;based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near-infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non-fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). In contrast to the general trend in terminal halogenation of electron acceptors, TBT-V-F, featuring fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J-aggregate compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT-V-Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT-V-F-based OPDs with more organized active layer morphology and denser molecular packing, resulting in improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self-powered OPDs exhibit a 40-fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT-V-Cl-based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra-low Jd of 7.30&#180;10-12 A cm-2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320-920 nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#180;1014 Jones at 800 nm for the TBT-V-F-based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material-based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Cumulene Character of One&#8208;Dimensional Acetylene&#8208;Based Systems by Stimuli&#8208;Induced Planarization of Their Two Pro&#8208;diradicaloid Cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene Units</title>

         <dc:description>Acetylene/polyynes &#8211;(C&#8801;C&#8211;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1&#8208;D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1&#8208;D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Coordination Chemistry of Graphitic Carbon Nitride from Ag Molecular Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has gained significant attention for its catalytic properties,&#160;especially&#160;in the development of Single Atom Catalysts (SACs).&#160;However,&#160;the surface chemistry underlying the formation of these isolated metal sites remains poorly understood.&#160;In this&#160;study&#160;we&#160;employ Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) together with advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques&#160;for an in&#8208;depth analysis of functionalized&#160;g&#8208;C3N4&#160;materials, where tailored organosilver probe molecules are used to monitor surface processes and characterize resulting surface species.

         <title>Urea/Thiourea Imine Linkages Provide Accessible Holes in Flexible Covalent Organic Frameworks and Dominates Self&#8208;Adaptivity and Exciton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the robust self&#8208;adaptivity and minimal energy&#8208;dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top&#8208;down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace&#8208;guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro&#8208;soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene&#8208;based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro&#8208;flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro&#8208;flexible thiourea&#8208;COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100% removal of micropollutant with low&#8208;energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes&#8208;mediated micropollutant decomposition.</dc:description>
