         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real&#8208;time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self-discharge characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;S&#8208;Selective Stille&#8208;Coupling Enables Stereodefined Alkene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Scalable and Sustainable Zinc (II) Ions&#8208;Glue&#8208;Assisted Conversion of Biomass Waste Bits into Carbon Aerogels for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemically-induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy using &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high&#8208;entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&#8722;1 during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering.

     alt="An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High-Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high-entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt-based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high-entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;mol&lt;sub&gt;C3H6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (23.5&#8197;mol&lt;sub&gt;C3H6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In a high-entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high-entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high-entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>

A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of molecular duplexes stabilized by up to 10 hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs between indolocarbazole and pyridine units have been investigated. In the presence of water, these duplexes transform into hydrated duplexes with water molecules inserted into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing manner. The two distinct forms can be reversibly switched through temperature changes, with characteristic signals observed spectroscopically.







Abstract
Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8800;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO2 as the cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn2+ ions and the MnO2 host, as well as increased interaction between H+ ions and MnO2. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn2+ insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.







Abstract
MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

         <title>Interface Engineering via Manipulating Solvation Chemistry for Liquid Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration.

&lt;p&gt;A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero-interphase, composed of gradient F, B-rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si-rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance and temperature-resistant lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &amp;gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero-interphase, composed of gradient F, B-rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si-rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high-temperature electrochemical performance.

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8722;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is rationally designed by the cation exchange method featuring self&#8208;limitation in the precise control over the composition and structure. The short atomic distance and the short&#8208;range cationic order of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enable the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O radicals, promoting an effective oxygen evolution reaction via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr-MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single-crystal X-ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh-MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal-based catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free&#8208;space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products. Our results cautions that the prediction of product structures based on the crystal structure can be misleading.







Abstract
A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6&#8197;&#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer. Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt's topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating, the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct. Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt&#8208;SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>

         <dc:description>
The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Borylative Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;Vinyl Cyclobutanols and Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Point Chirality Transfer in a Diastereoconvergent/Stereoretentive Allylation Scenery</title>

         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine&#8208;Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Near-full -spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full-spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP-PL emissions and high-pressure phase transitions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full-spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near-full-spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single-component two-dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (ETA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=(HO)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), is reported, achieved through high-pressure treatment. A pressure-induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red-shifted PL emissions, leading to the near-full-spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

A mixed crystalline m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 constructed by PHI network and internally embedded phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine framework (CHF&#8722;Ph) is synthesized via an in situ strategy. PHI and CHF&#8722;Ph form built&#8208;in type II heterojunction, and m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 has smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI. The hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic formic acid dehydrogenation reaches a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses most of the other organic photocatalysts.







Abstract
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have restricted the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8722;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8722;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8722;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Non&#8208;Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring&#8208;opening reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;di(piperidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of four-membered ring-embedded cycloarene &lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti-aromaticity and ultra-narrowband emission with a single-digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of fully fused &#960;-conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four-membered ring-embedded cycloarene (&lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt;) was designed and synthesized in single-crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond-linked chiral macrocycle &lt;b&gt;MS2&lt;/b&gt; without two fused four-membered rings and its linear-shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; were also synthesized.

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d-HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen-centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited-state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen-bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, and I) was developed by dissecting exciton dynamics, which could be specifically activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808&#8197;nm laser excitation, enabling fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging&#8208;escorted efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934; 1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808&#8197;nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in &#934; 1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808&#8197;nm laser power density (0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of ligand-controlled, copper-catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronates.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Migratory Hydroamidocarbonylation of Amide&#8208;Linked Alkenes to Access Chiral &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Succinimides</title>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of synthetic macrocycles, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), were designed and synthesized. By incorporating unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold, ExR4 exhibited a flexible backbone. Most importantly, ExR4 displayed remarkable potential in constructing adsorptive materials for iodine capture.







Abstract
The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted &#8220;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds.

Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

&lt;p&gt;A polymer-to-monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene-based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo-DCv-LCN) is reported. The Azo-DCv-LCN can be programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo-DCv-LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv-LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv-LCNs are still limited to heat-assisted programming and polymer-to-polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene-based DCv-LCN with room-temperature programmability and polymer-to-monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene-containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water-activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv-LCN can be simply programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv-LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid-solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv-LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shear&#8208;Strained Pd Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd single atoms suspended on interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed by dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were synthesized through low&#8208;temperature heat treatment. Pd&#8722;CuO introduces the dynamic effects of shear stress and carrier formation into Pd single atoms on dislocations, which can promote water activation and facilitate the hydrogenation of nitrate ions to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield of 4.2&#8197;mol.&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90&#8201;% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.

Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

An organic zwitterion comprising an acridinium cation and an amidate anion directly linked by an N&#8211;N bond was developed by Takeshi Yanai, Olga Garc&#237;a Manche&#241;o, Kohsuke Ohmatsu, Takashi Ooi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404890). With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries , additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <title>Artificial Polymerizations in Living Organisms for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review starts with a discussion on the diversity of artificial polymerizations, including those triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli, as well as those that occur spontaneously. The review also systematically summarizes the biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization including but not limited to safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Within living organisms, numerous nanomachines are constantly involved in complex polymerization processes, generating a diverse array of biomacromolecules for maintaining biological activities. Transporting artificial polymerizations from lab settings into biological contexts has expanded opportunities for understanding and managing biological events, creating novel cellular compartments, and introducing new functionalities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in artificial polymerizations, including those responding to external stimuli, internal environmental factors, and those that polymerize spontaneously. More importantly, the cutting&#8208;edge biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization, notably in safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and facilitating therapeutic efficacy are highlighted. Finally, this review outlines the key challenges and technological obstacles that remain for polymerizations in biological organisms, as well as offers insights into potential directions for advancing their practical applications and clinical trials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation operates under mild reaction conditions with low CO pressure (balloon) and exhibits excellent chemoselectivity for C(sp2)&#8722;I bond over other C(sp2)&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTf).







Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides utilizing ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. The present methodology is found to be general, efficient, employs mild reaction conditions and showcases a broad substrate scope even with structurally complex molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed mechanistic pathways distinct from those of conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi&#8208;quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.

&lt;p&gt;We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi-quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR-I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR-II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR-emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two-color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three-color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non-invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>

Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.

         <title>Stabilization of the Compressed Planar Benzene Dianion in Inverse&#8208;Sandwich Rare Earth Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, the capture of a planar antiaromatic benzene dianion in between two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations, each stabilized by two guanidinate ligands, is reported. The synthesized inverse&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#181;&#8211;&#414;6:&#414;6&#8211;C6H6), (RE = Y (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)) feature a remarkably planar benzene dianion, previously not encountered for any metal ion prone to low or absent covalency. The &#8208;2 charge localization at the benzene ligand was deduced from the results obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, spectroscopy, magnetometry, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the diamagnetic Y complex 1, the equivalent proton resonance of the bridging benzene dianion ligand is drastically shifted to higher field in comparison to free benzene. This and the calculated highly positive Nucleus&#8208;Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values are attributed to the antiaromatic character of the benzene dianion ligand. &#160;The crucial role of the ancillary guanidinate ligand scaffold in stabilizing the planar benzene dianion conformation was also elucidated by DFT calculations. Remarkably, the planarity of the benzene dianion originates from the stabilization of the &#960;&#8208;type orbitals of the d&#8208;manifold and compression through its strong electrostatic interaction with the two REIII sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics through Interfacial Environments Induced Surface Migration of Adsorbed Hydroxyl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing bifunctional sites through heterojunction engineering to accelerate water formation has become a pivotal strategy to improve the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, which is mainly focused on the synergistic effect of neighboring sites and the energetics of the surface reaction steps. However, the roles of the surface migration of key intermediates that go beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to neighboring atoms have usually been ignored. Using the heterostructured Ni3C&#8208;Ni catalyst as a model, we found that the rapid surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni component played a decisive role in facilitating water formation. Such unprecedented surface migration of OHad is induced by the large discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments of the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions. Benefiting from this, the resultant Ni3C&#8208;Ni exhibited outstanding mass activity for the alkaline HOR, which was approximately 19&#8208;fold and 21&#8208;fold higher than those of Ni and Ni3C, respectively. These findings not only provide novel insights into the alkaline HOR mechanism of heterostructured catalysts but also open new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency multi&#8208;mode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f&#8208;4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multi&#8208;mode luminescence and enhance NIR&#8208;II emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+&#8208;Cl&#8208; along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue&#8208;excitable (450 nm) NIR&#8208;II emission around 1541 nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7 times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 22.5%. This enhancement enables innovative applications such as two&#8208;dimensional information encryption by the multi&#8208;channel cooperative responses and improved NIR imaging. The study highlights the potential of Fe3+ doping in optimizing absorption and multi&#8208;mode luminescence in perovskites, opening avenues for advanced applications in blue&#8208;excitable NIR light emitting diodes, thermometer, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and NIR imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fischer&#8208;lactonization&#8208;driven mechanism for ultra&#8208;efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrometallurgy remains a major challenge to simplify its complex separation and precipitation processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein,&#160;we propose a Fischer&#8208;lactonisation&#8208;driven&#160;mechanism for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. Citric acid undergoes a two&#8208;step dissociation of the carboxylic acid (&#8208;COOH) and complexes with the leached metal ion, while the residual &#8208;COOH is attacked by H protons to form a protonated carboxyl ion (&#8208;COO^&#8208;). Subsequently, the lone pair of electrons in the hydroxyl of the same molecule attack the carbon atom in &#8208;COO^&#8208; to facilitate ester bonding, leading to the formation of a lactonized&#160;gel.&#160;The leaching rates of Li, Ni, Co and Mn are 99.3, 99.1, 99.5 and 99.2%, respectively.&#160;The regenerated&#160;monocrystalline&#160;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2&#160;(NCM523)&#160;has&#160;a uniform particle size distribution and complete lamellar structure,&#160;with a capacity retention rate of 70.6% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. The&#160;mechanism achieves a one&#8208;step chelation reaction, and the energy consumption and carbon emissions are only 26% and 44%, respectively, of that of the conventional hydrometallurgical.&#160;The strategy achieves a double breakthrough in simplifying the process and improving environmental friendliness, offering a sustainable approach to the re&#8208;utilization of spent LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient CRISPR/Cas Cooperative Shearing Platform for Clinical Diagnostics Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas&#8208;CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR&#8208;CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue&#8208;ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5 minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&#8722;20 M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR&#8208;CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Reduction and Functionalization by a Siloxide Supported Thulium&#8208;Potassium Complex for the formation of Ammonia or Hydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinitrogen (N2)&#160;chemistry of lanthanides remains less developed compared to the d&#8208;block metals and lanthanide&#8208;promoted N2&#160;functionalization chemistry in well&#8208;defined lanthanide complexes remains elusive.

Complex&#160;2&#160;provides a rare example of a metal complex of the triply reduced&#160;N23&#8208;&#160;radical.

         <title>Computational Stabilization of a Non&#8208;heme Iron Enzyme Enables Efficient Evolution of New Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep learning tools for enzyme design are rapidly emerging, and there is a critical need to evaluate their effectiveness in engineering workflows. Here we show that the deep learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially&#8208;relevant non&#8208;native functions. This superfamily has diverse catalytic functions and could provide a rich new source of biocatalysts for synthesis and industrial processes. Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8208;H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme. After three rounds of directed evolution, we obtained a 6&#8208;fold activity increase from the wild&#8208;type parent and an 80&#8208;fold increase from the stabilized variant. To generate the initial stabilized variant, we identified multiple structural and sequence constraints to preserve catalytic function. We applied these criteria to produce stabilized, catalytically active variants of a second Fe(II)/&#945;KG enzyme, suggesting that the approach is generalizable to additional members of the Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily. ProteinMPNN is user&#8208;friendly and widely&#8208;accessible, and our results provide a framework for the routine implementation of deep learning&#8208;based protein stabilization tools in directed evolution workflows for novel biocatalysts.</dc:description>

Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non-native, remote C(sp3)-H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Tandem Photocatalytic Methanation of CO2 by Lacunary Polyoxometalates&#8208;Stabilized *CO Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g&#8208;C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x = 12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80% and 40.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 evolution rate for PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. Conversely, g&#8208;C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process.  CO2 is initially activated on g&#8208;C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g&#8208;C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO.  However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g&#8208;C3N4 (x = 12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Prelithiation and Interface Protection to Achieve High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), particularly those with Li&#8208;free anodes or even anode&#8208;free configurations, have attracted extensive attention due to high safety and energy density. However, chemical&#8208;mechanical degradation typically deteriorates the cycle life and energy of Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs with the absence of Li inventory. Here, the prelithiation agent Li5FeO4 (LFO) coated Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide is developed as the cathode for Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs. The coated LFO acts as an interfacial protective layer to prevent the highly oxidizing Ni&#8208;rich cathode from reacting with sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the structural degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and the decomposition of SSE, resulting in excellent cycle life. Beneficial from the coated LFO in the cathode of the Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs, the reversible capacity improves from 174.7 mAh g&#8722;1 to 199.7 mAh g&#8722;1, and the capacity retention is enhanced from 33.8% to 84.8% after 100 cycles. Additionally, an ultrahigh energy density of 440 Wh kg&#8722;1, based on the mass of the composite cathode, Li&#8208;free anode, and SSE, is obtained in a Li&#8208;free anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell equipped with the LFO&#8208;coated cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Role  of Oxophilic Cr4+ in Cr&#8208;Cu2O Nanosheet Arrays for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuprous oxide (Cu2O)&#8208;based catalysts present a promising activity for the electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction to ammonia (eNO3RA), but the electrochemical instability of Cu+ species may lead to an unsatisfactory durability, hindering the exploration of the structure&#8208;performance relationship. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to stabilize Cu+ through the incorporation of Cr4+ into the Cu2O matrix to construct a Cr4+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ network structure. In situ and quasi&#8208;in situ characterizations reveal that the Cu+ species are well maintained via the strong Cr4+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ interaction that inhibits the leaching of lattice oxygen. Importantly, in situ generated Cr3+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ from Cr4+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ is identified as a dual&#8208;active site for eNO3RA, wherein the Cu+ sites are responsible for the activation of N&#8208;containing intermediates, while the assisting Cr3+ centers serve as the electron&#8208;proton mediators for rapid water dissociation. Theoretical investigations further demonstrated that the metastable state Cr3+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ favors the conversion from the endoergic hydrogenation of the key *ON intermediate to an exoergic reaction in an ONH pathway, and facilitates the subsequent NH3 desorption with a low energy barrier. The superior eNO3RA with a maximum 91.6% Faradaic efficiency could also be coupled with anodic sulfion oxidation to achieve concurrent NH3 production and sulfur recovery with reduced energy input.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to stabilize Cu+ through the incorporation of Cr4+ into the Cu2O matrix to construct a Cr4+-O-Cu+ network structure. In situ and quasi-in situ characterizations reveal that the Cu+ species are well maintained via the strong Cr4+-O-Cu+ interaction that inhibits the leaching of lattice oxygen.

         <title>A Metal Chelation Therapy to Effectively Eliminate Breast Cancer and Intratumor Bacteria While Suppressing Tumor Metastasis by Copper Depletion and Zinc Ions Surge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intratumor microbiota results in the immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. However, developing a synergistic therapy with antitumor, antibacterial, and antimetastatic effects faces enormous challenges. Here, we propose an&#160;metal chelation therapy to effectively eliminate tumor and intratumor bacteria and suppress tumor metastasis. Different from traditional chelation therapy that only consumes metal elements, this therapy not only eliminates the crucial metal elements for tumor metabolism but also releases new metal ions with antitumor and antibacterial properties. Based on the high demand for copper in breast cancer, we prepare a fibrous therapeutic nanoagent (Zn&#8208;PEN) by chelating&#160;D&#8208;Penicillamine (D&#8208;PEN) with Zn2+. Firstly, Zn&#8208;PEN achieves dual inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation&#160;and glycolysis metabolism &#160;through copper depletion and Zn2+ activated cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thus inducing tumor cell death. Secondly, Zn&#8208;PEN has the capability to eradicate Fusobacterium nucleatum&#160;in breast cancer, thereby mitigating its immunosuppressive impact on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, Zn&#8208;PEN effectively inhibits tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the inhibition of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, we verify the feasibility of Zn&#8208;PEN mediated metal chelation therapy in a 4T1 model infected with F. nucleatum, providing a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor metastasis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of (spiro)cyclobutane derivatives poses significant challenges yet holds promising applications for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. We report here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of alkynones to synthesize alkenyl cyclobutanols with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, delivering a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing rigid (spiro)carbocycle&#160;skeletons in good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 84% yield and 98.5:1.5 er). The synthetic utility is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into fused spirocycles. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is initiated by an active Ni&#8211;H species, with carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation as the key for regioselective control.&#160;This catalytic method provides a general solution for regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes&#160;and&#160;represents an efficient reaction pattern for assembling highly strained enantioenriched bioisosteres.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Mg2IrH6 Is Predicted to Be a High&#8208;Temperature Superconductor, But Ca2IrH6 Is Not</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The X2MH6 family, consisting of an electropositive cation X and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, has been predicted to hold promise for high&#8208;temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg2IrH6 and Ca2IrH6, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg2IrH6 the vibrations of the IrH64&#8208;&#160;anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the eg* set, which are antibonding between the H 1s and the Ir dx2&#8722;y2 or dz2 orbitals. Because calcium possesses low&#8208;lying d&#8208;orbitals, eg* &#8594; Ca d&#160;back&#8208;donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms and&#160;may hold implications for superconductivity in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.</dc:description>

         <title>Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reactivity with Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides for the Synthesis of Heteroaryl Sulfondiimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur functional groups are ubiquitous in molecules used in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and within these collections sulfones hold a prominent position. The double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfones, sulfondiimines, offer significant potential in discovery chemistry but to date their applications have been limited by the lack of convenient synthetic routes. The existing methods mainly rely on imination of low&#8208;valent&#8208;sulfur intermediates, or the combination of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents and electrophilic S(VI)&#8208;functionalities. Herein, we describe a Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides with (hetero)aryls. This new SuFEx reactivity benefits from broad functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and does not require the use of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents. The efficient use of unprotected indoles and pyrroles, as well as furan, thiophene and carbocyclic aromatics, further demonstrates the advantages of these reactions. We show that the reactivity of the sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be tuned by switching the N&#8208;substituents, allowing an expansion of the range of coupling partners. The utility of the transformation is exemplified by the synthesis of the sulfondiimine analogue of the HIV&#8208;I reverse transcriptase&#8208;inhibitor L&#8208;737,126.</dc:description>

We show that the reactivity of the sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be tuned by switching the N-substituents, allowing an expansion of the range of coupling partners. The utility of the transformation is exemplified by the synthesis of the sulfondiimine analogue of the HIV-I reverse transcriptase-inhibitor L-737,126.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Marine Amoebae&#8208;Inspired Salting Hydrogels to Reconfigure Anisotropy for Reprogrammable Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reprogrammable shape morphing is ubiquitous in living beings and highly crucial for them to move in normal situations, even to survive under dangerous conditions. There is increasing interest in using asymmetric hydrogel structures to understand and mimic living beings&#8217; shape morphing upon an external trigger in a controlled way. However, these asymmetric or heterogeneous configurations cannot be further modified once the polymer hydrogels are prepared. Therefore, it is a great challenge to achieve reprogrammable shape morphing using the existing hydrogels. Inspired by marine amoebae, which transform into several different morphologies according to the various external salt concentrations, a new strategy is developed for salting hydrogels to reconfigure their anisotropy toward reprogrammable shape morphing. Polyampholyte hydrogels with equal stoichiometric COO&#8210; and N+(CH3)3 groups were first swollen in HCl/NaCl solution. After being then transferred into water, they first swollen again by water uptake driven by the osmotic pressure, and then were spontaneously deswollen due to increase in internal pH and dialysis of ions leading to deprotonation of COOH to COO&#8210; and regeneration of COO&#8210;/N+(CH3)3 electrostatic attraction. This work provides a novel strategy to reconfigure anisotropy of hydrogel soft actuators and to open up an avenue for reprogrammable shape morphing.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;tough Dynamic Supramolecular Ion&#8208;conducting Elastomer Induced Uniform Li+ Transport and Stabilizes Interphase Ensures Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial polymer solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) with microphase&#8208;separated structures provide promising solutions to the inhomogeneity and cracking issues of natural SEIs in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, achieving homogeneous ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and superior interfacial stability remains challenging due to interference from hard&#8208;phase domains in ion transport and solid&#8208;solid interface issues with lithium metal. Herein, we present a dynamic supramolecular ion&#8208;conducting poly(urethane&#8208;urea) interphase (DSIPI) that achieves these three properties through modulating the hard&#8208;phase domains and constructing a composite SEI in situ. The soft&#8208;phase polytetrahydrofuran backbone, featuring loose Li+&#8208;O coordinating interactions, ensures uniform Li+ transport. Concurrently, sextuple hydrogen bonds in the hard phase dissipate strain energy through sequential bond cleavage, thereby imparting exceptional mechanical properties. Moreover, enriched bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8208;) in DSIPI promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of a stable polymer&#8208;inorganic composite SEI during cycling. Consequently, the DSIPI&#8208;protected lithium anode (DSIPI@Li) enables symmetric cells with exceptional cyclability exceeding 4,000 hours at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20 mA cm&#8208;2, thereby demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, DSIPI@Li facilitates stable operation of the pouch cells under the constraints of a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing artificial SEIs and high&#8208;performance LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Polarity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs grafted to polar functional group to activate CO2 has not been investigated in the context of CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we report a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to incorporate various functional groups in the MOFs. We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that the presence of polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution in the micropores of MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands reduces the energy barrier to generate *COOH, which is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2. Our research offers an effective method of disrupting local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO2 under electrochemical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Mediated f&#8208;p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling: Achieving Selective Seawater Oxidation and Breaking *OH and *OOH Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of materials for hydrogen production via seawater electrolysis at high current densities plays a crucial role in producing renewable hydrogen energy. However, during the seawater electrolysis process, the anode inevitably undergoes chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) due to Cl&#8208; adsorption, making the seawater electrolysis process difficult to sustain. Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we propose a biomimetic design of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) layers. Combining experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been demonstrated that cerium dioxide layers with FLPs sites can decompose water molecules, capture hydroxyl anions, and repel chloride ions simultaneously. DFT theoretical analysis indicates that the FLP sites regulate the Ce 4f&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Ni 3d gradient orbital coupling, providing additional oxygen non&#8208;bonding (ONB) to stabilize the Ni&#8208;O bond and optimize the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby breaking the *OH and *OOH scaling relationship. Assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7% at a current density of 0.1 A cm&#8208;2 and can stably operate for 250 hours at a current density of 0.2 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Knowledge&#8211;Data Dual&#8208;Driven Framework for Predicting the Molecular Properties of Rechargeable Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing rechargeable batteries that operate within a wide temperature range and possess high safety has become necessary with increasing demands. Rapid and accurate assessment of the melting points (MPs), boiling points (BPs), and flash points (FPs) of electrolyte molecules is essential for expediting battery development. Herein, we introduce Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI), a knowledge&#8211;data dual&#8208;driven framework for molecular property prediction of electrolytes. Initially, the KPI collects molecular structures and properties, and then automatically organizes them into structured datasets. Subsequently, interpretable machine learning further explores the structure&#8211;property relationships of molecules from a microscopic perspective. Finally, by embedding the discovered knowledge into property prediction models, the KPI achieved very low mean absolute errors of 10.4, 4.6, and 4.8 K for MP, BP, and FP predictions, respectively. The KPI reached state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art results in 18 out of 20 datasets. Utilizing molecular neighbor search and high&#8208;throughput screening, 15 and 14 promising molecules, with and without Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, respectively, were predicted for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range and high&#8208;safety batteries. The KPI not only accurately predicts molecular properties and deepens the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships but also serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and &#160;domain knowledge.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solid electrolytes (SEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are garnering considerable attention for their potential applications in next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Amorphous SEs with dual&#8208;anion hold great promise for achieving favorable performance, such as high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with electrodes within ASSBs. Here, we discover a family of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide SEs, Li3xMClyNx (M = Ta or La, 1 &#8804; 3x &#8804; 1.4, y = 5 or 3), which can achieve ionic conductivities up to 7.34 mS cm&#8210;1 at 30 &#176;C. The amorphous properties and local structures are investigated using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and atomic pair distribution function analysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <dc:description>We report a synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via an intramolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition of allylated cyclopropanes bearing a 4&#8208;nitrobenzimine substituent. Both activated and unactivated alkenes are tolerated in the transformation. The bicyclic imine products are prone to photo&#8208;induced ring opening, allowing for the epimerization of C5&#8208;stereogenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their application is limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and negatively shift the redox potentials of quinone material. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7 meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex&#8208;situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500 cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8208;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Cluster&#8208;based Spin Crossover Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster&#8208;based spin crossover (SCO) frameworks are a new class of smart metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse structures and topologies and unique bistable physicochemical properties. Here, we report a cluster&#8208;based SCO framework [Fe3{Ag4(CN)6(H2O)}2(TPBA)3](ClO4)2&#183;7DMF (1) with an extremely rare 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology, in which the tripodal [Ag{Ag(CN)2}3(H2O)]2&#8722; clusters axially link the Fe2+ ions to form 2D&#8594;3D n&#8208;fold Borromean entangled networks. Under the guidance of reticular chemistry, the post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) from 1 with 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology to [Fe3{Ag8X8(CN)6}(TPBA)3] (2_X, X = Cl, Br, I) with urk topology is firstly achieved via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Moreover, the successive SCSC transformations from 2_Cl to 2_Br and then to 2_I are realized for the first time. Their SCO behaviors are also modified by halogen&#8208;driven stepwise cluster transformations. Hence, these findings provide new strategies for the development of cluster&#8208;based SCO MOFs towards the smart functional porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unleashed Remarkable Energy Storage Performance in Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based Relaxor Ferroelectrics by Local Structural Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric capacitors harvest energy through an electrostatic&#160;process, which enables an ultrafast charging&#8208;discharging rate and ultrahigh power density. However, achieving high energy density (Wrec) and efficiency (&#951;) simultaneously, especially when preserving them across a wide frequency/temperature range or cycling numbers, remains challenging. In this work, by especially introducing NaTaO3 into the representative ferroelectric relaxor of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 and leveraging the mismatch between B&#8208;site atoms, we proposed a method of enhancing local structural fluctuation to refine the polar configuration and to effectively improve its overall energy&#8208;storage performances. As a consequence, the ceramic exhibits an ultrahigh Wrec of 15.0 J/cm3 and high &#951; up to 80%, along with a very wide frequency stability of 10 &#8211; 200 Hz and extensive cycling number up to 108. In&#8208;depth local structure and chemical environment investigations, consisting of atom&#8208;scale electron microscopy, neutron total scattering, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, reveal that the randomly distributed A/B&#8208;site atom pairs emerge in the system, leading to the evident local structural fluctuations and concomitant polymorphic polar nanodomains.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dielectric capacitors harvest energy through an electrostatic&#160;process, which enables an ultrafast charging-discharging rate and ultrahigh power density. However, achieving high energy density (Wrec) and efficiency (&#951;) simultaneously, especially when preserving them across a wide frequency/temperature range or cycling numbers, remains challenging. In this work, by especially introducing NaTaO3 into the representative ferroelectric relaxor of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 and leveraging the mismatch between B-site atoms, we proposed a method of enhancing local structural fluctuation to refine the polar configuration and to effectively improve its overall energy-storage performances. As a consequence, the ceramic exhibits an ultrahigh Wrec of 15.0 J/cm3 and high &#951; up to 80%, along with a very wide frequency stability of 10 &#8211; 200 Hz and extensive cycling number up to 108. In-depth local structure and chemical environment investigations, consisting of atom-scale electron microscopy, neutron total scattering, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, reveal that the randomly distributed A/B-site atom pairs emerge in the system, leading to the evident local structural fluctuations and concomitant polymorphic polar nanodomains. These key ingredients contribute to the large polarization, minimal hysteresis, and high breakdown strength, thereby promoting energy-storage performances. This work opens a new path for designing high-performance dielectric capacitors via manipulating local structural fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8722;H (E=H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a bulky amino substituent at phosphorous enables the development of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene. This compound serves as an efficient phosphinidene synthon, thermally releasing transient phosphinidenes shown to activate dihydrogen (H2), E&#8722;H (E=Si, N and P) bonds and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 (A=anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8722;H (E=Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol&#160;Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that&#160;of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters:&#160; collective rearrangements are&#160;3 times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can&#160;boost&#160;reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can&#160;boost&#160;reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH-groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen-bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant-solvent hydrogen bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Oxide Clusters as Electron Donors Under Light Enhance Oxygen Reduction Kinetics at Atomically Dispersed Fe for Photocatalytic CH4 Partial Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to CH3OH emerges as a promising strategy to sustainably utilize natural gas and mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, there remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of methanol by using O2 at low temperature. Inspired by the catalytic structure in soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) and the corresponding reaction mechanism, we prepared a biomimetic photocatalysts with the decoration of Fe2O3 nanocluster and satellite Fe single atom immobilized on carbon nitride. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity of 5.02 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with methanol selectivity of 98.5%. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergy between Fe2O3 nanocluster and Fe single atom establishes a dual&#8208;Fe site as MMO for O2 activation and subsequent CH4 partial oxidation. Moreover, the light excitation of Fe2O3&#160;nanoclusters with a relative narrow bandgap could deliver the electrons and protons to atomic Fe that facilitating the oxygen reduction kinetics for the robust of methanol synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhomogeneous Coordination in High&#8208;entropy O3&#8208;type Cathodes Enables Suppressed Slab Gliding and Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O3&#8208;type layered oxides are highly promising cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), however they undergo complex phase transitions and exhibit high sensibility to air, leading to subpar cycling performance and commercial viability. In this work, we report a layered cathode material (NaNi0.29Cu0.1Mg0.05Li0.05Mn0.2Ti0.2Sn0.11O2) with a sate&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;entropy compositional design. We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metal (TM) elements, can enable enhanced gliding energy (&#8208;0.38 vs &#8208;0.58 eV) of TMO2 slabs upon desodiation both theoretically and experimentally, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials. As a consequence, the complex phase transitions (O3&#8208;O'3&#8208;P3&#8208;P'3&#8208;P3'&#8208;O3') of conventional O3&#8208;type cathode have been eliminated, and the as&#8208;obtained material demonstrates exceptional structural robustness and integrity with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life in a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cell (maintaining 73.2% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C). Moreover, the material presents satisfactory air stability, with minimal structural and electrochemical degradation when directly exposed to the air. An Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell based on the cathode material is constructed, demonstrating a capacity retention of 83.6% after 500 cycles, signaling substantial promise for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strontium Doped IrOx Triggers Direct O&#8208;O Coupling to Boost Acid Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2&#8208;assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium&#8208;doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8208;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8208;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8208;IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8208;IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72 V at 1 A cm&#8208;2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500 hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Based on a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer towards Amplified Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have been attaching wide attention in the field of optical information storage and encryption, while still facing the challenge of the realization of high&#160;luminescence dissymmetry&#160;factors (glum). This work presents a pair of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral co&#8208;assemblies P7R3 and P7S3 by combining polymer PFIQ containing iso&#8208;quinoline units with chiral inducers. The obtained chiral co&#8208;assemblies can reversibly undergo significant modification in CPL behavior under trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) fumigation and annealing treatment, with the |glum| values exhibiting a reversible shift between 0.2 and 0.3. Moreover, the chiral co&#8208;assemblies before TFA fumigating can effectively induce achiral emitters to generate intense full&#8208;color CPL signals through CPL energy transfer (CPL&#8208;ET), with the corresponding |glum| values larger than 0.2. Moreover, information encryption and decryption as well as a multi&#8208;level logic gates application are achieved by leveraging the reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL activity of the chiral co&#8208;assembly. This work provides a new perspective for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral luminescent materials with large |glum| values and the activation of CPL behavior in achiral emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Fluorescence Polyelectrolyte Nanoassemblies: Manipulate and Boost Singlet Oxygen in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved therapeutic modality that has shown great potential for cancer treatment. However, there exist two major problems hindering PDT applications: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Herein, we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling (photo&#8208;triggered PPN) strategy, in which porphyrin photosensitizer and photoswitchable energy accepter are assembled into polyelectrolyte micelles by a combined force of charge interaction and metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The polyelectrolyte&#8208;based PPN exhibits good biocompatibility, and bestows a unique "confining isolated" inner microenvironment for fully overcoming the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of porphyrins with significant photodynamic efficiency (123&#8208;fold enhancement). Due to the high F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (91.5%) between porphyrin and photoswitch in closed&#8208;form, we could use light as a specific trigger to modulate photoswitch between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;form, and manipulate the 1O2 generation in three stages: pre&#8208;PDT (quenching 1O2 generation), during PDT (activating 1O2 generation), and post&#8208;PDT (silencing 1O2 generation). This de novo strategy has for the first time realized remotely manipulating and boosting 1O2 generation in PDT, well resolving the critical and general challenges of limited photodynamic efficiency and side effects from nonspecific phototoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Dipoles Tailoring Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Chemistry to Enable Reversible Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a decisive role in building reliable Li metal batteries. However, the scarcity of anions in Helmholtz layer (HL) caused by electrostatic repulsion usually leads to the inferior SEI derived from solvents, resulting in dendrites and &#8216;dead&#8217; Li. Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions&#8208;derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO&#8208;BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI&#8208; and NO3&#8208; into anion&#8208;defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO&#8208;BTO (10 mAh cm&#8208;2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700 h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P=~6.3) using rGO&#8208;BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.</dc:description>

Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions-derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO-BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI- and NO3- into anion-defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast-Li+-transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO-BTO (10 mAh cm-2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700 h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P=~6.3) using rGO-BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;dense Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt; 3 mAh cm&#8208;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4 V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61 V with a specific energy of 316.5 Wh kg&#8208;1&#8208;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of High&#8208;Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH&#8722;/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>After half a century from their isolation in 1974, we report the first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, two dimeric pyranonaphthoquinones featuring an unusual bicyclo[3.2.1]&#8208;octadienone core. The syntheses were achieved with full stereochemical control and functional group management, relying on 1) enantioselective construction of the bicyclic core by Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition followed by thiolate&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization, and 2) judicious design of a common chiral, non&#8208;racemic monomer unit that is capable of divergence into the donor and acceptor units, and reunion to construct the bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone core.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving Structures of Paramagnetic Systems in Chemistry and Materials Science by Solid&#8208;State NMR: the Revolving Power of Ultra&#8208;Fast MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100+ kHz) has revolutionized solid&#8208;state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast&#8208;spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, and are associated with lower sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here these difficulties are overcome by improvements in rotor ceramics and handling methods that enable the routine use of this setup for repetitive, high&#8208;throughput analysis of sensitive samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra&#8208;fast 100+ kHz MAS allows site&#8208;specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. This opens the way to routine characterisation of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb3+ complex, an air&#8208;sensitive homogeneous high&#8208;spin Fe2+ catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe2+/Mn2+/Mg2+ olivine&#8208;type cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control over the movement of electrons during chemical reactions with oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) has been predicted to offer a general approach to catalysis. Recently, we suggested that many problems to realize electric&#8208;field catalysis in practice under scalable bulk conditions could possibly be solved on multiwalled carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic reactors. Here, we selected monoterpene cyclizations to assess the scope of our system in organic synthesis. We report that electric&#8208;field catalysis can function by stabilizing both anionic and cationic transition states, depending on the orientation of the applied field. Moreover, electric&#8208;field catalysis can promote reactions which are barely accessible by general Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids and field&#8208;free anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products without the need for pyrene interfacers attached to the substrate to prolong binding to the carbon nanotubes. Finally, interfacing with chiral organocatalysts is explored and evidence against contributions from redox chemistry is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring d&#8209;Band Center of Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Sites for Boosted Photocatalytic Reduction of Diluted CO2 from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of diluted CO2 from anthropogenic sources holds tremendous potential for achieving carbon neutrality, while the huge barrier to forming *COOH key intermediate considerably limits catalytic effectiveness. Herein, via coordination engineering of atomically scattered Ni sites in conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs), we propose a facile strategy for tailoring the d&#8209;band center of metal active sites towards high&#8208;efficiency photoreduction of diluted CO2. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in pure CO2, CMOFs with Ni&#8208;O4 sites (Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs) exhibits an outstanding rate for CO generation of 13.3 &#956;mol h&#8211;1 with a selectivity of 94.5%, which is almost double that of its isostructural counterpart with traditional Ni&#8208;N4 sites (Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs), outperforming most reported systems under comparable conditions. Interestingly, in simulated flue gas, the CO selectivity of Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs decreases significantly while that of Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs is mostly unchanged, signifying the supremacy for Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs in leveraging anthropogenic diluted CO2. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) investigations demonstrate that O coordination can move the center of the Ni sites' d&#8208;band closer to the Fermi level, benefiting the generation of *COOH key intermediate as well as the desorption of *CO and hence leading to significantly boosted activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Thin Zinc Electrodes Stabilized with Organobromine&#8208;Partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH Cluster Ions for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of thin zinc (Zn) anodes with a high depth of discharge is an effective strategy to increase the energy density of aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs), but challenged by the poor reversibility of Zn electrode due to the serious Zn&#8208;consuming side reactions at the Zn||electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (BDOL) and methanol (MeOH) as electrolyte additive into aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the as&#8208;formulated electrolyte, BDOL with a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group (&#8722;CH2Br) tends to pair with the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex, leading to the formation of organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ions. During the Zn electrodeposition process, the formed ZnO&#8208;dominated by&#8208;products induce the polymerization of BDOL monomers, which are previously adsorbed on the electrode. As a result, a uniform dual&#8208;layer SEI with ZnO&#8208;dominated outer layer and polyether&#8208;dominated inner layer is built on the surface of Zn electrode. With such an in&#8208;situ formed dual&#8208;layer SEI, the Zn||Mg0.9Mn3O7&#183;2.7H2O pouch cell using a 10&#8208;um Zn anode (corresponding to a low negative to positive areal capacity ratio of 3.56) successfully operated for 300 cycles with a high capacity retention of 86%, promising a high practical energy density of &gt; 120 Wh/kg (based on the total mass of Zn and Mg0.9Mn3O7&#183;2.7H2O).</dc:description>

         <title>Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters via a &#8220;Reserve&#8208;Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low&#8208;strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi&#8208;crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain&#8208;induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy&#8208;dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape&#8208;memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios. This work and the &#8220;reserve&#8208;release&#8221; crystallization strategy herein highlight the double crystalline multiblock chain architecture as a potential avenue towards reconciling the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off in thermoplastic elastomers and can possibly be extended to other biodegradable building blocks to deliver functional materials with diverse mechanical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>End&#8208;extended Conjugation Strategy to Reduce the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Mechanical Robustness Gap in Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concurrently achieving high efficiency, mechanical robustness and thermal stability is critical for the commercialization of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (APSCs). However, APSCs usually demonstrate complicated morphology, primarily attributed to the polymer chain entanglement which has a detrimental effect on their fill factors (FF) and morphology stability. To address these concerns, an end&#8208;group extended polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;NFT, was synthesized and studied. The morphology analysis showed a tightly ordered molecular packing mode and a favorable phase separation was formed. The PM6:PY&#8208;NFT&#8208;based device achieved an exceptional PCE of 19.12% (certified as 18.45%), outperforming the control PM6:PY&#8208;FT devices (17.14%). This significant improvement highlights the record&#8208;high PCE for binary APSCs. The thermal aging study revealed that the PM6:PY&#8208;NFT blend exhibited excellent morphological stability, thereby achieving superior device stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after enduring thermal stress (65 &#176;C) for 1500 hours. More importantly, the PM6:PY&#8208;NFT blend film exhibited outstanding mechanical ductility with a crack onset strain of 24.1%. Overall, rational chemical structure innovation, especially the conjugation extension strategy to trigger appropriate phase separation and stable morphology, is the key to achieving high efficiency, improved thermal stability and robust mechanical stability of APSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting WLED&#8208;Excited High Temperature Long Afterglow by Orthogonally Anchoring Chromophores into 0D Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow materials have garnered significant interest due to distinct photophysical characteristics. However, it is still difficult to achieve long afterglow phosphorescence from organic molecules due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and energy dissipation. In addition, most materials reported so far have long afterglow emission only at room or even low temperatures, and mainly use UV light as an excitation source. In this work, we report a strategy to achieve high temperature long afterglow emission through the assembly of isolated 0D metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). In which, both ACQ and phosphorescence quenching effects are effectively mitigated by altering the stacking mode of organic chromophores through orthogonally anchoring into the edges of cubic MOCs. Furthermore, improvement in molecular rigidity, promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling and broadening of the absorption range are achieved through the MOC&#8208; engineering strategy. As a result, we successfully synthesized MOCs that can produce afterglow emission even after excitation by WLEDs at high temperatures (380 K). Moreover, the MOCs are capable of generating afterglow emissions when excited by mobile phone flashlight at room temperature. Given these features, the potential applications of MOCs in the visual identification of explosives, information encryption and multicolor display are explored.</dc:description>

         <title>n&#8208;ZrS3/p&#8208;ZrOS Photoanodes with NiOOH/FeOOH Oxygen Evolution Catalysts for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical water splitting offers a promising approach for carbon neutrality, but its commercial prospects are still hampered by a lack of efficient and stable photoelectrodes with earth&#8208;abundant materials. Here, we report a strategy to construct an efficient photoanode with a coaxial nanobelt structure, comprising a buried&#8208;ZrS3/ZrOS n&#8208;p junction, for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The p&#8208;type ZrOS layer, formed on the surface of the n&#8208;type ZrS3 nanobelt through a pulsed&#8208;ozone&#8208;treatment method, acts as a hole collection layer for hole extraction and a protective layer to shield the photoanode from photocorrosion. The resulting ZrS3/ZrOS photoanode exhibits light harvesting with good photo&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiencies across the whole visible region to over 650&#8201;nm. By further employing NiOOH/FeOOH as the oxygen evolution reaction cocatalyst, the ZrS3/ZrOS/NiOOH/FeOOH photoanode yields a photocurrent density of ~9.3 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode with an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of ~3.2% under simulated sunlight irradiation in an alkaline solution (pH = 13.6). The conformal ZrOS layer enables ZrS3/ZrOS/NiOOH/FeOOH photoanode operation over 1000 hours in an alkaline solution without obvious performance degradation. This study, offering a promising approach to fabricate efficient and durable photoelectrodes with earth&#8208;abundant materials, advances the frontiers of photoelectrochemical water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>The Regulation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Composite Lithium Anodes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. However, the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal/SPE interface is a major challenge, as continuous SEI degradation and regeneration during cycling lead to capacity fading. This article investigates the SEI formation on lithium anodes (l&#8208;SEI) and composite lithium anodes (c&#8208;SEI) in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The composite anodes form a uniform Li2S&#8208;rich inorganic SEI layer and a thinner organic SEI layer, effectively passivating the interface for enhanced cycling stability. Specifically, the full cells with c&#8208;SEI anodes sustain over 400 cycles at 0.5 C under a high areal capacity of 2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the reversible high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state pouch cells exhibit exceptional safety even after curling and cutting.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are highly promising for next-generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. However, the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal/SPE interface is a major challenge, as continuous SEI degradation and regeneration during cycling lead to capacity fading. This article investigates the SEI formation on lithium anodes (l-SEI) and composite lithium anodes (c-SEI) in solid-state lithium metal batteries. The composite anodes form a uniform Li2S-rich inorganic SEI layer and a thinner organic SEI layer, effectively passivating the interface for enhanced cycling stability. Specifically, the full cells with c-SEI anodes sustain over 400 cycles at 0.5 C under a high areal capacity of 2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the reversible high-loading solid-state pouch cells exhibit exceptional safety even after curling and cutting. These findings offer valuable insights into developing composite electrodes with robust SEI for solid-state polymer-based lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Pore Wall Chemistry Empowers Sonodynamic Activity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Pro&#8208;Oxidative Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered growing attracted interest in the field of biomedicine; however, their application in sonodynamic therapy remains underexplored due to limited understanding of their intrinsic activity and structure&#8208;property relationships. Here, we present a pore wall chemistry modulation strategy for empowering sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF heterojunctions through in situ growth of COFs on bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets (B NSs). Compared to the negligible sonodynamic effects observed in the pristine B NSs, the 2D heterojunction with vinyl&#8208;decorated COF pore walls demonstrates a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in sonocatalytic singlet oxygen generation. This performance also significantly outperforms that of isoreticular COFs functionalized with methoxy or non&#8208;substituted groups. Mechanistic studies reveal that the vinyl groups in the BC heterojunction facilitate the separation and transfer of charge carriers while also enhancing the adsorption of oxygen molecules. Furthermore, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) loading into the porous COFs boosts the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor nanotherapy via sonocatalytic dual oxidative species generation. These findings underscore the critical role of pore wall chemistry in modulating the sonocatalytic properties of COFs, and advance the development of COF&#8208;based sonosensitizers for pro&#8208;oxidative applications.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.







Abstract
Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.

         <title>Unlocking Mechanism of Anion and Cation Interaction on Ion Conduction of Polymer Based Electrolyte in Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply it in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li+ is critical for high Li+ transfer number (tLi+) and ionic conductivity of electrolyte. As a result, poly(2,2,3,3&#8722;tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (PTFM) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) shows an ionic conductivity of 0.78 mS cm&#8722;1 and a tLi+ of 0.85, much higher than those of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) without EWG. Moreover, PTFM based GPE shows excellent flame retardancy property. Li||PTFM||NCM811 batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 5.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 show stable cycles of 5 times to that of Li||PMMA||NCM811. Moreover, the assembled graphite||PTFM||NCM811 pouch cell shows a capacity retention rate of 92% after 500 cycles. This work clarifies the mechanism of cation||anion interaction on ionic conductivity of GPE, which is important to develop high&#8208;performance devices with good safety and flexibility.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208; and few&#8208;layer graphene&#8208;based thermal interface materials (TIMs) with extraordinary high&#8208;temperature resistance and ultra&#8208;high thermal conductivity are very essential to develop the next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. However, the function of the as&#8208;prepared graphene&#8208;based TIMs would undergo severe degradation when being transferred to chips, as the interface between the TIMs and chips possesses a very small interfacial thermal conductance. Here, a &#8220;2.5D&#8221; all&#8208;carbon interface containing rich covalent bonding, namely a sp2/sp3 hybrid interfaces is designed and realized by a plasma&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition with a function of ultra&#8208;rapid quenching. The interfacial thermal conductance of the 2.5D interface is excitingly very high, up to 110&#8208;117 MWm&#8208;2K&#8208;1 at graphene thickness of 12&#8208;25 nm, which is even more than 30% higher than various metal/diamond contacts, and orders of magnitude higher than the existing all&#8208;carbon contacts. Atomic&#8208;level simulation confirm the key role of the efficient heat conduction via covalent C&#8208;C bonds, and reveal that the covalent&#8208;based heat transport could contribute 85% to the total interfacial conduction at a hybridization degree of 22 at%. This study provides an efficient strategy to design and construct 2.5D all&#8208;carbon interfaces, which can be used to develop high performance all&#8208;carbon devices and circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N Arylation using Alternating Polarity in Flow for Compound Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Etherification and amination of aryl halide scaffolds are commonly used reactions in parallel medicinal chemistry to rapidly scan structure&#8208;activity relationships with abundant building blocks. Electrochemical methods for aryl etherification and amination demonstrate broad functional group tolerance and extended nucleophile scope compared to traditional methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for robust and scale&#8208;transferable workflows for electrochemical compound library synthesis. Herein we describe a platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of C&#8208;X arylation (X = NH, OH) in flow to access compound libraries. A comprehensive Design of Experiment (DoE) study identifies an optimal protocol which generates high yields across &gt; 30 aryl halide scaffolds, diverse amines (including electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). Reaction sequences are automated on commercially available equipment to generate libraries of anilines and aryl ethers. The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid accumulating electrode passivation. Moreover, it enables reactions to be performed in air, without supporting electrolyte and with high reproducibility over consecutive runs. Our method represents a powerful means to rapidly generate nucleophile independent C&#8208;X arylation compound libraries using flow electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Bio Hybrids for Selective Photobiocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system (SAPS) that combines enzymes or cellular organisms with light&#8208;absorbing semiconductors, has emerged as an attractive approach for nitrogen conversion, yet faces the challenge of reaction pathway regulation. Herein, we find that photoelectrons can transfer from the &#8208;C&#8801;N groups at the edge of cyano&#8208;rich carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN) to nitrate reductase (NarGH), while the direct electron transfer to nitrite reductase (cd1NiR) is inhibited due to the physiological distance limit of active sites (&gt; 14 &#197;). By means of the directional electron transfer between g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN and extracted biological enzymes, the product of the denitrification reaction was switched from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3%. The converted nitrite could be further utilized by anammox microbiota and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) microorganisms, doubling the efficiency of total nitrogen removal (96.5 &#177; 2.3 %) for biological nitrogen removal and ammonia generation (12.6 mg NH4+&#8208;N L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), respectively. Thus, our work paves an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate for ammonia fuel production by strategically regulating the electron transfer pathway across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8208;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8208;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8208;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8208;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 || graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45 g Ah&#8208;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2% after 200 cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonds in Organic Cathode Materials to Realize Ultra&#8208;stable, Flexible and Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of molecular structures is one of the effective strategies to obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials. However, besides the optimization of single&#8208;molecule structures, the influence of the "weak" interaction forces (e.g. hydrogen bonds) in organic cathode materials on the performance of batteries should be fully considered. Herein, three organic small molecules with different numbers of hydroxyl groups (namely nitrogen heterocyclic tetraketone (DAB), monohydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (HDA), dihydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (DHT)) were selected as the cathodes of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), and the effect of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds on their electrochemical performance was studied for the first time. Clearly, the stable hydrogen&#8208;bond networks built through the hydroxyl groups significantly enhance the cycle stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes and facilitate rapid proton conduction between the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks through the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby endowing them with excellent rate performance. In addition, a larger and more dense two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bond network can be constructed through multiple hydroxyl groups, further enhancing the structural stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes, giving them better cycle tolerance, excellent rate performance, and extreme environmental tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Interfacial Assembly: Integrating Supramolecular Hosts into Polymeric Membranes through an Aqueous Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient incorporation of supramolecular hosts in polymeric membranes can impart the overall matrix with new properties for a range of cutting&#8208;edge applications. Here, we introduce a Supramolecular Interfacial Assembly (SIA) method for the fabrication of polymeric membranes featuring embedded macrocycles. Through harnessing the quasi&#8208;liquid nature of the concentrated polymer solution, SIA orchestrates the homogenous spreading of macrocycles in an aqueous layer on its surface, leading to the creation of an interface between &#8220;water/water&#8221; phases, subsequently forming a cross&#8208;linked membrane driven by supramolecular electrostatic interactions. Remarkably, compared to the traditional interfacial polymerization, SIA adheres to a &#8220;green&#8221; paradigm without the need for organic solvents. The resultant composite membrane exhibits superior performance in organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), owing to the precise molecular sieving property provided by the macrocycles with well&#8208;defined permanent cavities. This fabrication method holds great promise for the innovative design of composite membranes, which can greatly impact the production of smart membrane materials for advanced technology applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II  Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence Nanocrystals with 1710 nm Excitation for in vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anti&#8208;Stokes luminescence (ASL) based on lanthanide nanocrystals holds immense promise for in vivo optical imaging and bio&#8208;detection, which benefits from filtered autofluorescence. However, the current longest emission and excitation wavelengths of lanthanide ASL system were shorter than 1200 nm and 1532 nm, respectively, which limited tissue penetration depth and caused low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of in vivo imaging due to tissue scattering and water absorption. In this work, we extended the excitation wavelength to 1710 nm with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) emission up to 1650 nm through a novel ASL nanocrystal LiYF4:10%Tm@LiYF4:70%Er@LiYF4. Compared with 1532 nm excited ASL nanoprobes, the 1710 nm excited nanocrystals could improve in vivo imaging SNR by 12.72 folds. Based on this excellent imaging performance of the proposed ASL nanoprobes, three&#8208;channel in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging was achieved, which quantitatively revealed metabolic rates of intestinal dynamics and liver enrichment under anesthetized and awake states. This innovative ASL nanoprobes and dynamic multiplexed imaging technology would be conducive to optimizing dosing regimen and treatment plans across various physiological conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Active Sites with Charge&#8208;asymmetry in Organic Semiconductors Promoting C&#8208;C Coupling for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and energy shortage, but it is still highly challenging due to the large energy barrier of the C&#8208;C coupling step and severe exciton annihilation in photocatalysts. Herein, strong and localized charge polarization is successfully induced on the surface of melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors by creating dual active sites with a large charge asymmetry. Confirmed by multiscale characterization and theoretical simulations, such asymmetric charge distribution, originated from the oxygen dopants and nitrogen vacancies over melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors, reduces exciton binding energy and boosts exciton dissociation. The as&#8208;formed charge polarization sites not only donate electrons to CO2 molecules but also accelerate the coupling of asymmetric *CO*CO intermediates for CO2 photoreduction into ethanol by lowering the energy barrier of this process. Consequently, an exceptionally high selectivity of up to 97% for C2H5OH and C2H5OH yield of 0.80 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 have been achieved on this dual active sites organic semiconductor. This work, with its potential applicability to a variety of non&#8208;metal multi&#8208;site catalysts, represents a versatile strategy for the development of advanced catalysts tailored for CO2 photoreduction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Programmable DNA&#8208;Encoded Pre&#8208;PROTACs for Cell&#8208;Selective and Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have accelerated drug development; however, some challenges still exist owing to their lack of tumor selectivity and on&#8208;demand protein degradation. Here, we developed a miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform that enables the on&#8208;demand activation and termination of target degradation in a cell type&#8208;specific manner. Using miRNA&#8208;21 as a model, we engineered DNA hairpins labeled with JQ&#8208;1 and pomalidomide and facilitated the modular assembly of DNA&#8208;encoded pre&#8208;PROTACs through a hybridization chain reaction. This configuration promoted the selective polyubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 upon miR&#8208;21 initiation, highlighting significant tumor selectivity and minimal systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the platform incorporates photolabile groups, enabling the precise optical control of pre&#8208;PROTACs during DNA assembly/disassembly, mitigating the risk of excessive protein degradation. Additionally, by introducing a secondary ligand targeting CDK6, these pre&#8208;PROTACs were used as a modular scaffold for the programmable assembly of active miRiaTACs containing two different warheads in exact stoichiometry, enabling orthogonal multitarget degradation. The integration of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy through an upconversion nanosystem further enhanced the efficacy of the platform with potent in vivo anticancer activity. We anticipate that miRiaTAC represents a significant intersection between dynamic DNA nanotechnology and PROTAC, potentially expanding the versatility of PROTAC toolkit for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High Efficiency Alkaline Iodine Batteries with Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Enabled by Bi/Bi2O3 Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;electron transfer I&#8208;/IO3&#8208; redox couple is attractive for high energy aqueous batteries. Shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte significantly enhances the IO3&#8208; formation kinetics due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction, while the alkaline environment also offers more favorable Zn anode compatibility. However, sluggish kinetics during the reduction of IO3&#8208; persists in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, compromising the energy efficiency of this glorious redox couple. Here, we establish the fundamental redox mechanism of the I&#8208;/IO3&#8208; couple in alkaline electrolytes for the first time and propose that Bi/Bi2O3 acts as a redox mediator (RM) to &#8220;catalyze&#8221; the reduction of IO3&#8208;. This mediation significantly reduces the voltage gap between charge/discharge from 1.6 V to 1 V with improved conversion efficiency and rate capability. By pairing the Zn anode and the Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode, the full battery with I&#8208;/IO3&#8208; redox mechanism achieves high areal capacity of 12 mAh cm&#8208;2 and stable operation at 5 mAh cm&#8208;2 for over 400 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Phase Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;Situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem solid&#8208;solution phase post&#8208;synthetic modifications were realized based on porous molecular crystals. The sequential reactions involve addition reaction with hydrazine hydrate and condensation reaction with alkyl aldehydes, resulting in the production of three molecular frameworks in a quantitative manner, accompanied by solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow).







Abstract
Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution phase reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol with O2 over Photoinduced Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich WO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct photocatalytic conversion of benzene to phenol with O2 is a green alternative to the traditional synthesis. The key is to find an effective photocatalyst to do the trick. Defect engineering of semiconductors with oxygen vacancies (OVs) is an emerging strategy for catalyst fabrication. OVs can trap electrons to promote charge separation and serving as adsorption sites for O2 activation. However,&#160;randomly distribution of OVs on the semiconductor surface often results in mismatching the charge carrier dynamics under irradiation, thus failing to fulfill the unique advantages of OVs for photoredox functions. Herein, we demonstrate that abundant OVs can be facilely generated and precisely located adjacent to the reductive sites on reducible oxide semiconductors such as tungsten oxide (WO3) via a simple photochemistry strategy. Such photoinduced OVs are well suited for photocatalytic benzene oxidation with O2 as they readily capture photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites of WO3 to activate adsorbed O2. 18O&#8208;labeling experiments further confirm that the OVs also facilitate the integration of oxygen atoms from O2 into phenol, revealing in detail the pathway for photocatalytic benzene hydroxylation. This study demonstrates that the photochemistry approach is an appealing strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance OVs&#8208;rich photocatalysts for solar&#8208;induced chemical conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Atomically&#8208;Precise Pt Sites for Boosting Light&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic structure of Pt single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitates robust electronic interactions with the substrate, providing an optimal spatial and electronic framework for activating and converting CO2&#8722;CH4 molecules. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, highlighting the critical role of atomically&#8208;precise interface adjustment in multi&#8208;molecule systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically&#8208;precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO2 surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically-precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters. The configuration comprising single atoms and sub-nanoclusters engenders pronounced electronic metal-support interactions, with resultant interfacial states prompting surface charge rearrangement. The unique geometric and electronic properties of these atom-cluster assemblies facilitate effective activation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, accelerating intermediate coupling and minimizing side reactions. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with superior durability, displaying high apparent quantum yield of 9.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and turnover frequency of 1289&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH 1&#8208;14 as amides and from pH 1&#8208;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8208;O&#8208;M (M: Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8208;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8208;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as further verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis.&#160;18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry directly demonstrates that oxygen originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8208;NiCo2O4 during OER. It is discovered that electron delocalization of Ce 4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8208;O bonding in [Ce&#8208;O&#8208;Ni] site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst energetic and kinetic aspects of folding processes are meanwhile well understood for natural biomacromolecules, the folding dynamics in so far studied artificial foldamer counterparts remain largely unexplored. This is due to the low energy barriers between their conformational isomers that make the dynamic processes undetectable with conventional methods such as UV/vis absorption, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy, making such processes &#8216;invisible&#8217;. Here we present an asymmetric perylene bisimide dimer (bis&#8208;PBI 1) that possesses conformational chirality in its folded state. Owing to the large interconversion barrier (&#8805; 116 kJ mol&#8211;1), four stereoisomers could be separated and isolated. Since the interconversion between these stereoisomers requires the foldamer to first open and then to re&#8208;fold, the transformation of one stereoisomer into others allowed us to &#8216;visualize&#8217; the dynamics of folding with time and determine its lifetimes and the energetic barriers associated with the folding process. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, we identified the open structure to be only a fleeting metastable state of higher energy. Our experimental observation of the kinetics associated with the molecular dynamics in the PBI foldamer advances the fundamental understanding of folding in synthetic foldamers and paves the way for the design of smart functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of redox&#8208;active bipyridinium ligands into spin crossover active metal organic frameworks leads to void spaces reminiscent of the &#8216;little blue box&#8217;. The inclusion of a &#960;&#8208;electron rich aromatic guest molecule causes a single crystal to single crystal transformation and guest&#8208;induced spin transition. Therefore, this work inspires the spin state control of these systems through the application of (photo&#8208;)electrical stimuli.







Abstract
Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.

         <title>Reversible Local Protonation&#8208;Deprotonation: Tuning Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Zinc Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnX4 and monoprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnX4 (X=Cl, Br) were constructed from a single chiral organic cation. The reversible structural transformation induced by polar solvents and HBr/heat engenders chiroptical switching behaviors. The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure&#8208;property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion&#8208;related chirality transfer.







Abstract
Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H16N2)ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnBr4) and monoprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H15N2)2ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnBr4), derived from the chiral organic amine (R/S)&#8208;2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine ((R/S)&#8208;C12H14N2). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero&#8208;dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo&#8208;layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure-property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion-related chirality transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli-responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;)-C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-LH2)ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and monoprotonated ((&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;)-C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-LH1)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), derived from the chiral organic amine (&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;)-2,3,4,9-Tetrahydro-1H-carbazol-3-amine ((&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;)-C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero-dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo-layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation-deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation-deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli-responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti-counterfeiting, and information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.







Abstract
Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3D printed propellant formulation was also tested.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion P and cation Mo co&#8208;doped MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi&#8208;directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li2S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO2. Furthermore, this well&#8208;designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P&#8208;doping expedites rapid Li2S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction&#8208;free energy, while Mo&#8208;doping facilitates robust Li2S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers. This dual&#8208;doping approach equips P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 with robust bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8722;S batteries incorporating P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based separators demonstrate favorable performance than pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi&#8208;directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Radical Isomerization Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Access C5, C6 or C7 Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical isomerization homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been successfully developed. Utilizing various monomers, the radical translocation pathway involving cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer occurs with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. These distinct propagation mechanisms enable C5, C6, or C7 polymerizations with precise control over monomer composition and main chain sequence.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated linear &#945;&#8208;olefins are valuable building blocks for organic transformation or olefin (co)polymerization, but they are recognized as textbook knowledge for non&#8208;homopolymerizable monomers under radical conditions. In this article, we disclose our effort to achieve an unprecedented library of all carbon&#8208;bonded sequence&#8208;regulated polymers via radical isomerization homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefin derivatives. The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>

         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C2H2 binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2 mixture.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.

Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF-TDCPB can not only obtain high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture, with the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&amp;gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF-TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high-humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Computation&#8208;Guided Design of Highly Defined and Dense Bimetallic Active Sites on a Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
This paper designs a substrate&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional conducting metal&#8211;organic framework with high density of active sites (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)) as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. This strategy provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites. Moreover, thermodynamics and kinetics are combined to explain the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental conclusions, which provides a referable direction for further computationally guided experiments.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of CoN4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90&#8201;%/85&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8211;0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative B&#8592;N bonds simultaneously integrate solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect and visible light reactivity into a crystalline supramolecular host. Alkenes organized by B&#8592;N bonds enable rapid guest release within the host upon visible light exposure in air through [2+2] photocycloaddition. Benefiting from the reversible structural transformation between B&#8592;N host and adduct cocrystal, a customized capture and release of guests is realized.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447&#8197;nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu&#8208;Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of NiIII&#8722;OOH and CoIII&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH3 and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long&#8208;term stability for up to 144&#8197;h. This work lays out new guidelines and reliable strategies from catalyst design to system coupling for biomass&#8208;derived electrochemical refinery.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral homopropargylic alcohols affords cyclopentenes with a quaternary chiral center. A chiral binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl phosphine ligand featuring a distal phosphoryl group enables gold&#8208;ligand cooperation in this highly enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cyclization chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.

In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; two-point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H-bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold-alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold-catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient method for the C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines was developed using readily available sulfinates and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This photoinduced radical approach enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane, providing access to a wide variety of fluoroalkylated pyridines.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, challenges are often faced with conventional Minisci reactions in achieving precise regioselectivity owing to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis of zinc cyclopropoxide enables a stereoselective hydroxyallylation of cyclopropenes with enolized homoenolate as a transient prochiral nucleophile, thus affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. An enantioselective variant has also been achieved using a chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC.







Abstract
A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;focus computationally guided iterative mutagenesis workflow was developed to simultaneously improve stability and activity in methyl parathion hydrolase. Thus, this study details a strategic innovation to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in protein engineering and can guide future efforts to design stable, highly active enzymes with defined structure&#8208;function relationships.







Abstract
Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme, methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23&#8197;candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm and 4.2&#8197;times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored molecular trap with optimal oxygen sites distribution is fabricated for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene isomers. Based on the specific molecular length recognition, simultaneous ultra&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) are achieved in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption.







Abstract
Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8211;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8722;C4H2O&#8722;CO2], featuring an effective pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>A Photocrosslinking Probe to Capture the Substrates of Caseinolytic Protease P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy using trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) and capture substrates within the barrel via a photocrosslinking moiety upon UV irradiation. The probes retain protease activity and capture numerous known and novel substrates of ClpP, allowing the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.







Abstract
Protein homeostasis in bacteria is regulated by proteases such as the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Although substrates of ClpP have been successfully deciphered in genetically engineered cells, methods which directly trap processed proteins within native cells remain elusive. Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy which utilizes trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of ClpP and capture adjacent substrates with an attached photocrosslinking moiety. After enrichment using an alkyne handle, substrate deconvolution by mass spectrometry (MS) is performed. We show that our two traps bind substoichiometrically to ClpP, retain protease activity, exhibit unprecedented selectivity for Staphylococcus aureus ClpP in living cells and capture numerous known and novel substrates. The exemplary validation of trapped hits using a targeted proteomics approach confirmed the fidelity of this technology. In conclusion, we provide a novel chemical platform suited for the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Chemistry in Aqueous Ammonium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency.

     alt="Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a high-precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV-1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV-1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS-SH) and polysulfide (RS-S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion-localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV-1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV-1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV-1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectrometry evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n=4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.

         <title>Novel Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Interactions in Polymer&#8208;Derived Sodium&#8208;Doped Amorphous Si&#8722;B&#8722;N Ceramic: Towards Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

Small Fish, big moves: In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non-emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>

         <dc:description>
Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion.

     alt="Palladium-Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non-Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilization of non-covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid-base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pd-catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non-covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non-covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non-covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>

         <dc:description>
Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.
