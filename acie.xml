         <title>Transesterification Induced Multifunctional Additives Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H2O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li+. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic&#8208;rich layer (e.g. Li3N/Li3P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high&#8208;performance electrolyte for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Compatible Gel&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by NaF&#8208;Solubility&#8208;Regulation toward All&#8208;Climate Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a pragmatic choice for high&#8208;safety sodium batteries but still plagued by interfacial compatibility with both cathode and anode simultaneously. Here, salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer fibers with NaF salt inlaid in polylactide (PLA) fiber network was fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent in&#8208;situ forming gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte in liquid electrolytes. The obtained PLA&#8208;NaF GPE achieves a high ion conductivity (2.50 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and large Na+ transference number (0.75) at ambient temperature. Notably, the dissolution of NaF salt occupies solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment, which facilitates aggregates with increased anionic coordination (anion/Na+&gt;1). Aggregates with higher HOMO realizes the preferential oxidation on the cathode so that inorganic&#8208;rich and stable CEI covers cathode&#8217; surface, preventing particles&#8217; breakage and showing good compatibility with different cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2+2xFe2&#8208;x(SO4)3, Na0.72Ni0.32Mn0.68O2, NaTi2(PO4)3). While, passivated Na anode induced by the lower LUMO of aggregates, and the lower surface tension between Na anode and PLA&#8208;NaF GPE interface, leading to the dendrites&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the assembled Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclopropenimine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Activation for the Synthesis of Polyurethanes and Small&#8208;Molecule Carbonates and Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Given the adverse impact of CO2 on the atmosphere, it is of paramount importance to devise strategies for upcycling it into useful materials, such as polymers and fine chemicals. To activate such stable molecule, superbases offer viable modes of binding to CO2. In this study, a superbase cyclopropenimine derivative was found to exhibit exceptional proficiency in activating CO2 and mediating its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. The versatility of this reaction can be extended to monofunctional amines and alcohols, yielding a variety of functional carbonates and carbamates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Thioesterase Involved in Dimerizationduring Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cinnamoyl lipid compound youssoufene A1 (1), featuring a unique dearomatic carbon&#8208;bridged dimeric skeleton, exhibits increased inhibition against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis compared to monomeric youssoufenes. However, the formation process of this intriguing dearomatic dimerization remains unknown. In this work, an unusual&#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221;thioesterase (TE) gene ysfF was functionally characterized. The gene was found to naturally encodes two proteins, an entire YsfF with&#160;&#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase&#160;and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase (4&#8208;HBT)&#8208;like enzyme&#160;domains, and a nested YsfFHBT (4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme). Using intracellular tagged carrier&#8208;protein tracking (ITCT) strategy, in vitro reconstitution and in vivo experiments, we found that: i) both domains of YsfF displayed thioesterase activities; ii) YsfF/YsfFHBT could accomplish the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure for benzene ring formation; and iii)&#160;YsfF and cyclase YsfX together were responsible&#160;for the ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatic dimerization process, possibly via an unprecedent Michael&#8208;type addition reaction. Moreover, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that N301, E483 and H566 of YsfF are critical residues for both the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and dimerization processes. This study&#160;enhances our understanding of&#160;the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Curvature Induction in an Artificial Bilayer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maintaining lipid asymmetry across membrane leaflets is critical for functions like vesicular traffic and organelle homeostasis. However, a lack of molecular&#8208;level understanding of the mechanisms underlying membrane fission and fusion processes in synthetic systems precludes their development as artificial analogs. Here, we report asymmetry induction of a bilayer membrane formed by an extended p&#8208;conjugated molecule with oxyalkylene side chains bearing terminal tertiary amine moieties (BA1) in water. Autogenous protonation of the tertiary amines in the periphery of the bilayer by water induces anisotropic curvature, resulting in membrane fission to form vesicles and can be monitored using time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy and microscopy. Interestingly, upon loss of the induced asymmetry by extensive protonation using an organic acid restored bilayer membrane. The mechanism leading to the compositional asymmetry in the leaflet and curvature induction in membrane is validated by DFT calculations. Studies extended to control molecules having changes in hydrophilic (BA2) and hydrophobic (BA3) segments provide insight into the delicate nature of molecular scale interactions in the dynamic transformation of supramolecular structures. The synergic effect of hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of BA1 aggregates provide dynamicity and unusual stability. Our study unveils mechanistic insight into the dynamic transformation of bilayer membranes into vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Amination of Isochromans and Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular structure&#8208;editing through selective C&#8208;C bond cleavage allows for the precise modification of molecular structures and opens up new possibilities in chemical synthesis. By strategically cleaving C&#8208;C bonds and editing the molecular structure, more efficient and versatile pathways for the synthesis of complex compounds could be designed, which brings significant implications for drug development and materials science. o&#8208;Aminophenethyl alcohols and amines are the essential key motifs in bioactive and functional material molecules. The traditional synthesis of these compounds usually requires multiple steps which could generate inseparable isomers and induce low efficiencies. By leveraging a molecular editing strategy, we herein reported a selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines for the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;aminophenethyl alcohols and amines. This innovative chemistry allows for the precise cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds under mild transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, further synthetic application demonstrated that our method could provide an efficient approach to essential components of diverse bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

By leveraging a molecular editing strategy, we herein reported a selective ring-opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines for the efficient synthesis of o-aminophenethyl alcohols and amines. This innovative chemistry allows for the precise cleavage of C-C bonds under mild transition metal-free conditions. Notably, further synthetic application demonstrated that our method could provide an efficient approach to essential components of diverse bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Asymmetric Backbone for Highly Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.7% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), PEDOT:PSS, is the most widely used material in the realization of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the stability of PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based OSCs is quite poor, arising from its strong acidity and hygroscopicity. In addition, PEDOT:PSS has an absorption in the infrared region region and high HOMO energy level, thus limiting the enhancement of short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), respectively. Herein, two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs), namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTMs in binary OSCs based on the well&#8208;known system of PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8&#8208;BO, and D18:eC9. Compared with BrCz, BrBACz shows larger dipole moment, deeper work function and lower surface energy. Moreover, BrBACz not only enhances photon harvesting in the active layer, but also minimizes voltage losses, thus improving interface charge extraction/ transport. Consequently, the PM6:eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz as HTM exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.70 % with a remarkable JSC of 29.20 mA cm&#8208;2 and a VOC of 0.856 V, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs so far. In addition, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0 % of its original efficiency after 1,000 hours of storage at ambient condition, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Appending Coronene Diimide with Carbon Nanohoops Allows for Rapid Intersystem Crossing in Neat Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative triplet materials plays a significant role in various applications. Although effective tuning of triplet formation by intersystem crossing (ISC) has been well established in solution, the modulation of ISC processes in the solid state remains a challenge due to the presence of other exciton decay channels through intermolecular interactions. The cyclic structure of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) offers a unique platform to tune the intermolecular packing, which leads to controllable exciton dynamics in the solid state. Herein, by integrating an electron deficient coronene diimide (CDI) unit into the CPP framework, a donor&#8722;acceptor type of conjugated macrocycle (CDI&#8722;CPP) featuring intramolecular charge&#8722;transfer (CT) interaction was designed and synthesized. Effective intermolecular CT interaction resulting from a slipped herringbone packing was confirmed by X&#8722;ray crystallography. Transient spectroscopy studies showed that CDI&#8722;CPP undergoes ISC in both solution and the film state, with triplet generation time constants of 4.5 ns and 238 ps, respectively. The rapid triplet formation through ISC in the film state can be ascribed to the cooperation between intra&#8722; and intermolecular charge&#8722;transfer interactions. Our results highlight that intermolecular CT interaction has a pronounced effect on the ISC process in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Genes For Dynamic Regulation Of DNA&#8208;Based Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a strategy to control dynamically the loading and release of molecular ligands from synthetic nucleic acid receptors using in vitro transcription. We demonstrate this by engineering three model synthetic DNA&#8208;based receptors: a triplex&#8208;forming DNA complex, an ATP&#8208;binding aptamer, and a hairpin strand, whose ability to bind their specific ligands can be cotranscriptionally regulated (activated or inhibited) through specific RNA molecules produced by rationally designed synthetic genes. The kinetics of our DNA sensors and their genetically generated inputs can be captured using differential equation models, corroborating the predictability of the approach used. This approach shows that highly programmable nucleic acid receptors can be controlled with molecular instructions provided by dynamic transcriptional systems, illustrating their promise in the context of coupling DNA nanotechnology with biological signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Supramolecular Polymers for Recyclable Photobiocatalytic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying enzymes with supramolecular polymers created SupEnzyme, endowing them with supramolecular functions and responsiveness to guest polymers. This approach significantly enhances enzyme recycling and offers advantages for photobiocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies. In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase&#8197;B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates through supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80&#8201;% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.

         <title>Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Synthesis of Propargyl&#8208; and Allenylsilanes through Catalytic Propargylic C&#8722;H Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular propargylic C&#8722;H silylation mediated by an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir complex. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric, synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity.







Abstract
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric and synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity. In the case of unsymmetrical dialkyl acetylenes, good to excellent selectivity for functionalization at the less&#8208;hindered site was also observed. A variety of electrophilic silyl sources (R3SiOTf and R3SiNTf2), either commercial or in situ&#8208;generated, were used as the silylation reagents, and a broad range of simple and functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkyl acetylenes, dialkyl acetylenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and drug derivatives were successfully employed as substrates. Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;&#8208;complexation&#8208;assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer&#8208;sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Electrokinetic Analyses Uncover the Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Biomass&#8208;Derived Monosaccharide Electroreduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical DHA conversion undergoes an initial dehydration and the subsequent hydrogenation to the acetol product. The electrokinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;determining step follows an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism, that is, increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone will promote the activity. At alkaline (local) pH, DHA conversion is a homogeneous chemical reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical biomass conversion holds promise to upcycle carbon sources and produce valuable products while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical DHA conversion undergoes an initial dehydration and the subsequent hydrogenation to the acetol product. The electrokinetic analysis reveals that the rate-determining step follows an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism, that is, increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone will promote the activity. At alkaline (local) pH, DHA conversion is a homogeneous chemical reaction.

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Disila&#8208;carbocycles via Highly Selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the intermolecular &#963;&#8208;bond exchange reaction of two different C&#8722;Si bonds with high cross&#8208;redistribution selectivity, which serves as a ring expansion protocol to assemble diverse disila&#8208;carbocycles. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the presence of hydrogen on silicon of silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain for both of two substrates are critical to ensure the desired reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully inhibited the preferential homodimerization and C&#8722;Si/Si&#8722;H bond cross&#8208;exchange of benzosilacyclobutenes and monohydro&#8208;silacyclobutanes and achieved the first highly selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction by deliberately tuning the Ni&#8208;catalytic system, which constitutes a powerful and atom&#8208;economical ring expansion method for preparing medium&#8208;sized cyclic compounds bearing two silicon atoms at the ring junction, which are otherwise inaccessible. The DFT calculation explicitly elucidated the pivotal role of Si&#8722;H bond at silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain of two substrates in realizing the two C&#8722;Si bonds cleavage and reformation in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a surface&#8208;lattice&#8208;doping (SLD) strategy for the stabilization of the solid electrolyte/cathode interface for its working at a high voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. Specifically, a uniform AlPO4 coating layer was built with nanometer precision around the LiCoO2 (LCO) particle. The following sintering at high temperature induced a homogeneous Al3+ diffusion into the LCO crust, leading to a controlled degree of surface Al/Co/Li disorder together with the formed Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 islands decorating the LCO surface. We found that this SLD strategy is capable of not only suppressing the structural degradation of LCO itself, but also effectively mitigating the decomposition of the chloride&#8208;based solid electrolyte at the interface, thereby ensuring the assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a LiCoO2 cathode excellent cycling stability at 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8211;solid&#8211;state Li&#8211;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8211;doped, cation&#8211;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8211;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8211;salt&#8211;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5&#8197;V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8211;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5&#8197;V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8211;based ASSBs at high voltages.

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Language of the Immunomodulatory Properties of Veillonella parvula Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut microbes might tip the delicate balance towards tolerance or inflammation. By analyzing the chemistry of LPS from two strains of the pathobiont Veillonella parvula, key and unprecedented structural differences were uncovered, which were reflected in diverse immunoactivities. Attempts were made to identify the molecular determinants governing this phenomenon.







Abstract
Veillonella parvula, prototypical member of the oral and gut microbiota, is at times commensal yet also potentially pathogenic. The definition of the molecular basis tailoring this contrasting behavior is key for broadening our understanding of the microbiota&#8208;driven pathogenic and/or tolerogenic mechanisms that take place within our body. In this study, we focused on the chemistry of the main constituent of the outer membrane of V. parvula, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS molecules indeed elicit pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses depending on their chemical structures. Herein we report the structural elucidation of the LPS from two strains of V. parvula and show important and unprecedented differences in both the lipid and carbohydrate moieties, including the identification of a novel galactofuranose and mannitol&#8208;containing O&#8208;antigen repeating unit for one of the two strains. Furthermore, by harnessing computational studies, in vitro human cell models, as well as lectin binding solid&#8208;phase assays, we discovered that the two chemically diverse LPS immunologically behave differently and have attempted to identify the molecular determinant(s) governing this phenomenon. Whereas pro&#8208;inflammatory potential has been evidenced for the lipid A moiety, by contrast a plausible &#8220;immune modulating&#8221; action has been proposed for the peculiar O&#8208;antigen portion.

Abstract
We report the triply selective and sequential diversification of a single Csp3 carbon carrying Cl, Bpin and GeEt3 for the modular and programmable construction of sp3&#8208;rich molecules. Various functionalizations of Csp3&#8722;Cl and Csp3&#8722;BPin (e.g. alkylation, arylation, homologation, amination, hydroxylation) were tolerated by the Csp3&#8722;GeEt3 group. Moreover, the methodological repertoire of alkyl germane functionalization was significantly expanded beyond the hitherto known Giese addition and arylation to alkynylation, alkenylation, cyanation, halogenation, azidation, C&#8722;S bond formation as well as the first demonstration of stereo&#8208;selective functionalization of a Csp3&#8208;[Ge] bond.

         <title>Phosphate Coordination to Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Secondary Building Units Prolongs Drug Retention for Synergistic Chemoradiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) to a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) prolongs its intratumoral retention and allows its continuous release for effective localized chemotherapy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) significantly outperforms free GMP and provides synergistic, potent chemoradiotherapy without causing side effects.







Abstract
Chemoradiotherapy combines radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy to potentiate antitumor activity but exacerbates toxicities and causes debilitating side effects in cancer patients. Herein, we report the use of a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) as a 2D nanoradiosensitizer and a reservoir for the slow release of chemotherapeutics to amplify the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Coordination of phosphate&#8208;containing drugs to MOL secondary building units prolongs their intratumoral retention, allowing for continuous release of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) for effective localized chemotherapy. In the meantime, the MOL sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray irradiation and provides potent radiotherapeutic effects. GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) enhances cytotoxicity by 2&#8208;fold and improves radiotherapeutic effects over free GMP in vitro. In a colon cancer model, GMP/MOL retains GMP in tumors for more than four days and, when combined with low&#8208;dose radiotherapy, inhibits tumor growth by 98&#8201;%. The synergistic chemoradiotherapy enabled by GMP/MOL shows a cure rate of 50&#8201;%, improves survival, and ameliorates cancer&#8208;proliferation histological biomarkers.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening of 1H&#8208;Benzo[4,5]oxazolopyridinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective and stereoselective C&#8722;O activation was achieved for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;arylisoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones. This method set up a new synthetic strategy for C&#8722;N atropisomer synthesis via an enantioselective ring&#8208;opening dynamic kinetic resolution process.







Abstract
The development of new methods for regio&#8208; and stereoselective activation of C&#8722;O bonds in ethers holds significant promise for synthetic chemistry, offering advantages in terms of environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. Moreover, the C&#8722;N atropisomers represent a fascinating and crucial chiral system, extensively found in natural products, pharmaceutical leads, and the frameworks of advanced materials. In this work, we have introduced a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective carbon&#8208;oxygen arylation reaction for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;arylisoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones. The high regioselectivity of C&#8722;O cleavage benefits from the high stability of the in&#8197;situ formed (amido)ethenolate via oxidative addition. Additionally, the self&#8208;activation of the aryl C&#8722;O bond facilitates the reaction under mild conditions, leading to outstanding enantioselectivities. The diverse post&#8208;functionalizations of the axially chiral isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones further highlighted the utility of this protocol in preparing valuable C&#8722;N atropisomers, including the chiral phosphine ligands.

         <title>Cover Picture: On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo, an ancient, plant&#8208;derived fabric dye, can be used to make Fe coordination polymers on silver surfaces as reported by Biao Yang, Joachim Reichert, Shobhana Narasimhan, Johannes&#8197;V. Barth, Anthoula&#8197;C. Papageorgiou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202319162). Within such coordination polymers on the close&#8208;packed silver surface, thermally activated switches from&#160;trans&#160;to&#160;cis&#160;indigo are triggered and result in isomeric indigo&#8208;Fe coordination polymers.

         <title>Topologically Tunable Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Modulating Conductivity and Chemiresistive Properties for NH3 Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are formed by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings into their frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The conductivity can be modulated by adjusting the solvent system, thus regulating the dimensions and topologies of the cMOFs. 1D Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 can be easily processed into thin membranes. The 2D kgm&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 has an excellent response toward NH3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems through ring&#8208;closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 102&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100&#8197;ppm NH3 at room temperature. This work not only provides valuable insights into the design of functional cMOFs with different topologies but also enriches the cMOF family with exceptional conductivity properties.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Integration of Phosphor, Initiator, and Crosslinker for the Photo&#8208;Polymerization of Flexible Phosphorescent Polymer Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general approach to constructing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials involves the incorporation of a phosphorescent emitter into a rigid host or polymers with high glass transition temperature. However, these materials often suffer from poor processability and suboptimal mechanical properties, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we developed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based dialkene (BTD&#8208;HEA), a multifunctional phosphorescent emitter with&#160;a remarkable yield of intersystem crossing (&#934;ISC, 99.83%). Its high triplet exciton generation ability and dialkene structure enable BTD&#8208;HEA to act as a photoinitiator and crosslinker, efficiently initiating the polymerization of various monomers within 120 seconds. A range of flexible phosphorescence gels, including hydrogels, organogels, ionogels, and aerogels were fabricated, which exhibit outstanding stretchability and recoverability.&#160;Furthermore, the unique fluorescent&#8208;phosphorescent colorimetric properties of the gels provide a more sensitive method for the visual determination of the polymerization process. Notably, the phosphorescent emission intensity of the hydrogel can be increased by the formation of ice, allowing for the precise detection of hydrogel freezing. The versatility of this emitter paves the way for fabricating various flexible phosphorescence gels with diverse morphologies using microfluidics, film&#8208;shearing, roll coating process, and two/three&#8208;dimensional printing, showcasing its potential applications in the fields of bioimaging and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Degradable Polymers from Tricycloalkenes via Complete Cascade Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade metathesis polymerization has been developed as a promising method to synthesize complex but well&#8208;defined polymers from monomers containing multiple reactive functional groups. However, this approach has been limited to the monomers involving simple alkene/alkyne moieties or produced mainly non&#8208;degradable polymers. In this study, we demonstrate a complete cascade ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization (RORCMP) using various tricycloalkenes and two strategies for the efficient degradation. Through rational design of tricycloalkene monomers, the structure and reactivity relationship was explored. For example, tricycloalkenes with trans configuration in the central ring enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP than the corresponding cis isomers. Also, a 4&#8208;substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170 kg/mol using an amide&#8208;containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one&#8208;shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Polymer Chiral Co&#8208;assembly and Contactless Dynamic Chiral Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays a pivotal role in cutting&#8208;edge display and information technologies. Currently achieving precise color control and dynamic signal regulation in CPL still remains challenging due to the elusory relationship between fluorescence and chirality. Inspired by the natural mechanisms governing color formation and chiral interaction, we proposed an addition&#8208;subtraction principle theory to address this issue. Three fluorene&#8208;based polymers synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation with different electron&#8208;deficient monomers exhibit similar structures and UV&#8208;vis absorption, but distinct fluorescence emissions due to intramolecular charge transfer. Based on this, precise&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active films are obtained through quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly directed by addition principle. Particularly, an ideal white&#8208;emitting CPL film (CIE coordinates: (0.33, 0.33)) is facilely fabricated with a high quantum yield of 80.8% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;2. Structural analysis reveals that the ordered stacking orientation favors higher glum. Furthermore, to address the dynamically regulated challenge, the comparable subtraction principle is proposed, involving a contactless chiral communication between excited and ground states. The representative system consisting of as&#8208;prepared fluorene&#8208;based polymers and chirality&#8208;selective absorption azobenzene (Azo)&#8208;containing polymers is constructed, achieving CPL weakening, reversal, and enhancement. Finally, a switchable quick response code is realized based on trans&#8208;cis isomerization of Azo moiety.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of lobatamides A (1a) and C (1c) via a common bislactone intermediate is reported. The allylic aryl moiety including a trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin is constructed by hydroboration of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allene and subsequent Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille coupling. Although the seco acid proved to be highly unstable even in the presence of weak bases, Zhao macrolactonization under acidic conditions via the a&#8208;acyloxyenamide successfully provided the common bislactone intermediate. Hydrozirconation&#8208;iodination of the terminal alkyne and subsequent copper&#8208;mediated coupling with primary amides successfully proceeded in the presence of the sensitive bislactone framework. The developed synthetic route enables the late&#8208;stage installation of enamide side chains, which are crucial structures for V&#8208;ATPase inhibitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic peptides: promising modalities for the targeting of disease related nucleic acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA and RNA play pivotal roles in life processes by storing and transferring genetic information, modulating gene expression, and contributing to essential cellular machinery such as ribosomes. Dysregulation and mutations in nucleic acid&#8208;related processes are implicated in numerous diseases. Despite the critical impact on health of nucleic acid mutations or dysregulation, therapeutic compounds addressing these biomolecules remain limited. Peptides have emerged as a promising class of molecules for biomedical research, offering potential solutions for challenging drug targets. This review focuses on the use of synthetic peptides to target disease&#8208;related nucleic acids. We discuss examples of peptides targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, including the clinical candidate Omomyc, and compounds designed for regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes. Further, we provide insights into both library&#8208;based screenings and the rational design of peptides to target regulatory human RNA scaffolds and viral RNAs, emphasizing the potential of peptides in addressing nucleic acid&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of DAT2, an Antigenic Glycolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DAT2 is a member of the diacyl trehalose family (DAT) of antigenic glycolipids located in the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recently it was shown that the molecular structure of DAT2 had been incorrectly assigned, but the correct structure remained elusive. Herein, the correct molecular structure of DAT2 and its methyl&#8208;branched acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid is determined. For this, four different stereo&#8208;isomers of mycolipanolic acid were prepared in a stereoselective and unified manner, and incorporated into DAT2. Rigorous comparison of the four isomers to the DAT isolated from Mtb H37Rv by NMR, HPLC, GC and mass spectrometry allowed a structural revision of mycolipanolic acid and DAT2. Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four isomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.</dc:description>

Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+-dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four isomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Mysteries: Acetonitrile&#8217;s Dance with Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes in Shaping Gas Evolution and Electrochemical Performance of Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal battery (AZMB) is a promising candidate for future large&#8208;scale energy storage with commendable capacity, exceptional safety characteristics, and low cost. Acetonitrile (AN) has been widely used as an effective electrolyte contituent to improve AZMBs&#8217; performance. However, its functioning mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we unveiled the critical roles of AN in AZMBs via comparative in&#8208;situ electrochemical, gaseous, and morphological analyses. Despite its limited ability to solvate Zn ions, AN modulated Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheath with increased anions and decreased water, achieving a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte. As a result, the Zn||Zn cell with AN addition exhibited a 63 times longer cycle life than cell without AN and achieved a 4 Ah cm&#8208;2 accumulated capacity with no H2 generation. In V2O5||Zn cells, for the first time, AN suppressing CO2 generation, elevating CO2&#8208;starting voltage from 2&#8594;2.44 V (H2: 2.43&#8594;2.55 V) was discovered. AN&#8208;impeded transit and Zn&#8208;side deposition of dissolved vanadium ions, known as &#8220;crosstalk,&#8221; ameliorated inhomogeneous Zn deposition and dendritic Zn growth. At last, we demonstrated a AN&#8208;enabled high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity AZMB (3.3 mAh cm&#8208;2) using high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading V2O5 cathode (26 mg cm&#8208;2). This study shed light on strategy of constructing fast&#8208;desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high&#8208;voltage AZMB cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Viral Detection Using Electrochemical Kinetic Profiling of Aptamer&#8208;Antigen Recognition in Clinical Samples and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;precision viral detection at point of need with clinical samples plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the control of a global pandemic. However, the complexity of clinical samples that often contain very low viral concentrations makes it a huge challenge to develop simple diagnostic devices that do not require any sample processing and yet are capable of meeting performance metrics such as very high sensitivity and specificity. Herein we describe a new single&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step electrochemical method that uses real&#8208;time kinetic profiling of the interaction between a high&#8208;affinity aptamer and an antigen on a viral surface. This method generates many data points per sample, which when combined with machine learning, can deliver highly accurate test results in a short testing time. We demonstrate this concept using both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza A viruses as model viruses with specifically engineered high&#8208;affinity aptamers. Utilizing this technique to diagnose COVID&#8208;19 with 37 real human saliva samples results in a sensitivity and specificity of both 100% (27 true negatives and 10 true positives, with 0 false negative and 0 false positive), which showcases the superb diagnostic precision of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Dual Defects of Bridging Organic and Terminal Inorganic Ligands in Iron&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nodes for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering advantageous defects to construct well&#8208;defined active sites in catalysts is promising but challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O due to the chemical inertness of N2 molecule. Here, we report defective Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalysts via a non&#8208;thermal plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where their NH3 production capability is synergistically regulated by two types of defects, namely, bridging organic ligands and terminal inorganic ligands (OH&#8722; and H2O). Specially, the optimized MIL&#8208;100(Fe) catalysts, where there are only terminal inorganic ligand defects and coexistence of dual defects, exhibit the respective 1.7&#8208; and 7.7&#8208;fold activity enhancement comparable to the pristine catalyst under visible light irradiation. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the dual defects in the catalyst induce the formation of abundant and highly accessible coordinatively unsaturated Fe active sites and synergistically optimize their geometric and electronic structures, which favors the injection of more d&#8208;orbital electrons in Fe sites into the N2 &#960;* antibonding orbital to achieve N2 activation and the formation of a key intermediate *NNH in the reaction. This work provides a guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of porous catalysts with precise defective structures for high&#8208;performance activation of catalytic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enzymatic Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage and Aldol Reaction Cascade Converts an Angular Scaffold into the Linear Tetracyclic Core of Ochraceopones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Meroterpenoids of the ochraceopones family featuring a linear tetracyclic scaffold exhibit exceptional antiviral and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. The biosynthetic pathway and chemical logic to generate this linear tetracycle, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized all biosynthetic enzymes to afford ochraceopones and elucidated the complete biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrated that the linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones was derived from an angular tetracyclic precursor. A multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH was validated to catalyze the free radical&#8208;initiated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage of the angular tetracycle. Then, a new carbon&#8208;carbon bond was verified to be constructed using a new aldolase OchL, which catalyzes intramolecular an aldol reaction to form the linear tetracycle. This carbon&#8208;carbon bond fragmentation and aldol reaction cascade features an unprecedented strategy for converting a common angular tetracycle to a distinctive linear tetracyclic scaffold in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Lowering Entropic Barriers in Triplex DNA Switches Facilitating Biomedical Applications at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplex DNA switches are attractive allosteric tools for engineering smart nanodevices, but their poor triplex&#8208;forming capacity at physiological conditions limited the practical applications. To address this challenge, we proposed a low&#8208;entropy barrier design to facilitate triplex formation by introducing a hairpin duplex linker into the triplex motif, and the resulting triplex switch was termed as CTNSds. Compared to the conventional clamp&#8208;like triplex switch, CTNSds&#160;increased the triplex&#8208;forming ratio from 30% to 91% at pH 7.4 and stabilized the triple&#8208;helix structure in FBS and cell lysate. CTNSds&#160;was also less sensitive to free&#8208;energy disturbances, such as lengthening linkers or mismatches in the triple&#8208;helix stem. The CTNSds&#160;design was utilized to reversibly isolate CTCs from whole blood, achieving high capture efficiencies (&gt;86%) at pH 7.4 and release efficiencies (&gt;80%) at pH 8.0. Our approach broadens the potential applications of DNA switches&#8208;based switchable nanodevices, showing great promise in biosensing and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Low Crystallinity for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low molecular packing order are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. On the other hand, n&#8208;doped CPs usually exhibit inferior thermoelectric performance, restricting the development of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n&#8208;type CP (ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz) by alternating two acceptor units of thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and cyano&#8208;functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz shows a low&#8208;lying LUMO level below &#8208;4.20 eV and features low crystallinity, enabling the attainment of high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual&#8208;acceptor molecular design enhances polaron delocalization, thereby improving the thermoelectric performance of the polymer. After n&#8208;doping, ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits an electrical conductivity (s) of 50.6 S cm&#8208;1 and a power factor (PF) of 126.8 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2, which ranks among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type CPs to date. Additionally, solution&#8208;processed flexible OTE device employing doped ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz achieves a PF of 70 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low molecular packing order are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. On the other hand, n-doped CPs usually exhibit inferior thermoelectric performance, restricting the development of high-performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n-type CP (ThDPP-CNBTz) by alternating two acceptor units of thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and cyano-functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP-CNBTz shows a low-lying LUMO level below -4.20 eV and features low crystallinity, enabling the attainment of high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual-acceptor molecular design enhances polaron delocalization, thereby improving the thermoelectric performance of the polymer. After n-doping, ThDPP-CNBTz exhibits an electrical conductivity (s) of 50.6 S cm-1 and a power factor (PF) of 126.8 &#956;W m-1 K-2, which ranks among the highest reported for solution-processed n-type CPs to date. Additionally, solution-processed flexible OTE device employing doped ThDPP-CNBTz achieves a PF of 70 &#956;W m-1 K-2. Meanwhile, the flexible OTE devices present remarkable resistance to bending strain, with marginal change in &#963; after 600 bending cycles. The findings presented in this work will advance the development of n-type CPs for OTE devices, with a particular focus on flexible properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Lateral Adsorbate Interaction for Efficient Electroreforming of Bio&#8208;polyols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the selectivity at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is one of the greatest challenges for heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and complementary strategies to catalyst structural designs need to be developed. Herein, we proposed a new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways by lateral adsorbate interaction for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion possesses the alcoholic property that facilely adsorbs on the nickel oxyhydroxide catalyst, but is resistant to oxidation due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups.&#160;The alien HFIP adsorbents can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which achieved a &gt;2&#8208;fold enhancement of the oxalate selectivity to 55% for the representative glycerol oxidation and can be extended to various bio&#8208;polyol substrates.&#160;Through in&#8208;situ spectroscopic analysis and DFT calculation on the glycerol oxidation, we reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded adsorbate reaction can effectively tune the adsorption energies and tailor the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products. This work offers an additional perspective of tuning electrocatalytic reactions via introducing redox&#8208;innocent adsorbates to create lateral adsorbate interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Phenoxazine's Unique Reversible Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process and Stable Redox Intermediates for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low specific capacity determined by the limited electron transfer of p&#8208;type cathode materials is the main obstruction to their application towards high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). To overcome this challenge,  boosting multi&#8208;electron transfer is essential for improving the charge storage capacity. Here, as a typical heteroaromatic p&#8208;type material, we unveil the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox properties of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolyte for the first time. The second oxidation process is stabilized in the aqueous electrolyte, a notable contrast to its less reversibility in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. A comprehensive investigation of the redox chemistry mechanism demonstrates remarkably stable redox intermediates, including a stable cation radical PNO&#8226;+ characterized by effective electron delocalization and a closed&#8208;shell state dication PNO2+. Meanwhile, the heightened aromaticity contributes to superior structural stability during the redox process, distinguishing it from phenazine, which features a non&#8208;equivalent hybridized sp2&#8208;N motif. Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the PNO electrodes deliver a high capacity of 215 mAh g&#8208;1 compared to other p&#8208;type materials, and impressive long cycling stability with 100 % capacity retention over 3500 cycles. This work marks a crucial step forward in advanced organic electrodes based on multi&#8208;electron transfer phenoxazine moieties for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) reveals larger molecule number and slower dynamics of vesicles opening after vesicles are treated with stress granules (SGs), implying homotypic fusion between vesicles, confirmed by observation of multi&#8208;core vesicles with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This finding provides new insights into how neural cells regulate exocytosis under oxidative stress and how SGs promote neurodegeneration.







Abstract
An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long&#8208;lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming that SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA or protein in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double&#8208;core vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes and opening a new direction to investigations of SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.

         <title>Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer the use of real&#8208;time electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrochemical processes at individual single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with single photon sensitivity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), distinguished by their maximum atom efficiency and precise control over the coordination and electronic properties of individual atoms, show great promise in electrocatalysis. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100&#8197;ms, enabling real&#8208;time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. The outcomes contribute to a fundamental understanding of SACs and pave the way for designing SACs with diverse technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Phase Identification and Discovery of an Elusive Polymorph of Drug&#8208;Polymer Inclusion Complex Using Automated 3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated low&#8208;dose 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) protocol was developed to identify and determine the structures of six phases of griseofulvin in a multiphasic melt&#8208;crystallisation product. 3D ED data were collected from over 230 individual nano&#8208;sized crystals and processed without supervision, enabling the discovery of a new griseofulvin polyethylene glycol inclusion complex. This study highlights 3D ED&#8242;s potential in drug development.







Abstract
3D electron diffraction (3D ED) has shown great potential in crystal structure determination in materials, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. In this work, an automated, low&#8208;dose and low&#8208;bias 3D ED protocol has been implemented to identify six phases from a multiple&#8208;phase melt&#8208;crystallisation product of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, griseofulvin (GSF). Batch data collection under low&#8208;dose conditions using a widely available commercial software was combined with automated data analysis to collect and process over 230 datasets in three days. Accurate unit cell parameters obtained from 3D ED data allowed direct phase identification of GSF Forms III, I and the known GSF inclusion complex (IC) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;I), as well as three minor phases, namely GSF Forms II, V and an elusive new phase, GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;II. Their structures were then directly determined by 3D ED. Furthermore, we reveal how the stabilities of the two GSF&#8208;PEG IC polymorphs are closely related to their crystal structures. These results demonstrate the power of automated 3D ED for accurate phase identification and direct structure determination of complex, beam&#8208;sensitive crystallisation products, which is significant for drug development where solid form screening is crucial for the overall efficacy of the drug product.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the interaction between H2O and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been first explored. The H2O molecular changes the electronic states of COFs and the possible catalytic center's locations. The COF based on the pyridine N linkers showed higher activity than those COFs based on other kinds of N atoms.







Abstract
Binding water molecules to polar sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is inevitable, but the corresponding solvent effects in electrocatalytic process have been largely overlooked. Herein, we investigate the solvent effects on COFs for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our designed COFs incorporated different kinds of nitrogen atoms (imine N, pyridine N, and phenazine N), enabling tunable interactions with water molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating electronic states and altering the catalytic centers within the COFs. Among the synthesized COFs, the one with pyridine N atoms exhibits the highest activity, with characterized by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78&#8197;V and a mass activity of 0.32&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which surpass those from other metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the stronger binding ability of *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridine N sites. This work sheds light on the significance of considering solvent effects on COFs in electrocatalytic systems, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization for improved performance.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Utilization of Latent Heat in Erythritol&#8208;based Phase Change Materials as Solar Thermal Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an erythritol&#8208;based phase change material as a new type of solar thermal fuels. The material can harvest, convert, and store solar energy as latent heat, which can be released as thermal energy on demand. The composite material is cost&#8208;effective, easy to synthesize, and has a superior solar thermal energy utilization performance. This new concept could promote related solar energy utilization techniques.







Abstract
Solar thermal fuels (STFs) have been particularly concerned as sustainable future energy due to their impressive ability to store solar energy in chemical bonds and controllably release thermal energy. However, currently studied STFs mainly focus on molecule&#8208;based materials with high photochemical activity, toxicity, and compromised features, which greatly restricts their applications in practical scenarios of solar energy utilization. Herein, we present a novel erythritol&#8208;based composite phase change material (PCM) as a new type of STFs with an outstanding capability to store solar energy as latent heat in its stable supercooling state and release thermal energy as needed. This composite PCM with stored thermal energy can be maintained stably at room temperature and subsequently release latent heat as high as 224.9&#8197;J/g during the crystallization process triggered by thermal stimuli. Remarkably, solar energy can be converted into latent heat stored in the composite PCM over months. Through mechanical stimulations, the released latent heat can increase the temperature of the composite up to 91&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a new concept of using spatiotemporal storage and release of latent heat in PCMs for solar energy utilization, making it a potential candidate as STFs for developing future clean energy techniques.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Two&#8208;Dimensional Defective Bi Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets were reconstructed in situ to defective Bi nanosheets, forming rich grain boundaries that were conducive to the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for CO2 and NO3&#8722; reduction to produce urea.







Abstract
Abstract:Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two&#8208;dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi2Se3 nanosheets under electrochemical CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets obtained by NaBH4&#8208;assisted cryo&#8208;mediated liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries (GBs; GB&#8208;rich Bi). The reconstructed GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 32&#8201;% for urea production at &#8722;0.40&#8197;V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2&#8197;times higher than those of the low&#8208;GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH2 intermediate formation energy and C&#8722;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure&#8208;activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.

         <title>Modulating Inorganic Dimensionality of Ultrastable Lead Halide Coordination Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a coordination chemistry strategy to modulate the 2D to 3D transformation of lead iodide sublattices in robust coordination polymers. The synthetic strategy enhances the charge&#8208;transport properties for efficient carrier accumulation and introduces asymmetric charge distribution for C&#8722;C coupling, leading to efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction to C2 products.







Abstract
Lead halide hybrids have shown great potentials in CO2 photoreduction, but challenging to afford C2+ reduced products, especially using H2O as the reductant. This is largely due to the trade&#8208;off problem between instability of the benchmark 3D structures and low carrier mobility of quasi&#8208;2D analogues. Herein, the lead halide dimensionality of robust coordination polymers (CP) was modulated by organic ligands differing in a single&#8208;atom change (NH vs. CH2), in which the NH groups coordinate with interlamellar [PbI2] clusters to achieve the important 2D&#8594;3D transition. This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25&#8197;meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C2H5OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI2] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.

This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25&#8197;meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm with a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orthogonal sp3&#8208;Ge/B Bimetallic Modules: Enantioselective Construction and Enantiospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of chiral sp3&#8208;Ge reagents for use in stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling represents a significant challenge. Herein, unprecedented enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were achieved through enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration, and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of secondary alkyl&#8208;Ge was realized in a stereospecific manner with Bpin perfectly preserved. The synthetic value of these modules highlighted the significance of Ge/B bimetallic orthogonal strategy.







Abstract
In this study, a series of enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were successfully synthesized via an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of carbagermatrane (Ge)&#8208;containing alkenes. Orthogonal cross&#8208;coupling selectivity under different Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions was achieved in an enantiospecific manner. Notably, the chiral secondary Ge exhibited a remarkable transmetallation ability prior to primary or secondary Bpin. The effectiveness of this Ge/B bimetallic strategy was further demonstrated through the development of new functional small molecules with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) performance. This represents the first successful example of synthesis of enantioenriched alkylgermanium reagents that permit enantiospecific cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Dimer Decay Responsible for Gem&#8208;Dicarbonyl Formation on a Model Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;lapse scanning tunneling microscopy movies are combined with theoretical computations to study CO adsorption on a model Rh1/Fe3O4(001) catalyst under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Direct CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results in monocarbonyl species. Rh1&#8722;(CO)2 gem dicarbonyl species are observed, but from only via the CO&#8208;induced break&#8208;up of Rh2 dimer species.







Abstract
The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide&#8208;spread applicability of single&#8208;atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single&#8208;crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh1 adatoms and minority Rh2 dimers on Fe3O4(001) during exposure to CO using time&#8208;lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results exclusively in stable Rh1CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo&#8208;square planar environment. Rh1(CO)2 gem&#8208;dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh2 dimers via an unstable Rh2(CO)3 intermediate. Overall, our results illustrate how minority species invisible to area&#8208;averaging spectra can play an important role in catalytic systems, and show that the decomposition of dimers or small clusters can be an avenue to produce reactive, metastable configurations in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Bifunctional Potential Structure Design Breaks Electrolyte Limitations of Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective molecular design strategy was proposed to provide a favorable reaction environment for high&#8208;capacity electrodes with a bifunctional potential region. The proton&#8208;doping chemistry of polyaniline resulted in localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, thus broadening the pH applicability of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are safe and economical for grid applications. However, current ZIBs have limitations in terms of inferior capacity and low output voltage, which are hampered by the electrolyte applicability of the Zn2+ hosts. In this study, we propose a novel organic cathode design strategy with a bifunctional potential region. This polymeric Zn2+ host combines the conjugated polyaniline backbone to tune the molecular surface pH and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; redox couple for high output voltage and capacity. The polyaniline doped with ferricyanide (PAF) electrode exhibits two forms of charge storage in ZIBs: proton&#8208;assisted Zn2+ doping below 1.2&#8197;V (mechanism I), and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; redox pair above 1.8&#8197;V (mechanism II). Density functional theory calculations and in situ pH experiments demonstrated that the H+ doping process of mechanism I forms a localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, providing a favorable reaction environment for mechanism II. The Zn&#8208;polymer battery delivered an outstanding discharge capacity (405.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high output voltage (1.8&#8197;V) in the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. This study provides a new route for enhancing the structural stability of electrodes and overcoming the electrolyte limitations of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Sodium Metal Battery Based on a NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 composite electrolyte, composed of the disordered NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3 and the ordered NaB3H8, was rapidly synthesized from the sticky NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH3 after the partial removal of NH3 at room temperature and successfully used at rates above 1&#8197;C in a solid&#8208;state sodium metal battery. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial stability for high&#8208;rate sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications owing to their intrinsic safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, they generally suffer from sodium dendrite growth or rapid capacity fading, especially at high rates, mainly due to poor wettability, sluggish ionic transport, or low interfacial stability of the solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a novel composite, NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 (x&lt;1), as a new class of solid electrolyte for high&#8208;rate batteries. NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 is obtained from the sticky NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH3 after removal of NH3 partially at room temperature. It delivers an ionic conductivity of 0.84&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and reaches 20.64&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 45&#8201;&#176;C after an order&#8208;disorder phase transformation. It also reveals a good capability of dendrite suppression and remarkable stability against sodium metal. These performances enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na//TiS2 battery with a high capacity of 232.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (97.2&#8201;% of theoretical capacity) and long&#8208;term cycling stability at 1&#8197;C. Notably, this battery shows superior long&#8208;life cycling stability even at 5 and 10&#8197;C, which has been rarely reported in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes, contributing to fast&#8208;charging or high&#8208;power&#8208;density sodium metal batteries.

NaB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@NaB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained from the sticky NaB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; after removal of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; partially at room temperature. It delivers an ionic conductivity of 0.84&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C and reaches 20.64&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 45&#8201;&#176;C after an order-disorder phase transformation. It also reveals a good capability of dendrite suppression and remarkable stability against sodium metal. These performances enable the all-solid-state Na//TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with a high capacity of 232.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (97.2&#8201;% of theoretical capacity) and long-term cycling stability at 1&#8197;C. Notably, this battery shows superior long-life cycling stability even at 5 and 10&#8197;C, which has been rarely reported in all-solid-state sodium metal batteries. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes, contributing to fast-charging or high-power-density sodium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Build a High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Introducing Competitive Coordination Induction Effect in Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. The intrinsic mechanism of CCIE and its effects on both the Li+ conductivity and the interfacial stability at RT were clarified. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability and cycling performance at 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li+ conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application. Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs+&#8230;TFSI&#8722;&#8230;Li+, Cs+&#8230;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8230;Li+ and 2,4,6&#8208;TFA&#8230;Li&#8230;TFSI&#8722;) from the competitive cation (Cs+ from CsPF6) and molecule (2,4,6&#8208;TFA: 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li+ is constructed enabling a high efficient Li+ migration at 30&#8201;&#176;C (Li+ conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1; tLi+=0.61). Since Cs+ tends to be enriched at the interface, TFSI&#8722; and PF6&#8722; in situ form LiF&#8208;Li3N&#8208;Li2O&#8208;Li2S enriched solid electrolyte interface with electrostatic shielding effects. The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO4: 147.44&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@1&#8197;C and 107.41mAhg&#8722;1@2&#8197;C) and cycling stability at 30&#8201;&#176;C (LiFePO4:94.65&#8201;%@200cycles@0.5&#8197;C; LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2: 94.31&#8201;%@200&#8197;cycles@0.3&#8197;C). This work proposes a concept of CCIE and reveals its mechanism in designing PICE with high ionic conductivity as well as high interfacial compatibility at near RT for high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light harvesting scaffold: Pd(II)/Pt(II)&#8208;based supramolecular scaffolds are well known for providing a wide pool of discrete architectures with numerous applications in catalysis, guest encapsulation, proton conductivity, explosive detection etc. This minireview summarizes various such light harvesting metallacycles, and metallacages that have opened up a new direction in terms of their structural design as well as exciting new applications.







Abstract
The development of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems mimicking the natural photosynthesis method is an ever&#8208;growing field of research. Numerous systems such as polymers, metal complexes, POFs, COFs, supramolecular frameworks etc. have been fabricated to accomplish more efficient energy transfer and storage. Among them, the supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) formed by non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;ligand interaction, have shown the capacity to not only undergo single and multistep energy migration but also to utilize the harvested energy for a wide variety of applications such as photocatalysis, tunable emissive systems, encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, white light emitters etc. This review sheds light on the light&#8208;harvesting behavior of both the 2D metallacycles and 3D metallacages where design ingenuity has been executed to afford energy harvesting by both donor ligands as well as metal acceptors.

A phenothiazine&#8208;based molecular hole&#8208;transporter (PTZ&#8722;CPA) carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group is developed for the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in the highest solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion efficiencies of 25.35&#8201;% under standard air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight.







Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted&#8208;structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film&#8208;forming on hydrophobic or defective hole&#8208;transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole&#8208;transporter, (2&#8208;(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ&#8722;CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ&#8722;CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole&#8208;selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective material (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8722;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8722;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four&#8208;fold) and Shockley&#8208;Read&#8208;Hall lifetime (eight&#8208;fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8722;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole&#8208;collection. Consequently, FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35&#8201;% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8722;CPA based device shows commendable long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Highly Selective and Efficient Perdeuteration of n&#8208;Pentane via H/D Exchange Catalyzed by a Silica&#8208;Supported Hafnium&#8208;Iridium Bimetallic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hafnium&#8208;iridium complex immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach is used to prepare a novel hafnium&#8208;iridium catalyst immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, featuring well&#8208;defined [&#8801;SiOHf(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;H)3IrCp*] surface sites. Unlike the monometallic analogous materials Hf/SiO2 and Ir/SiO2, which promote n&#8208;pentane deuterogenolysis through C&#8722;C bond scission, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (1&#8197;bar D2, 250&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8197;h, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the heterobimetallic catalyst HfIr/SiO2 is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis (&lt;2&#8201;% at 95&#8201;% conversion). Furthermore this HfIr/SiO2 catalyst is robust and can be re&#8208;used several times without evidence of decomposition. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Double 1,2&#8208;Carbon Migration at Mixed Heavier Sn=Ge Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene to the germastannenylidene. Theoretical studies reveal that the isomerization process involves stepwise carboranyl group and aryl group migration. The reactivity studies demonstrate that the stannagermenylidene undergoes intriguing electron redistribution to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct upon treatment with IMe4 and readily reacts with (AlCp*)4 to give the unique heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;migration is one recurring isomerization reaction in organic chemistry. In contrast, double 1,2&#8208;migration remains rare and limited to transition&#8208;metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of mixed heavier Sn=Ge vinylidenes. Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene (3) to the germastannenylidene (4). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations revealed that 3 and 4 feature a Sn=Ge double bond. The reaction of 3 with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) results in the electron redistribution in the Sn=Ge core to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct (5). Moreover, treatment of 3 with 0.25&#8197;equiv. of (AlCp*)4 produces the heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne (6).

         <title>Photoelectron Migration Boosted by Hollow Double&#8208;Shell Dyads Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow double&#8208;shell dyads have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and transition metal sulfides, the double&#8208;shell architecture broadens light absorption, improves hydrogen evolution kinetics and reduces the photogenerated electron transfer resistance, resulting in high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on noble metal&#8208;free systems is a promising technology for the conversion of solar energy into green hydrogen, it is pivotal and challenging to tailor&#8208;make photocatalysts for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported a hollow double&#8208;shell dyad through uniformly coating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the surface of hollow Co9S8. The double shell architecture enhances the scattering and refraction efficiency of incident light, shortens the transmission distance of the photogenerated charge carriers, and exposes more active sites for photocatalytic conversion. The hydrogen evolution rate is as high as 23.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is significantly enhanced when compared with that of their physical mixture (0.30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Pt&#8208;based counterpart (11.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work provides a rational approach to the construction of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems based on COFs to enhance hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the severe accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction on Cu, S&#8208;doped Cu nanorod arrays (Cu&#8722;S NAs) were designed via an electrochemical conversion strategy. The high FE of ammonia (98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (1.4&#8201;%) can be achieved on Cu&#8722;S NAs. The introduction of S can significantly decrease the energy barrier of H2O dissociation to *H, leading to a favorable hydrogenation of *NO2 and enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia selectivity.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu&#8208;based catalysts performs a leading&#8208;edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surface is difficult and insufficient, leading to the significant generation of by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. Herein, sulphur doped Cu (Cu&#8722;S) is prepared via an electrochemical conversion strategy and used for nitrate electroreduction. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia (~98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (~1.4&#8201;%) are achieved on Cu&#8722;S, obviously superior to its counterpart of Cu (FENH3: 70.4&#8201;%, FENO2&#8722;: 18.8&#8201;%). Electrochemical in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of S doping on Cu surface can promote the kinetics of H2O dissociation to active hydrogen. The optimized hydrogen affinity validly decreases the hydrogenation kinetic energy barrier of *NO2, leading to an enhanced NH3 selectivity.

         <title>Highly Conductive Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains as Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains efficiently dissociate Li salts and transport Li+ for the durable operation of Li metal full cells.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are often used for Li+ conduction as they can dissociate the Li salts efficiently. However, high entanglement of the chains and lack of pathways for rapid ion diffusion limit their applications in advanced batteries. Recent developments in ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) showed that their highly ordered structures provide efficient pathways for Li+ transport, solving the limitations of traditional PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Here, we present imidazolate COFs, PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, having methoxyethoxy chains, synthesized by Debus&#8211;Radziszewski multicomponent reactions and their ionized form, Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, showing a high Li+ conductivity of 8.81&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a transference number of 0.974. The mechanism for such excellent electrochemical properties is that methoxyethoxy chains dissociate LiClO4, making free Li+, then those Li+ are transported through the imidazolate COFs&#8217; pores. The synthesized Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs formed a stable interface with Li metal. Thus, employing Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs as the solid electrolyte to assemble LiFePO4 batteries showed an initial discharge capacity of 119.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C, and 82.0&#8201;% capacity and 99.9&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency were maintained after 400&#8197;cycles.

     alt="Highly Conductive Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains as Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains efficiently dissociate Li salts and transport Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for the durable operation of Li metal full cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based electrolytes are often used for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction as they can dissociate the Li salts efficiently. However, high entanglement of the chains and lack of pathways for rapid ion diffusion limit their applications in advanced batteries. Recent developments in ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) showed that their highly ordered structures provide efficient pathways for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, solving the limitations of traditional PEO-based electrolytes. Here, we present imidazolate COFs, PI-TMEFB-COFs, having methoxyethoxy chains, synthesized by Debus&#8211;Radziszewski multicomponent reactions and their ionized form, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;@PI-TMEFB-COFs, showing a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 8.81&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a transference number of 0.974. The mechanism for such excellent electrochemical properties is that methoxyethoxy chains dissociate LiClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, making free Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, then those Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are transported through the imidazolate COFs&#8217; pores. The synthesized Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;@PI-TMEFB-COFs formed a stable interface with Li metal. Thus, employing Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;@PI-TMEFB-COFs as the solid electrolyte to assemble LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; batteries showed an initial discharge capacity of 119.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;C, and 82.0&#8201;% capacity and 99.9&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency were maintained after 400&#8197;cycles. These results show that iCOFs with ether chains synthesized via multicomponent reactions can create a new chapter for making solid electrolytes for advanced rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discriminating the Active Ru Species Towards the Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen from Peroxymonosulfate: Nanoparticles Surpass Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the single&#8208;atom structure, ruthenium nanoparticles with adjacent surface sites exhibit enhanced activation of O&#8722;O bonds in peroxymonosulfate. This promoted activation facilitates the selective production of singlet oxygen, resulting in a high degradation efficiency for electron&#8208;rich pollutants.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an exceptional reactive oxygen species in advanced oxidation processes for environmental remediation. Despite single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) representing the promising candidate for the selective generation of 1O2 from peroxymonosulfate (PMS), the necessity to meticulously regulate the coordination environment of metal centers poses a significant challenge in the precisely&#8208;controlled synthetic method. Another dilemma to SACs is their high surface free energy, which results in an inherent tendency for the surface migration and aggregation of metal atoms. We here for the first time reported that Ru nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the facile pyrolysis method behave as robust Fenton&#8208;like catalysts, outperforming Ru SACs, towards efficient activation of PMS to produce 1O2 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity, remarkably improving the degradation efficiency for target pollutants. Density functional theory calculations have unveiled that the boosted PMS activation can be attributed to two aspects: (i) enhanced adsorption of PMS molecules onto Ru NPs, and (ii) decreased energy barriers by offering adjacent sites for promoted dimerization of *O intermediates into adsorbed 1O2. This study deepens the current understanding of PMS chemistry, and sheds light on the design and optimization of Fenton&#8208;like catalysts.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanoparticle to Co&#8208;Deliver Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Peptides and Pt(IV) Prodrug: Toward High Loading Efficiency and Combination Efficacy</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. Notably, the polymeric nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable combination efficacy on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model.







Abstract
Developing combination chemotherapy systems with high drug loading efficiency at predetermined drug ratios to achieve a synergistic effect is important for cancer therapy. Herein, a polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. The depolymerization of polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle and the activation of Pt prodrug can be effectively triggered by the acidic tumor environment extracellularly and the high levels of glutathione intracellularly in cancer cells, respectively. The utilization of mitochondria&#8208;targeting peptide can inhibit ATP&#8208;dependent processes including drug efflux and DNA damage repair. This leads to increased accumulation of Pt&#8208;drugs within cancer cells. Eventually, the polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable antitumor effects on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model. It is highly anticipated that the polymeric dual&#8208;or multi&#8208;drug systems can be applied for combination chemotherapy to achieve enhanced anticancer activity and reduced side effects.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor in Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Tuning Molecular Electrostatic Potential Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), significant progress has been made in tailoring molecular structures to enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage and the short&#8208;circuit current density. However, there remains a crucial gap in the development of coordinated material design strategies focused on improving the fill factor (FF). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that incorporates electrostatic potential fluctuation (ESPF) to design organic photovoltaic materials. By reducing the ESPF amplitude of IT&#8208;4F, we synthesized a new acceptor named ITOC6&#8208;4F. When using PBQx&#8208;TF as a donor, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell shows a markedly low recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8208;14 cm3 s&#8208;1 and demonstrates an outstanding FF of 0.816, both of which are new records for binary OPV cells. Also, we find that flat ESPF could decrease the energetic disorder of OPV cells, reducing energy loss. Finally, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell creates the highest efficiency of 16.0% among medium&#8208;gap OPV cells. Our work holds a vital implication for guiding the design of high&#8208;performance OPV materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Exfoliation of Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and CH4 Valorization Mediated by O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8208;decomposition (NID) strategy is developed to exfoliate bulk C3N4 (BCN) into oxygen&#8208;rich, porous, few&#8208;layered C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tunable thickness. The optimal fl&#8208;CN catalyst is effective not only in producing H2O2 by O2 reduction, but also in selective oxidation CH4 with O2 to C1 oxygenates with a record&#8208;high production rate of 1893&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work represents a significant advance in the synthesis and application of new C3N4&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The exfoliation of bulk C3N4 (BCN) into ultrathin layered structure is an effective strategy to boost photocatalytic efficiency by exposing interior active sites and accelerating charge separation and transportation. Herein, we report a novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8208;decomposition (NID) strategy that is effective in peeling off BCN into few&#8208;layer C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tailored thickness down to bi&#8208;layer. This strategy only involves hydrothermal treatment of BCN in diluted HNO3 aqueous solution, followed by pyrolysis at various temperatures. The decomposition of the nitrate anions not only exfoliates BCN and changes the band structure, but also incorporates oxygen species onto fl&#8208;CN, which is conducive to O2 adsorption and hence relevant chemical processes. In photocatalytic O2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the H2O2 production rate over the optimal fl&#8208;CN&#8208;530 catalyst is 952&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 8.8&#8197;times that over BCN. More importantly, under full arc irradiation and in the absence of hole scavenger, CH4 can be photocatalytically oxidized by on&#8208;site formed H2O2 and active oxygen species to generate value&#8208;added C1 oxygenates with high selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% and record&#8208;high production rate of 1893&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 among the metal&#8208;free C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Simplifying Access to Targeted Protein Degraders via Nickel Electrocatalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract: C&#8722;C linked glutarimide&#8208;containing structures with direct utility in the preparation of cereblon&#8208;based degraders (PROTACs, CELMoDs) can be assessed in a single step from inexpensive, commercial &#945;&#8208;bromoglutaramide through a unique Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid assisted Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic approach. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups that are historically problematic and can be applied to the simplified synthesis of dozens of known compounds that have only been procured through laborious, wasteful, multi&#8208;step sequences. The reaction is scalable in both batch and flow and features a trivial procedure wherein the most time&#8208;consuming aspect of reaction setup is weighing out the starting materials.

         <title>Dimeric Giant Molecule Acceptors Featuring N&#8208;type Linker: Enhancing Intramolecular Coupling for High&#8208;Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant molecular acceptors are typically designed with different linkers to tune their intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Unlike prior approaches using p&#8208;type linkers, here we explore an n&#8208;type linker, notably the benzothiadiazole unit, affording BT&#8208;DL via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation. It exhibits stronger intramolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling compared to its benzene&#8208;linked counterpart, leading to better device efficiency.







Abstract
Giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) are typically designed through the conjugated linking of individual small molecule acceptors (SMAs). This design imparts an extended molecular size, elevating the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to their SMA counterparts. Consequently, it effectively suppresses the thermodynamic relaxation of the acceptor component when blended with polymer donors to construct stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Despite their merits, the optimization of their chemical structure for further enhancing of device performance remains challenge. Different from previous reports utilizing p&#8208;type linkers, here, we explore an n&#8208;type linker, specifically the benzothiadiazole unit, to dimerize the SMA units via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation, affording BT&#8208;DL. In comparison with B&#8208;DL with a benzene linkage, BT&#8208;DL exhibits significantly stronger intramolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling, a desirable property for the acceptor component. Furthermore, BT&#8208;DL demonstrates a higher film absorption coefficient, redshifted absorption, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of BT&#8208;DL translate into a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.49&#8201;% in PSCs, a substantial improvement over the 9.17&#8201;% efficiency observed in corresponding devices with B&#8208;DL as the acceptor. Notably, the BT&#8208;DL based device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1000&#8197;hours of thermal stress at 90&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a cost&#8208;effective approach to the synthesis of n&#8208;type linker&#8208;dimerized GMAs, and highlight their potential advantage in enhancing intramolecular coupling for more efficient and durable photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Supported Silver Catalysts through Al modification for Efficient Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we synthesized an Ag/Al&#8722;MnO2 catalyst by metal&#8208;modification engineering to simultaneously improve the catalytic activity and selectivity for ethylene epoxidation. Experimental and theoretical resultsshowed that the Al modification tailored the 3d state of Ag on MnO2 through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs). These targeted effects enhanced the catalytic selectivity and overcame the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in heterogeneous catalysis, providing a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for heterogeneous oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;modified catalysts have attracted extraordinary research attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their enhanced geometric and electronic structures and outstanding catalytic performances. Silver (Ag) possesses necessary active sites for ethylene epoxidation, but the catalyst activity is usually sacrificed to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene oxide (EO). Herein, we report that using Al can help in tailoring the unoccupied 3d state of Ag on the MnO2 support through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs), overcoming the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for ethylene epoxidation and resulting in a very high ethylene conversion rate (~100&#8201;%) with 90&#8201;% selectivity for EO under mild conditions (170&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSIs obtained by the Al modification tailor the unoccupied 3d state of Ag, modulating the adsorption of ethylene (C2H4) and oxygen (O2) and facilitating EO desorption, resulting in high C2H4 conversion. Meanwhile, the increased number of positively charge Ag+ lowers the energy barrier for C2H4(ads) oxidation to produce oxametallacycle (OMC), inducing the unexpectedly high EO selectivity. Such an extraordinary electronic promotion provides new promising pathways for designing advanced metal catalysts with high activity and selectivity in selective oxidation reactions.

         <title>Cell Membrane as A Promising Therapeutic Target: From Materials Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, tumor cell membrane possessing the unique structure and diverse functions has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target. In this review, diverse treatments aiming at cell membrane based on functional materials are summarized and discussed, ranging from well&#8208;known photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT), in situ self&#8208;assembly/biosynthesis to newly emerged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation.







Abstract
The cell membrane is a crucial component of cells, protecting their integrity and stability while facilitating signal transduction and information exchange. Therefore, disrupting its structure or impairing its functions can potentially cause irreversible cell damage. Presently, the tumor cell membrane is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for various treatment methods. Given the extensive research focused on cell membranes, it is both necessary and timely to discuss these developments, from materials design to specific biomedical applications. This review covers treatments based on functional materials targeting the cell membrane, ranging from well&#8208;known membrane&#8208;anchoring photodynamic therapy to recent lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation. The diverse therapeutic mechanisms are introduced in the following sections: membrane&#8208;anchoring phototherapy, self&#8208;assembly on the membrane, in situ biosynthesis on the membrane, and degradation of cell membrane proteins by chimeras. In each section, we outline the conceptual design or general structure derived from numerous studies, emphasizing representative examples to understand advancements and draw inspiration. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future directions in membrane&#8208;targeted therapy from our perspective. This review aims to engage multidisciplinary readers and encourage researchers in related fields to advance the fundamental theories and practical applications of membrane&#8208;targeting therapeutic agents.

         <title>Lattice Strained Induced Spin Regulation in Co&#8722;N/S Coordination&#8208;Framework Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment in Co coordination polymers is regulated by compressive lattice strain to change the spin charge densities around S atoms, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with *OOH intermediates to promote the ORR performance.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT=2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) with 2&#8201;% lattice compression exhibits a superior half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin&#8208;charge densities around S atoms for Co&#8208;DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.

&lt;p&gt;The microenvironment in Co coordination polymers is regulated by compressive lattice strain to change the spin charge densities around S atoms, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with *OOH intermediates to promote the ORR performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature-pressure-induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co-DABDT (DABDT=2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-dithiol) with 2&#8201;% lattice compression exhibits a superior half-wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin-charge densities around S atoms for Co-DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MXene&#8208;mediated Interfacial Growth of 2D&#8208;2D Heterostructured Nanomaterials as Cathodes for Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the MXene&#8208;mediated interfacial growth of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructured nanomaterials. Benefitting from the synergistic effects and interfacial interactions, 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures achieved outstanding structural stability and chemical reversibility in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene heterostructures featuring a sandwiched and cross&#8208;linked network structure. This method addresses the common issue of activity degradation in 2D nanomaterials caused by inevitable aggregation. By utilizing the distinct surface characteristics of MXene, we successfully induced the growth of various 2D nanomaterials on MXene substrates. This strategy effectively mitigates self&#8208;stacking defects and augments the exposure of surface areas. In particular, the obtained 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures exhibit enhanced structural stability, improved chemical reversibility, and heightened charge transfer efficiency, outperforming pure NiCo LDH. The aqueous MH&#8722;Ni4Co1//Zn@carbon cloth (MH&#8722;Ni4Co1//Zn@CC) battery demonstrates exceptional performance with a remarkable specific capacity of 0.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining 96.6&#8201;% capacitance after 2300&#8197;cycles. Additionally, it achieves an energy density of 1.047&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 32.899&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research not only paves the way for new design paradigms in energy&#8208;related nanomaterials but also offers invaluable insights for the application and optimization of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Polymers Constructed from Dynamic Coordination Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing materials capable of adapting their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli is the key to preventing failure and extending their service life. However, existing mechanically adaptive polymers are hindered by limitations such as inadequate load&#8208;bearing capacity, difficulty in achieving reversible changes, high cost, and a lack of multiple responsiveness. Herein, we address these challenges using dynamic coordination bonds. A new type of mechanically adaptive material with both rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsiveness was developed. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the coordination equilibria, the prepared polymers, PBMBD&#8208;Fe and PBMBD&#8208;Co, exhibit mechanically adaptive properties, including temperature&#8208;sensitive strength modulation and rate&#8208;dependent impact hardening. Benefitting from the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, the polymers exhibited impressive energy dissipation, damping capacity (loss factors of 1.15 and 2.09 at 1.0 Hz), self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing abilities, offering durable and customizable impact resistance and protective performance. The development of impact&#8208;resistant materials with comprehensive properties has potential applications in the sustainable and intelligent protection fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Designed Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable and efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production is of great importance and challenge. In this study, synthesis of three photoactive cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) in an alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fashion is presented. In combination with triazine&#8208;derived electron acceptor, PAF&#8208;363 exhibits high efficiency for photosynthesis of H2O2 with a production rate of 11733 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1(with sacrificial agent) and 3930 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (without sacrificial agent) from water and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer positions and the O2 adsorption sites in PAF&#8208;363 are both concentrated on COTh fragments, which facilitate the H2O2 production through oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. This work highlights that the rational design of COTh&#8208;PAFs with consideration of D&#8208;A direction, charge transfer positions, and O2 adsorption sites provides a feasible access to efficient H2O2 production photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting Lewis Acidity: Machine&#8208;Learning the Fluoride Ion Affinity of p&#8208;Block&#8208;Atom&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI&#8208;DSD&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c level of theory, including 13 different p&#8208;block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The vast amount of data allowed for hitherto unmatched correlations with other Lewis acidity descriptors, serving the qualitative understanding of Lewis acidity. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA&#8208;GNN, two message&#8208;passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1 (r2 = 0.93) from the SMILES strings of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1 spanned by the FIA49k dataset. The model&#8217;s value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA&#8208;GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (grebgroup.de/fia&#8208;gnn).</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely engineering asymmetric atomic CoN4 by electron donating and extracting for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonpyrolytic catalysts featuring precisely defined active sites represents an effective strategy for investigating the fundamental relationship between the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and their local coordination environments. In this study, we have synthesized a series of model electrocatalysts with well&#8208;defined CoN4 centers and nonplanar symmetric coordination structures. These catalysts were prepared by a sequential process involving the chelation of cobalt salts and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based ligands with various substituent groups (phen(X), where X = OH, CH3, H, Br, Cl) onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). By modulating the electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the substituent groups on the phen&#8208;based ligands, we were able to effectively control the electron density surrounding the CoN4 centers. Our results demonstrated a direct correlation between the catalytic activity of the CoN4 centers and the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group on the phenanthroline ligands. Notably, the catalyst denoted as BCTF&#8208;Co&#8208;phen(OH), featuring the electron&#8208;donating OH group, exhibited the highest ORR catalytic activity. This custom&#8208;crafted catalyst achieved a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.80 V vs. RHE and an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) value of 47.4&#215;10&#8208;3 Hz at 0.80 V vs. RHE&#160;in an alkaline environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Chalcogen Squares for Material and Topological Control over Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we introduce chalcogen squares via selenadiazole motifs as a new class of dynamic supramolecular bonding interactions for the modification and control of soft matter materials. We showcase selenadiazole motifs in supramolecular networks of varying primary chain length prepared through polymerization using tandem step&#8208;growth/Passerini multicomponent reactions (MCRs). Compared to controls lacking the selenadiazole motif, these networks display increased glass transition temperatures and moduli due to the chalcogen bonding linkages formed between chains. These elastomeric networks were shown to autonomously heal at room temperature, retaining up to 83% of the ultimate tensile strength. Lastly, we use post&#8208;polymerization modification via the Biginelli MCR to add selenadiazole motifs to narrowly dispersed polymers for controlled topology in solution. Chalcogen squares via selenadiazoles introduce an exciting exchange mechanism to the realm of dynamic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Self&#8208;Expanding Metal&#8211;Organic Cages Using a Ring&#8208;Openable Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), which are formed via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, are being extensively developed for various applications owing to the utility of their accessible molecular&#8208;sized cavity. While MOC structures are uniquely and precisely predetermined by the metal coordination number and ligand configuration, tailoring MOCs to further modulate the size, shape, and chemical environment of the cavities has become intensively studied for a more efficient and adaptive molecular binding. Herein, we report self&#8208;expanding MOCs that exhibit remarkable structural variations in cage size and flexibility while maintaining their topology. A cyclic ligand with an oligomeric chain tethering the two benzene rings of stilbene was designed and mixed with RhII ions to obtain the parent MOCs. These MOCs were successfully transformed into expanded MOCs via the selective cleavage of the double bond in stilbene. The expanded MOCs could effectively trap multidentate N&#8208;donor molecules in their enlarged cavity, in contrast to the original MOCs with a narrow cavity. As the direct synthesis of expanded MOCs is impractical because of the entropically disfavored structures, self&#8208;expansion using ring&#8208;openable ligands is a promising approach that allows precision engineering and the production of functional MOCs that would otherwise be inaccessible.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Cofeeding Affects Product Distribution in CH3Cl Coupling over ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite: Pressure Twists the Plot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C1 coupling reactions over zeolite catalysts are central to sustainable chemical production strategies. However, questions persist regarding the involvement of CO in ketene formation, and the impact of this elusive oxygenate intermediate on reactivity patterns. Using&#160;operando&#160;photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), we investigate&#160;the role of CO in methyl chloride conversion to hydrocarbons (MCTH), a prospective process for methane valorization with a reaction network akin to methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) but without oxygenate intermediates. Our findings reveal the transformative role of CO in MCTH at the low pressures, inducing ketene formation in MCTH and boosting olefin production, confirming the Koch carbonylation step in the initial stages of C1 coupling. We uncover pressure&#8208;dependent product distributions driven by CO&#8209;induced ketene formation, and its subsequent desorption from the zeolite surface, which is enhanced at low pressure. Inspired by the above results, extension of the co&#8208;feeding approach to CH3OH as another simple oxygenate showcases the additional potential for improved catalyst stability in MCTH at ambient pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Intermediate Adsorption over PdM (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) Bimetallene for Boosted Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NO3RR) is a promising and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for ammonia production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the eight&#8208;electron transfer process and poor mechanistic understanding strongly impedes its application. To unveil the internal laws, herein, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8208;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants break the electronic balance and upshift its d&#8208;band center, thus optimizing intermediates adsorption. The anisotropic electronic characteristics of these transition metals make the NO3RR activity in the order of PdCu &gt; PdCo &#8776; PdFe &gt; PdNi &gt; Pd, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 295 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 along with Faradaic efficiency of 90.9% is achieved in neutral electrolyte on PdCu bimetallene. Detailed studies further reveal that the moderate N&#8208;species (*NO3 and *NO2) adsorption ability, enhanced *NO activation, and reduced HER activity facilitate the NH3 production. We believe our results will give a systematic guidance to the future design of NO3RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH by Rhenium Atomically Dispersed on Indium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven photoreduction of CO2 is promising in alleviating environment burden, but suffers from low efficiency and over&#8208;reliance on sacrificial agents. Herein, rhenium (Re) is atomically dispersed in In2O3 to fabricate a 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst. In sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2 with H2O, 2Re&#8208;In2O3 shows a long&#8208;term stable efficiency which is enhanced by 3.5 times than that of pure In2O3 and is also higher than those on Au&#8208;In2O3, Ag&#8208;In2O3, Cu&#8208;In2O3, Ir&#8208;In2O3, Ru&#8208;In2O3, Rh&#8208;In2O3 and Pt&#8208;In2O3 photocatalysts. Moreover, carbon&#8208;based product of the photoreduction overturns from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. Re promotes charge separation, H2O dissociation and CO2 activation, thus enhancing photoreduction efficiency of CO2 on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. During the photoreduction, CO is a key intermediate. CO prefers to desorption rather than hydrogenation on pure In2O3, as CO binds to pure In2O3 very weakly. Re strengthens the interaction of CO with 2Re&#8208;In2O3 by 5.0 times, thus limiting CO desorption but enhancing CO hydrogenation to CH3OH. This could be the origin for photoreduction product overturn from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. The present work opens a new way to boost sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral B&#8208;N Adduct as a New Frontier in Ferroelectrics and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B&#8208;N Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base pairs to yield B&#8208;N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B&#8208;N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA&#8208;BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave a rectangular P&#8208;E hysteresis loop with a remnant&#160;polarization of 7.65 &#181;C cm&#8208;2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density&#8208;functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop&#8208;casted film of RMBA&#8208;BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude&#8208;bias butterfly and phase&#8208;bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA&#8208;BF3&#160;was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5 pC N&#8208;1&#160;for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as&#8208;made crystals of RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2 V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B&#8208;N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B-N Lewis acid-base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard-soft acid-base pairs to yield B-N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B-N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA-BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA-BF3 gave a rectangular P-E hysteresis loop with a remnant&#160;polarization of 7.65 &#181;C cm-2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density-functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop-casted film of RMBA-BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude-bias butterfly and phase-bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA-BF3&#160;was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5 pC N-1&#160;for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as-made crystals of RMBA-BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2 V.

         <title>Tailoring Second Coordination Sphere for Tunable Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Charge Transfer toward Enhanced Photoelectrochemical H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8208;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H2 production performance. Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H2 production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2, which contains an electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8208;SO3H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat&#8208;band potential of the polished p&#8208;Si photocathode and nanoporous p&#8208;Si photocathode by 81 mV and 124 mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95% for H2 production, which is well maintained during 18 h and 21h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band&#8208;edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8208;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Hetero[9]helicene Toward Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes BN[9]H have been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step approach. The intrinsic helical structure and its multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence endows it with outstanding chiroptical properties. Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with M&#8208;/P&#8208;BN[9]H used as emitters exhibit a high EQEmax of 35.5&#8201;% and intense circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with a |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
The intrinsic helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton makes helicenes highly promising for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). Generally, carbon helicenes undergo low external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the incorporation of a multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) BN structure has led to an improvement. However, the reported B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes all show low electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), typically around 1&#215;10&#8722;3. Therefore, the development of B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes with both a high EQE and gEL value is crucial for achieving highly efficient CPEL. Herein, a facile approach to synthesize B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes, BN[9]H, is presented. BN[9]H shows a bright photoluminescence with a maximum at 578&#8197;nm with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to its inherited MR&#8208;TADF property and intrinsic helical skeleton. Furthermore, circularly polarized OLED devices incorporating BN[9]H as an emitter show a maximum EQE of 35.5&#8201;%, a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm, and, more importantly, a high |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3. The Q&#8208;factor (|EQE&#215;gEL|) of CP&#8208;OLEDs is determined to be 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.

         <title>A non&#8208;metal single atom nanozyme for cutting off the energy and reducing power of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE) was developed as a biosafe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts. SeSAE exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimic activity, effectively disrupting cellular energy and reduction equivalents to suppress tumors. The comprehensive investigation of SeSAE, from theoretical calculations to in vivo antitumor pathways, promises valuable insights into the translation of single atom nanozymes.







Abstract
Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin macrocycle is designed, which fuses quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties. A high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, improved average voltage, outstanding energy density and durable cyclability.







Abstract
Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08&#8197;V), and outstanding energy density (365&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 71.6&#8201;% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), boosted average voltage (1.08&#8197;V), and outstanding energy density (365&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TNP&lt;/sub&gt;). Moreover, the extended &#960;-conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti-dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 71.6&#8201;% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox-bipolar organics for state-of-the-art ZOBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Dual&#8208;atom catalysts present a promising catalytic platform for improving activity and selectivity simultaneously. In their Research Article (e202401168), Xiaohao Liu et&#8197;al. develop a universal &#8220;photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition&#8221; strategy to precisely construct In2O3&#8208;supported diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites. The strong synergism on the Angstrom scale accelerates *H spillover and electron transfer from Pd to Ir. This as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

         <title>Two Sesterterpene Synthases from Lentzea atacamensis Demonstrate the Role of Conformational Variability in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of Lentzea atacamensis uncovered two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases with the main products lentzeadiene and atacamatriene. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was observed, reminiscent of vitamin D3 biosynthesis. The cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations, showing the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.







Abstract
Mining of two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases from Lentzea atacamensis resulted in the identification of the synthases for lentzeadiene (LaLDS) and atacamatriene (LaATS). The main product of LaLDS (lentzeadiene) is a new compound, while one of the side products (lentzeatetraene) is the enantiomer of brassitetraene B and the other side product (sestermobaraene F) is known from a surprisingly distantly related sesterterpene synthase. LaATS produces six new compounds, one of which is the enantiomer of the known sesterterpene Bm1. Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.

         <title>Peptide Stapling by Crosslinking Two Amines with &#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by the crosslinking of two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents has been developed. Except for Cys, all unprotected proteinogenic amino acids are tolerated. The reactivity of Arg side chains can be effectively suppressed. The use of HFIP solvent is the key to achieving high reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes as a Precursor for Regiodivergent Alkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity. Herein we reported the complemental character of hypervalent bromines, as aryne precursors and their behavior under transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.







Abstract
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for the alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept on matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration has been proposed in this work, which provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for future battery design.







Abstract
Widely acknowledged that the capacity of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) should be strongly determined by growth behaviors of the discharge product of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that follows both coexisting surface and solution pathways. However until now, it remains still challenging to achieve dynamic modulation on Li2O2 morphologies. Herein, the photo&#8208;responsive Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced oxide graphene (Au/rGO) have been utilized as cathode to manipulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by aid of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects. Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li+ concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.

         <title>A Platform Approach to Cleavable Macrocycles for the Controlled Disassembly of Mechanically Caged Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical lock with many keys. We show that a single macrocyclic precursor can be converted to self&#8208;immolative macrocycles that open in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. Rotaxanes and catenanes based on these rings can be triggered to release their interlocked partner. This simple macrocycle platform can be used to accelerate the development of mechanically caged molecules.







Abstract
Inspired by interlocked oligonucleotides, peptides and knotted proteins, synthetic systems where a macrocycle cages a bioactive species that is &#8220;switched on&#8221; by breaking the mechanical bond have been reported. However, to date, each example uses a bespoke chemical design. Here we present a platform approach to mechanically caged structures wherein a single macrocycle precursor is diversified at a late stage to include a range of trigger units that control ring opening in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to other classes of macrocycles suitable for rotaxane and catenane formation.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Linker Strategy for Selective Activation of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy to overcome the off&#8208;target toxicity of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a hypoxia&#8208;activated, azobenzene&#8208;based linker for the tumour&#8208;specific release of cytotoxic payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The novel ADC exhibits potent antitumor efficacy and dramatically increases the therapeutic window compared with a traditional ADC, providing a dual&#8208;targeting antibody/linker double prodrug (pro&#8208;prodrug).Author response: This edition is OK.







Abstract
Existing antibody&#8211;drug conjugate (ADC) linkers, whether cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable, are designed to release highly toxic payloads or payload derivatives upon internalisation of the ADCs into cells. However, clinical studies have shown that only &lt;1&#8201;% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in tumour cells. The remaining &gt;99&#8201;% of ADCs are nonspecifically distributed in healthy tissue cells, thus inevitably leading to off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we describe an intelligent tumour&#8208;specific linker strategy to address these limitations. A tumour&#8208;specific linker is constructed by introducing a hypoxia&#8208;activated azobenzene group as a toxicity controller. We show that this azobenzene&#8208;based linker is non&#8208;cleavable in healthy tissues (O2 &gt;10&#8201;%), and the corresponding payload derivative, cysteine&#8208;appended azobenzene&#8208;linker&#8211;monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), can serve as a safe prodrug to mask the toxicity of MMAE (switched off). Upon exposure to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment (O2&lt;1&#8201;%), this linker is cleaved to release MMAE and fully restores the high cytotoxicity of the ADC (switched on). Notably, the azobenzene linker&#8208;containing ADC exhibits satisfactory antitumour efficacy in vivo and a larger therapeutic window compared with ADCs containing traditional cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable linkers. Thus, our azobenzene&#8208;based linker sheds new light on the development of next&#8208;generation ADC linkers.

         <title>The Role of Phase Mixing Degree in Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction on Cu&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation on defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction by mixing various phases. The efficiency of C&#8722;C coupling increased with phase mixing degree of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, with a maximum FE of 81&#8201;% toward C2+ products. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the increased phase mixing degree facilitated *CO formation and retention at low and high overpotential, respectively.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C&#8722;C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu&#8208;based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81&#8201;% at maximum. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C&#8722;C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C&#8722;C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu&#8208;base catalysts.

         <title>Directing in Vitro Selection towards G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming Aptamers to Inhibit HMGB1 Pathological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of G&#8208;rich oligonucleotides, effective G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming aptamers against HMGB1, a protein involved in inflammation and cancer, were identified. L12 was selected as the best performing aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, along with strong anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity and good HMGB1&#8208;binding affinity, which indicate it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.







Abstract
In the search for novel, effective inhibitors of High&#8208;Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1)&#8212;a protein involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer&#8212;we herein discovered a set of anti&#8208;HMGB1 G&#8208;quadruplex(G4)&#8208;forming aptamers by using an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotides. The selected DNA sequences were then studied in a pseudo&#8208;physiological buffer mimicking the extracellular medium, where HMGB1 exerts its pathological activity, using spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and chromatographic techniques. All the oligonucleotides proved to fold into monomeric G4s and in some cases also dimeric species, stable at physiological temperature. Remarkably, the protein preferentially recognized the sequences forming dimeric parallel G4 structures, as evidenced by a properly designed chemiluminescent binding assay which also highlighted a good selectivity of these aptamers for HMGB1. Moreover, all aptamers showed anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity, inhibiting protein&#8208;induced cell migration. The acquired data allowed identifying L12 as the best anti&#8208;HMGB1 aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, no toxicity at least up to 5&#8197;&#956;M concentration on healthy cells, along with potent anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity (IC50 ca. 28&#8197;nM) and good binding affinity for the protein, thus indicating it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.

         <title>Enhancing Flavins Photochemical Activity in Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Triplet Sensitization through Ring&#8208;Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of ester&#8208;modified flavins with hydroxide base leads to ring&#8208;contracted imidazolonequinoxalines with increased triplet energy (ET) and H&#8208;atom abstraction (HAT) strength in the photochemically excited state. Ring&#8208;contracted flavins are efficient catalysts in the trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic C&#8722;H positions and also in multi&#8208;step sequences, which require the combined activity as triplet sensitizer and hydrogen atom abstractor.







Abstract
The isoalloxazine heterocycle of flavin cofactors reacts with various nucleophiles to form covalent adducts with important functions in enzymes. Molecular flavin models allow for the characterization of such adducts and the study of their properties. A fascinating set of reactions occurs when flavins react with hydroxide base, which leads to imidazolonequinoxalines, ring&#8208;contracted flavins, with so far unexplored activity. We report a systematic study of the photophysical properties of this new chromophore by absorption and emission spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Excited, ring&#8208;contracted flavins are significantly stronger hydrogen atom abstractors when compared to the parent flavins, which allowed the direct trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic methine positions (bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 400.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). In an orthogonal activity, their increased triplet energy (E(S0&#8592;T1)=244&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) made sensitized reactions possible which exceeded the power of standard flavins. Combining both properties, ring&#8208;contracted flavin catalysts enabled the one&#8208;pot, five&#8208;step transformation of &#945;&#8208;tropolone into trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentanones. We envision this new class of flavin&#8208;derived chromophores to open up new modes of reactivity that are currently impossible with unmodified flavins.

         <title>Accessing Mg&#8208;Ion Storage in V2PS10 via Combined Cationic&#8208;Anionic Redox with Selective Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium batteries attract interest as alternative energy&#8208;storage devices because of elemental abundance and potential for high energy density. Development is limited by the absence of suitable cathodes, associated with poor diffusion kinetics resulting from strong interactions between Mg2+ and the host structure. V2PS10 is reported as a positive electrode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries. Cyclable capacity of 100 mAh g&#8208;1 is achieved with fast Mg2+ diffusion of 7.2[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;11&#8208;4[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;14 cm2s&#8208;1. The fast insertion mechanism results from combined cationic redox on the V site and anionic redox on the (S2)2&#8208; site; enabled by reversible cleavage of S&#8211;S bonds, identified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed structural characterisation with maximum entropy method analysis, supported by density functional theory calculations and projected density of states analysis, reveals that the sulphur species involved in anion redox are not connected to the transition metal centres, spatially separating the two redox processes. This facilitates fast and reversible Mg insertion in which the nature of the redox process depends on the cation insertion site, creating a synergy between the occupancy of specific Mg sites and the location of the electrons transferred.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Afterglow Nanotorches for In Vivo Tracing of Cell&#8208;Based Microrobots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the self&#8208;luminescence imaging approaches that require pre&#8208;illumination instead of real&#8208;time light excitation, afterglow luminescence imaging has attracted increasing enthusiasm to circumvent tissue autofluorescence. In this work, we developed organic afterglow luminescent nanoprobe (nanotorch), which could emit persistent luminescence more than 10 days upon single light excitation. More importantly, the nanotorch could be remote charged by 660 nm light in a non&#8208;invasive manner, which showed great potential for real&#8208;time tracing the location of macrophage cell&#8208;based microrobots.</dc:description>

         <title>Changing Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with a Reversible Rotaxane Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transmission of chiral information between the molecular, meso and microscopic scales is a facet of biology that remains challenging to understand mechanistically and to mimic with artificial systems. Here we demonstrate that the dynamic change in the expression of the chirality of a rotaxane can be transduced into a change in pitch of a soft matter system. Shuttling the position of the macrocycle from far&#8208;away&#8208;from to close&#8208;to a point&#8208;chiral center on the rotaxane axle changes the expression of the chiral information that is transmitted across length scales; from nanometer scale constitutional chirality that affects the conformation of the macrocycle, to the centimeter scale chirality of the liquid crystal phase, significantly changing the pitch length of the chiral nematic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrating Excited State Energy on Non&#8208;Radiative Decay Pathways with Fused Azulenyl Squaraine Derivatives for Improving Second Near&#8208;Infrared Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) theranostics offer new opportunities for precise disease phototheranostic due to the enhanced tissue penetration and higher maximum permissible exposure of NIR&#8208;II light. However, traditional regimens lacking effective NIR&#8208;II absorption and uncontrollable excited&#8208;state energy decay pathways often result in insufficient theranostic outcomes. Herein a phototheranostic nano&#8208;agent (PS&#8208;1 NPs) based on azulenyl squaraine derivatives with a strong NIR&#8208;II absorption band centered at 1092 nm is reported, allowing almost all absorbed excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, leading to high photothermal conversion efficiency (90.98%) and strong photoacoustic response. Both in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic/photothermal therapy results demonstrate enhanced deep tissue cancer theranostic performance of PS&#8208;1 NPs. Even in the 5 mm deep&#8208;seated tissue tumor model, PS&#8208;1 NPs demonstrated a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor effect in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, for the human extracted tooth root canal infection model, the synergistic outcomes of the photothermal effect of PS&#8208;1 NPs and 0.5% NaClO solution resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to the clinical gold standard irrigation agent 5.25% NaClO, opening up possibilities for the expansion of NIR&#8208;II theranostic agents in oral medicine.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show wide application as the cathode of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) in the future owning to their high porosity, diverse structures, abundant species, and controllable morphology.

Herein, an innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed and demonstrated to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, its energy storage mechanism is systematically investigated. Moreover, profiting from the coordination effect, the Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 features with stable structure in ZnSO4 electrolyte. Therefore, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability. This work aids in the future development of MOFs in AZIBs</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Heck Coupling and Allylboration of Iododiboron Compounds via Diboryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geminal bis(boronates) are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. The fact that they predominantly serve as nucleophiles in the previous reports, however, has restrained their synthetic potential. Herein we disclose the ambiphilic reactivity of &#945;&#8208;halogenated geminal bis(boronates), of which the first catalytic utilization was accomplished by merging a formal Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a highly diastereoselective allylboration of aldehydes or imines, providing a new avenue for rapid assembly of polyfunctionalized boron&#8208;containing compounds. We demonstrated that this cascade reaction is highly efficient and compatible with various functional groups, and a wide range of heterocycles. In contrast to a classical Pd(0/II) scenario, mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations have provided strong evidence for a catalytic cycle involving Pd(I)/diboryl carbon radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis and Reactivity of Naphthoquinonynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first systematic exploration of the synthesis and reactivity of naphthoquinonynes is described. Routes to two regiosomeric Kobayashi&#8208;type naphthoquinonyne precursors have been developed, and the reactivity of the ensuing 6,7&#8208; and 5,6&#8208;aryne intermediates has been investigated. Remarkably, these studies have revealed that a broad range of cycloadditions, nucleophile additions and difunctionalizations can be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the highly sensitive quinone unit. The methodologies offer a powerful diversity oriented approach to C6 and C7 functionalized naphthoquinones, which are typically challenging to access. From a reactivity viewpoint, the study is significant because it demonstrates that aryne&#8208;based functionalizations can be utilized strategically in the presence of highly reactive and directly competing functionality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of the amine&#8208;stabilized alane (NMe3)&#8729;AlH3&#160;1&#160;with the backbone&#8208;saturated&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) SIDipp (SIDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) at 0&#176;C yielded the NHC alane adduct (SIDipp)&#8729;AlH3&#160;2. Reaction at elevated temperatures or prolonged reaction at room temperature gave the product of a ring expansion reaction (RER) of the NHC,&#160;3&#8729;(NMe3).

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Structural Fine Tuning of Chromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanoid carboxylates were synthesized, in situ self&#8208;assembled in primitive crystals to illustrate temperature&#8208;driven evolution in chromaticity. Evolution in structure (crystallinity), composition, luminosity and chromaticity investigated revealing the coupled role of divergence in order/structure (spatial organization), and composition in tuning observed color. Loss of crystallinity or increase in residual carbon leads to decrease in luminosity even with increase in hue. Comparing Ho and Er congeners shows that the density of accessible transitions relates to shifts in low and high wavelength components of color. This work demonstrates that, just as interface dipoles can lead to change in semiconductor bandgap, structure and composition can analogously alter observed color.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Entwined Topology in Helical Covalent Polymers Dictated by Competing Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring polymeric structures often consist of 1D polymer chains intricately folded and entwined through non&#8208;covalent bonds, adopting precise topologies crucial for their functionality. The exploration of crystalline 1D polymers through dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) and supramolecular interactions represents a novel approach for developing crystalline polymers. This study shows that sub&#8208;angstrom differences in the counter&#8208;ion size can lead to various helical covalent polymer (HCP) topologies, including a novel metal&#8208;coordination HCP (m&#8208;HCP) motif. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of HCP&#8208;Na revealed double helical pairs are formed by sodium&#8208;ions coordinating to spiroborate linkages to form rectangular pores. The double helices are interpenetrated by the unreacted diols coordinating sodium&#8208;ions. The reticulation of the m&#8208;HCP structure was demonstrated by the successful synthesis of HCP&#8208;K. Finally, ion&#8208;exchange studies were conducted to show the interconversion between HCP structures. This research illustrates how seemingly simple modifications, such as changes in counter&#8208;ion size, can significantly influence the polymer topology and determine which supramolecular interactions dominate the crystal lattice.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;cycling and High&#8208;voltage Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Fluorinated and Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), constructed through the in&#8208;situ fabrication of polymer electrolytes, are considered a critical strategy for the next&#8208;generation battery systems with high energy density and enhanced safety. However, the constrained oxidation stability of polymers, such as the extensively utilized polyethers, limits their applications in high&#8208;voltage batteries and further energy density improvements. Herein, an in&#8208;situ fabricated fluorinated and crosslinked polyether&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte, FGPE, is presented, exhibiting a high oxidation potential (5.1 V). The fluorinated polyether significantly improves compatibility with both lithium metal and high&#8208;voltage cathode, attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8208;CF3 group and the generated LiF&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interphase. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries employing FGPE demonstrate exceptional cycling performances of 1000 cycles with 78% retention, representing one of the best results ever reported for polymer electrolytes. Moreover, FGPE enables batteries to operate at 4.7 V, realizing the highest operating voltage of polyether&#8208;based batteries to date. Notably, our designed in&#8208;situ FGPE provides the solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling stability even at practical conditions, including high cathode loading (21 mg cm&#8208;2) and industry&#8208;level 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells (1.3 Ah, 500 cycles). This work provides critical insights into the development of oxidation&#8208;stable polymer electrolytes and the advancement of practical high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Enables the Cathodic Interface Reaction Reversibility in Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited triple&#8208;phase boundaries arising from the accumulation of solid discharge product(s) in solid&#8208;state cathodes (SSCs) pose a challenge to high&#8208;property solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (SSLOBs). Light&#8208;assisted SSLOBs have been gradually explored as an ingenious system; however, the fundamental mechanisms of the SSCs interface behavior remain unclear. Here, we discovered that light assistance can enhance the fast inner&#8208;sphere charge transfer in SSCs and regulate the discharge products with spherical particles generated via the surface growth model. Moreover, the high photoelectron excitation and transportation capabilities of SSCs can retard cathodic catalytic decay by avoiding structural degradation of the cathode with a reduced charge voltage. The light&#8208;induced SSLOBs exhibited excellent stability (170 cycles) with a low discharge&#8211;charge polarization overpotential (0.27 V). Furthermore, transparent SSLOBs with exceptional flexibility, mechanical stability, and multiform shapes were fabricated for theory&#8208;to&#8208;practical applications in sunlight&#8208;induced batteries. Our study opens new opportunities for the introduction of solar energy into energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Phenanthrene Imide&#8208;Based Polymers for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors are crucial for the applications of organic electronics, however strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties for constructing them are still limited. The imide&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, high electron deficiency and good solubility serve as promising candidates for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers. Among these PAHs, phenanthrene (PhA) features a well&#8208;delocalized aromatic &#960;&#8208;system with multiple active sites to functionalize. However, the PhA&#8208;based imides are seldom studied, mainly attributed to the synthetic challenge. Herein, we reported two functionalized PhA moieties, CPOI and CPCNI, by simultaneously incorporating imide with carbonyl or dicyanomethylene onto PhA. Notably, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;modified CPCNI exhibits a well stabilized LUMO energy level (&#8208;3.84 eV), attributed to the synergetic inductive effect from imide and cyano groups. Subsequently, based on CPOI and CPCNI, two polymers PCPOI&#8208;Tz and PCPCNI&#8208;Tz were developed. Applied to organic thin&#8208;film transistors, owing to the strong electron&#8208;deficient character of CPCNI, polymer PCPCNI&#8208;Tz shows an improved electron mobility and largely decreased threshold voltage compared with PCPOI&#8208;Tz. This work affords two structurally novel electron&#8208;deficient building blocks and highlights the effectiveness of dual functionalization of PhAs with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for devising n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Nanographenes Bearing Pentagon&#8208;Heptagon Pairs by Stepwise Dehydrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs into helical nanographenes lacks a facile synthetic route, and the impact of these pairs on chiroptical properties remains unclear. In this study, a method for the stepwise construction of pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs in helical nanographenes by the dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units was developed. Three helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs were synthesized and characterized using this approach. A wide variation in the molecular geometries and photophysical properties of these helical nanographenes was observed, with changes in the helical length of these structures and the introduction of the pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs. The embedded pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs reduced the oxidation potential of the synthesized helical nanographenes. The high isomerization energy barriers enabled the chiral resolution of the helicene enantiomers. Chiroptical investigations revealed remarkably enhanced circularly polarized luminescence and luminescence dissymmetry factors with an increasing number of the pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift for the Visualization of Rapid Protein and Nucleic Acid Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores, characterized by flexible chemical structure and adjustable optical performance, have shown tremendous potential in biosensing. However, classical organic fluorophore motifs feature large overlap between excitation and emission spectra, leading to the requirement of advanced optical set up to filter desired signal, which limits their application in scenarios with simple settings. Here, a series of wavelength&#8208;tunable small&#8208;molecule fluorescent dyes (  PTs  ) bearing simple organic moieties have been developed, which exhibit Stokes shift up to 262 nm, molar extinction coefficients ranged 30,000~100,000 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1, with quantum yields up to 54.8%. Furthermore, these dyes were formulated into fluorescent nanoparticles (  PT&#8208;NPs  ), and applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, limit of detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein reached 20 fM with naked eye, a 100&#8208;fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the pM detection level for colloidal gold&#8208;based LFA. Besides, combined with loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the LFA system achieved the visualization of single copy level nucleic acid detection for monkeypox (Mpox).</dc:description>

         <title>"Off&#8208;Label" Use of Enterobactin Enables Targeted Imaging of Cancer with Radioactive Ti(IV)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of inert, biocompatible chelation methods is required to harness the emerging positron emitting radionuclide&#160;45Ti for radiopharmaceutical applications.&#160;Herein, we evaluate the Ti(IV)&#8208;coordination chemistry of four catechol&#8208;based, hexacoordinate chelators using synthetic, structural, computational, and radiochemical approaches. The siderophore enterobactin (Ent) and its synthetic mimic TREN&#8208;CAM, readily form mononuclear Ti(IV)&#160;species in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Radiolabeling studies revealed that Ent and TREN&#8208;CAM form mononuclear complexes with the short&#8208;lived, positron&#8208;emitting radionuclide45Ti(IV), and that these complexes do not transchelate to plasma proteins in vitro and exhibit rapid renal clearance in na&#239;ve mice. These features guided efforts to target the&#160;45Ti isotope to prostate cancer tissue through the design, synthesis, and evaluation of Ent&#8208;DUPA, a small molecule conjugate composed of a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting peptide and a monofunctionalized Ent scaffold. The [45Ti][Ti(Ent&#8208;DUPA)]2&#8208;&#160;complex formed readily at room temperature and in a tumor xenograft model in mice, displayed selective tumor tissue accumulation (8&#177;&#160;5%, n=5), and low off&#8208;target uptake in other organs. Overall, this work demonstrates targeted imaging with&#160;45Ti(IV), provides a foundation for advancing the application of&#160;45Ti in nuclear medicine, and reveals that Ent can be repurposed as a&#160;45Ti&#8208;complexing cargo for targeted nuclear imaging applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized a quinone&#8208;incorporated bistriarylamine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) semiconductor molecule 1 by B(C6F5)3 (BCF) catalyzed C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H cross coupling via radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of Lewis acids BCF&#160;and Al(ORF)3 (RF = C(CF3)3) to the semiconductor 1 afforded diradical zwitterions 2 and 3 by integer electron transfer. Upon binding to Lewis acids, the LUMO energy of 1 is significantly lowered and the band gap of the semiconductor is significantly narrowed from 1.93 eV (1) to 1.01 eV (2) and 1.06 eV (3). 2 and 3 are rare near&#8208;infrared (NIR) diradical dyes with broad absorption both centered around 1500 nm. By introducing a photo BCF generator, 2 can be generated by light&#8208;dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH3CN. In addition, the temperature of 2 sharply increased and reached as high as 110 &#176;C in 10 s upon the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) laser (1064 nm, 0.7 W cm&#8208;2), exhibiting a fast response to laser. It displays excellent photothermal stability with a photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency of 62.26% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.</dc:description>

By introducing a photo BCF generator, 2 can be generated by light-dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH3CN. In addition, the temperature of 2 sharply increased and reached as high as 110 &#176;C in 10 s upon the irradiation of near-infrared-II (NIR-II) laser (1064 nm, 0.7 W cm-2), exhibiting a fast response to laser. It displays excellent photothermal stability with a photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency of 62.26% and high-quality PT imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Interfacial Active Gemini Surfactants as Simple and Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing, Lubricating and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid structuring usually relies on the interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants. Here we show that not only droplets in non&#8208;equilibrium shapes but also printed liquid patterns with useful geometries can be created from a highly interfacial active molecular Gemini surfactant that generates elastic, &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; monolayers at the oil/water interface. The surfactant can also be used to produce ultra&#8208;stable emulsions with potent lubricity.







Abstract
To date, locking the shape of liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium states usually relies on jamming nanoparticle surfactants at an oil/water interface. Here we show that a synthetic water&#8208;soluble zwitterionic Gemini surfactant can serve as an alternative to nanoparticle surfactants for stabilizing, structuring and additionally lubricating liquids. By having a high binding energy comparable to amphiphilic nanoparticles at the paraffin oil/water interface, the surfactant can attain near&#8208;zero interfacial tensions and ultrahigh surface coverages after spontaneous adsorption. Owing to the strong association between neighboring surfactant molecules, closely packed monolayers with high mechanical elasticity can be generated at the oil/water interface, thus allowing the surfactant to produce not only ultra&#8208;stable emulsions but also structured liquids with various geometries by using extrusion printing and 3D printing techniques. By undergoing tribochemical reactions at its sulfonic terminus, the surfactant can endow the resultant emulsions with favorable lubricity even under high load&#8208;bearing conditions. Our study may provide new insights into creating complex liquid devices and new&#8208;generation lubricants capable of combining the characteristics of both liquid and solid lubricants.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Difluoromethyl Carbonyl Compounds from N&#8208;Difluoromethylcarbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives was developed. The protocol utilizes a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides via desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride that can be further diversified to a diversity of N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds including amides, carbamates, ureas, thiocarbamates, and selenocarbamates with rich functionality.







Abstract
Fluorinated small molecules are commonly used in functional small&#8208;molecule chemistry, and N&#8208;difluoromethyl (N&#8208;CF2H) compounds are particularly intriguing due to their unique and unexplored physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, a general methodological approach to the synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H compounds remains elusive. Here, guided by computation, we present a simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives. The protocol involves a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides through desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride building blocks that can be further diversified to a variety of unexplored N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds with rich functionality. Additionally, preliminary studies on their properties and stability showcased their potential application in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleic Acids in a Diffusiophoretic Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steep salt gradient generated by an electrolyte&#8208;filled micropipette can be utilized for diffusiophoretic trapping of charged colloids and molecules. The trap can localize, concentrate and promote hybridization between complementary DNA strands, and facilitate the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures into DNA gels. Assembly of the gel only occurs under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, when the salt gradient is present.







Abstract
The formation and dissociation of duplexes or higher order structures from nucleic acid strands is a fundamental process with widespread applications in biochemistry and nanotechnology. Here, we introduce a simple experimental system&#8212;a diffusiophoretic trap&#8212;for the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly of nucleic acid structures that uses an electrolyte gradient as the driving force. DNA strands can be concentrated up to hundredfold by a diffusiophoretic trapping force that is caused by the electric field generated by the electrolyte gradient. We present a simple equation for the field to guide selection of appropriate trapping electrolytes. Experiments with carboxylated silica particles demonstrate that the diffusiophoretic force is long&#8208;ranged, extending over hundreds of micrometers. As an application, we explore the reversible self&#8208;assembly of branched DNA nanostructures in the trap into a macroscopic gel. The structures assemble in the presence of an electrolyte gradient, and disassemble upon its removal, representing a prototypical adaptive response to a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium state.

         <title>Zinc ion Batteries: Bridging the Gap from Academia to Industry for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) hold great promise for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the practical capability of ZIBs is ambiguous due to technical gaps between small scale laboratory coin cells and large commercial energy storage systems. This Minireview explores limiting factors for ZIBs practicality, using formulations to estimate practical energy density and predict battery lifespan in lab research activities.







Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) exhibit significant promise in the next generation of grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their safety, relatively high volumetric energy density, and low production cost. Despite substantial advancements in ZIBs, a comprehensive evaluation of critical parameters impacting their practical energy density (Epractical) and calendar life is lacking. Hence, we suggest using formulation&#8208;based study as a scientific tool to accurately calculate the cell&#8208;level energy density and predict the cycling life of ZIBs. By combining all key battery parameters, such as the capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode (N/P), into one formula, we assess their impact on Epractical. When all parameters are optimized, we urge to achieve the theoretical capacity for a high Epractical. Furthermore, we propose a formulation that correlates the N/P and Coulombic efficiency of ZIBs for predicting their calendar life. Finally, we offer a comprehensive overview of current advancements in ZIBs, covering cathode and anode, along with practical evaluations. This Minireview outlines specific goals, suggests future research directions, and sketches prospects for designing efficient and high&#8208;performing ZIBs. It aims at bridging the gap from academia to industry for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with the High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel halide solid electrolyte, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, is reported. The cation&#8208;anion radius ratio is found to be a pivotal factor in determining whether the anion sublattice will form cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) lattices in the halide Li3MX6 family. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.







Abstract
The Li3MX6 compounds (M=Sc, Y, In; X=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure &#945;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; family. Furthermore, &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MX&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compounds (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Sc, Y, In; &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high-pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;mc&lt;/i&gt; with hexagonal close-packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient-pressure &#945;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MX&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp-to-hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Triply&#8208;Periodic&#8208;Minimal&#8208;Surface Structured Interphase based on Fluorinated Polymers Strengthening High&#8208;energy Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenge of constructing a mechanically robust yet lightweight artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on lithium (Li) anodes highlights a trade&#8208;off between high battery safety and high energy density. Inspired by the intricate microstructure of the white sea urchin, we first develop a polyvinyl fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) interfacial layer with a triple periodic minimal surface structure (TPMS) that could offer maximal modulus with minimal weight. This design endows high mechanical strength to an ordered porous structure, effectively reduces local current density, polarization, and internal resistance, and stabilizes the anode interface. At a low N/P ratio of ~ 3, using LiFePO4 as the cathode, Li anodes protected by TPMS&#8208;structured PVDF&#8208;HFP achieve an extremely low capacity&#8208;fading&#8208;rate of approximately 0.002% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1 C, with an average discharge capacity of 142 mAh g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the TPMS porous structure saves 50 wt.% of the interfacial layer mass, thereby enhancing the energy density of the battery. The TPMS structure is conducive to large&#8208;scale additive manufacturing, which will provide a reference for the future development of lightweight, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density secondary batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal Oxidation Electrochemiluminescence Mechanism of Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks via Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) efficiency is determined by charge transfer between coreactants and emitters in coreactant systems, which are usually limited by their slow intermolecular charge transfer. In this study, a covalent organic framework (COF) with aldehyde residue was synthesized, and then coreactants were covalently integrated into the skeleton through the post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy, resulting in a crystalline coreactant&#8208;embedded COF nanoemitter (C&#8208;COF). Compared to the pristine COF with an equivalent external coreactant, C&#8208;COF exhibited an extraordinary 1008&#8208;fold enhancement of ECL intensity due to the rapid intrareticular charge transfer. Significantly, with the pH increase, C&#8208;COF shows protonation&#8208;induced ECL enhancement for the first ECL peaked at +1.1 V and an opposite trend for the second ECL at +1.4 V, which were attributed to the antedating oxidation of coreactant in framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation, respectively. The resulting bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism was rationalized by spectral characterization and density functional theory calculations. The postsynthetic coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitters present innovative and universal avenues for advancing ECL systems.</dc:description>

         <title>MoS2 Hollow Multishelled Nanospheres Doped Fe Single Atoms Capable of Fast Phase Transformation for Fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple&#8208;shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g&#8208;1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g&#8208;1, which is superior to previously&#8208;reported results. Even at 5 A g&#8208;1, 259.4 mAh g&#8208;1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other &#8220;fast&#8208;charging&#8221; high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing and Regulating Dynamic Evolution of Interfacial Electrolyte Configuration during De&#8208;solvation Process on Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acting as a passive protective layer, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the Li&#8208;metal anode. Derived from the reductive decomposition of electrolytes (e.g., anion and solvent), the SEI construction presents as an interfacial process accompanied by the dynamic de&#8208;solvation process during Li&#8208;metal plating. However, typical electrolyte engineering and related SEI modification strategies always ignore the dynamic evolution of electrolyte configuration at the Li/electrolyte interface, which essentially determines the SEI architecture. Herein, by employing advanced electrochemical in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR and MRI technologies, we directly visualize the dynamic variations of solvation environments involving Li+&#8208;solvent/anion. Remarkably, a weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interaction and anion&#8208;lean interfacial electrolyte configuration have been synchronously revealed, which is difficult for the fabrication of anion&#8208;derived SEI layer. Moreover, as a simple electrochemical regulation strategy, pulse protocol was introduced to effectively restore the interfacial anion concentration, resulting in an enhanced LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer and improved Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Enabled Cycloaddition of Bicyclobutanes with Isocyanides for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has emerged as an important research topic in modern drug development because they can serve as saturated bioisosters to enhance the physicochemical properties and metabolic profiles of drug candidates. Here we report a remarkably simple silver&#8208;enabled strategy to access polysubstituted 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single operation from readily accessible bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and isocyanides. The process is proposed to involve a formal [3+3]/[3+2]/retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition sequence. This novel protocol allows for rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials, and the products can be easily derivatized, further enriching the BCB cycloaddition chemistry and the growing set of valuable sp3&#8208;rich bicyclic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(benzoselenadiazol)ethane: A &#960;&#8208;Extended Acceptor&#8208;Dimeric Unit for Ambipolar Polymer Transistors with Hole and Electron Mobilities Exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of ambipolar polymers with balanced hole (&#956;h) and electron mobilities (&#956;e) &gt;10 cm2 V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is the main bottleneck for developing organic integrated circuits. Herein, we show the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended selenium&#8208;containing acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethane (BBSeE), to address this dilemma. In comparison to its sulfur&#8208;counterpart, BBSeE demonstrates deeper frontier molecular orbital levels and stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. The successful stannylation of BBSeE offers a great opportunity to access acceptor&#8208;acceptor copolymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, which shows a narrower band gap, lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (&#8722;4.05 eV), and a higher degree of backbone planarity. Consequently, the pN&#8208;BBSeE&#8208;based organic transistors display an ideally balanced ambipolar transport with &#956;h and &#956;e of 10.08 and 10.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous &#956;h /&#956;e values &gt;10.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are the best performances ever reported for ambipolar polymers. In addition, pN&#8208;BBSeE shows an excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability, retaining over 85% of the initial mobility values after two months storage. Our study demonstrates the &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric BBSeE is a promising acceptor building block for constructing high&#8208;performance ambipolar polymers applied in next&#8208;generation organic integrated circuit.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nonbenzenoid Heteroacene Crystals Synthesized via In&#8208;Situ Embedding of Ladder Bipyrazinylenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals are synthesized via the in&#8208;situ embedding of ladder bipyrazinylenes (LBPys) on Au(111). Through the intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and give rise to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Precisely introducing topological defects is an important strategy in nanographene crystal engineering because defects can tune &#960;&#8208;electronic structures and control molecular assemblies. The synergistic control of the synthesis and assembly of nanographenes by embedding the topological defects to afford two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals on surfaces is still a great challenge. By in&#8208;situ embedding ladder bipyrazinylene (LBPy) into acene, the narrowest nanographene with zigzag edges, we have achieved the precise preparation of 2D nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals on Au(111). Through intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and lead to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds. Using bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we determined the atomic structures of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene product and diverse organometallic intermediates. The tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed the electronic structure of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed distinct organometallic intermediates during progression annealing combined with DFT calculations demonstrated that LBPy formation proceeds via electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides, trapping of heteroarynes by Au adatoms, and stepwise elimination of Au adatoms.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hexa&#8208;Substituted Carpyridines into 1D Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recently introduced saddle&#8208;shaped supramolecular unit &#8220;carpyridine&#8221;, which strongly relies on aromatic curvature to self&#8208;assemble, was engineered to form 1D supramolecular polymers. This modified mode of assembly allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the process, including enthalpy values comparable to those of hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems. The minimalism of the molecular design showcases the versatility of curvature in molecular design.







Abstract
The extent of the influence that molecular curvature plays on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymers remains an open question in the field. We began addressing this fundamental question with the introduction of &#8220;carpyridines&#8221;, which are saddle&#8208;shaped monomers that can associate with one another through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and in which the rotational and translational movements are restricted. The topography displayed by the monomers led, previously, to the assembly of highly ordered 2D materials even in the absence of strong directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to gain control over the dimensionality of the formed structures yielding classical unidimensional polymers. These have been characterized using well&#8208;established protocols allowing us to determine and confirm the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of both fibers and sheets. The calculated interaction energies are significantly higher than expected for flexible self&#8208;assembling units lacking classical &#8220;strong&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions. The versatility of this supramolecular unit to assemble into either supramolecular fibers or 2D sheets with strong association energies highlights remarkably well the potential and importance of molecular shape for the design of supramolecular materials and the applications thereof.

         <dc:description>
Two simple structure and highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks (CNPz and DCNPz) were synthesized and incorporated into polymer backbone. P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show unipolar electron mobilities of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in OTFTs, respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, these two polymers exhibit electrical conductivities and power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is essential to accelerate the application of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). To achieve this objective, it is critical to design strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthesis, which are essential for the development of n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Herein, we synthesized two cyano&#8208;functionalized highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 3,6&#8208;dibromopyrazine&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitrile (CNPz) and 3,6&#8208;Dibromopyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile (DCNPz), which feature simple structures and facile synthesis. CNPz and DCNPz can be obtained via only one&#8208;step reaction and three&#8208;step reactions from cheap raw materials, respectively. Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) polymers, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is obtained for P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz), respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show high n&#8208;type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, respectively. Hence, the cyano&#8208;functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low&#8208;cost and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient building block for constructing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

Hence, the cyano-functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low-cost and readily accessible electron-deficient building block for constructing n-type polymer semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolving the Origins of Superior Cycling Performance of Antimony Anode in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Comparison with Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic comparative study on the electrochemical performance and dynamic microstructural and mechanical changes of antimony anode in storing Li+/Na+ cations was carried out by combining in situ microscopic and spectroscopic analysis, density functional theory simulations, and finite&#8208;element analysis. Full stepwise crystal transition with large lattice strains has been witnessed in Li&#8208;storage system, while an unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/de&#8208;alloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as intermediates is discovered in Na&#8208;storage system, featuring enhanced resilience and less strain, contributing to high capacities and superior cyclability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02&#8197;&#197;) than Li+ (0.76&#8197;&#197;), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to the lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na&#8722;Sb alloys than Li&#8722;Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large&#8208;volume&#8208;change electrode materials.

         <title>Co&#8208;aggregation as A Simple Strategy for Preparing Fluorogenic Tetrazine Probes with On&#8208;Demand Fluorogen Selection
</title>

         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;aggregation of tetrazine molecules and fluorophores serves as a simple, fast, and convenient strategy for preparing fluorogenic nanoprobes. The obtained coaggregates show bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity with a broad selection of emission spectra. This report highlights the molecular design principles and detailed protocols for achieving this &#8220;just mix&#8221; approach.







Abstract
Life science has progressed with applications of fluorescent probes&#8212;fluorophores linked to functional units responding to biological events. To meet the varied demands across experiments, simple organic reactions to connect fluorophores and functional units have been developed, enabling the on&#8208;demand selection of fluorophore&#8208;functional unit combinations. However, organic synthesis requires professional equipment and skills, standing as a daunting task for life scientists. In this study, we present a simple, fast, and convenient strategy for probe preparation: co&#8208;aggregation of hydrophobic molecules. We focused on tetrazine&#8212;a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare yet useful functional unit that provides effective bioorthogonal reactivity and strong fluorogenicity. Simply mixing the tetrazine molecules and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens in water, co&#8208;aggregation is induced, and the emission of AIE luminogens is quenched. Subsequent click reaction bioorthogonally turns on the emission, identifying these coaggregates as fluorogenic probes. Thanks to this bioorthogonal fluorogenicity, we established a new time&#8208;gated fluorescence bioimaging technique to distinguish overlapping emission signals, enabling multi&#8208;organelle imaging with two same&#8208;color fluorophores. Our study showcases the potential of this co&#8208;aggregation method for the on&#8208;demand preparation of fluorescent probes as well as protocols and molecular design principles in this approach, offering an effective solution to evolving needs in life science research.

         <title>Transcytosis&#8208;Based Renal Tubular Reabsorption of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a smart surface mimic strategy for exogenous ultrasmall gold nanoparticles to construct protein mimics (P&#8722;AuNPs) and demonstrated that the P&#8722;AuNPs were identical to the endogenous filterable proteins not only in appearance but also in transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption. This surface&#8208;mimicking strategy can stimulate further investigation into many other endogenous metabolic pathways for exogenous substances.







Abstract
Transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of endogenous proteins is a well&#8208;known energy&#8208;saving pathway that prevents nutrient loss. However, utilization of this well&#8208;known reabsorption pathway for the delivery of exogenous nanodrugs remains a challenge. In this study, using the surface mimic strategy of a specific PEPT1/2&#8208;targeted Gly&#8722;Sar peptide as a ligand, renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (P&#8722;AuNPs) were developed as protein mimics to investigate the transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of exogenous substances. By regulating the influential factors (H+ content in tubular lumens and PEPT1/2 transporter counts in tubular cells) of Gly&#8722;Sar&#8208;mediated transcytosis, the specific and efficient interaction between P&#8722;AuNPs and renal tubular cells was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Efficient transcellular transportation significantly guided the reabsorption of P&#8722;AuNPs back into the bloodstream, which enhanced the blood concentration and bioavailability of nanoparticles, contributing to high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging.

         <title>Enhanced Charge Carrier Dynamics on Sb2Se3 Photocathodes for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photoelectrochemical ammonia production from NO3 reduction reaction can be achieved by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency of 88.01&#8201;% and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;VRHE. It provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is recognized as a transportable carrier for renewable energy fuels. Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) offers a sustainable solution for nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater treatment by directly converting solar energy to ammonia. In this study, we demonstrate the highly selective PEC ammonia production from NO3RR by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The constructed CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) of 88.01&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;VRHE and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;VRHE with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;VRHE. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode possesses high light absorption capacity, excellent carrier transfer capability, and high charge separation and transfer efficiencies. The photocathode can effectively adsorb the reactant NO3&#8722; and intermediate, and the CoCu co&#8208;catalyst increases the maximum Gibbs free energy difference between NO3RR and HER. Meanwhile, the Co species enhances the spin density of Cu, and increases the density of states near the Fermi level in pdos, which results in a high PEC NO3RR activity on CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3. This work provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

The constructed CoCu/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) of 88.01&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the CoCu/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathode possesses high light absorption capacity, excellent carrier transfer capability, and high charge separation and transfer efficiencies. The photocathode can effectively adsorb the reactant NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and intermediate, and the CoCu co-catalyst increases the maximum Gibbs free energy difference between NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR and HER. Meanwhile, the Co species enhances the spin density of Cu, and increases the density of states near the Fermi level in pdos, which results in a high PEC NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity on CoCu/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This work provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate-rich wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Consumer Grade Polyethylene Recycling via Hydrogenolysis on Ultrafine Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium particles of &#8764;1&#8197;nm supported on titania achieved via hydrogenolysis up to 80&#8201;% conversion of HDPE used in bottle caps into light alkanes at mild conditions and showed reusability. General selectivity trends were disclosed across HDPE types. Isomerization cedes to backbone scission as reaction progresses, nuanced by HDPE type.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenolysis has the potential to convert high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), which comprises about 30&#8201;% of plastic waste, into valuable alkanes. Most investigations have focused on increasing activity for lab grade HDPEs displaying low molecular weight, with limited mechanistic understanding of the product distribution. No efficient catalyst is available for consumer grades due to their lower reactivity. This study targets HDPE used in bottle caps, a waste form generated globally at a rate of approximately one million units per hour. Ultrafine ruthenium particles (1&#8197;nm) supported on titania (anatase) achieved up to 80&#8201;% conversion into light alkanes (C1&#8722;C45) under mild conditions (498&#8197;K, 20&#8197;bar H2, 4&#8197;h) and were reused for three cycles. Small ruthenium nanoparticles were critical to achieving relevant conversions, as activity sharply decreased with particle size. Selectivity commonalities and peculiarities across HDPE grades were disclosed by a reaction modelling approach applied to products. Isomerization cedes to backbone scission as the reaction progresses. Within this trend, low molecular weight favor isomerization whilst high molecular weight favor cleavage. Commercial caps obeyed this trend with decreased activity, anticipating the influence of additives in realistic processing. This study demonstrates effective hydrogenolysis of consumer grade polyethylene and provides selectivity patterns for product control.

         <title>Synthetic Biology&#8208;based Construction of Unnatural Perylenequinones with Improved Photodynamic Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unnatural perylenequinone cercosporin A is obtained by reprogramming cercosporin assembly line in Cercospora, which displays low dark toxicity and high photostability and maintains great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it shows selective accumulation in cancer cells. Thus, this work provides a remarkable concept for preparing unnatural products with the desired functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies.







Abstract
The construction of structural complexity and diversity of natural products is crucial for drug discovery and development. To overcome high dark toxicity and poor photostability of natural photosensitizer perylenequinones (PQs) for photodynamic therapy, herein, we aim to introduce the structural complexity and diversity to biosynthesize the desired unnatural PQs in fungus Cercospora through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategy. Thus, we first elucidate the intricate biosynthetic pathways of class B PQs and reveal how the branching enzymes create their structural complexity and diversity from a common ancestor. This enables the rational reprogramming of cercosporin biosynthetic pathway in Cercospora to generate diverse unnatural PQs without chemical modification. Among them, unnatural cercosporin A displays remarkably low dark toxicity and high photostability with retention of great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it is found that, unlike cercosporin, unnatural cercosporin A could be selectively accumulated in cancer cells, providing potential targets for drug development. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for preparing unnatural products with customized functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies, thus facilitating drug discovery pipelines from nature.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion through Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological phase transition, mediated by oxygen vacancies, is discovered in free&#8208;standing Ni&#8208;Co oxides supported on graphene aerogel. This phase transition introduces NiCoO2/NiCo2O4 heterojunction in the surface region, thus improving the catalytic activity thanks to a strong internal electric field and gradient oxygen vacancies. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 and desorption of *CO intermediates, resulting in an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Weak adsorption of gas reactants and strong binding of intermediates present a significant challenge for most transition metal oxides, particularly in the realm of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we demonstrate that the adsorption can be fine&#8208;tuned by phase engineering of oxide catalysts. An oxygen vacancy mediated topological phase transition in Ni&#8208;Co oxide nanowires, supported on a hierarchical graphene aerogel (GA), is observed from a spinel phase to a rock&#8208;salt phase. Such in situ phase transition empowers the Ni&#8208;Co oxide catalyst with a strong internal electric field and the attainment of abundant oxygen vacancies. Among a series of catalysts, the in situ transformed spinel/rock&#8208;salt heterojunction supported on GA stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, yielding an impressive CO production rate of 12.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 96.5&#8201;%. This remarkable performance is a result of the robust interfacial coupling between two topological phases that optimizes the electronic structures through directional charge transfer across interfaces. The phase transition process induces more Co2+ in octahedral site, which can effectively enhance the Co&#8208;O covalency. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 molecules and desorption of reaction intermediates, thereby lowering the energetic barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Identification of Direct Anchoring Sites for Monoatomic Dispersion of Precious Metals (Pt, Pd, Ag) on CeO2 Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface of the reducible support (CeO2), rather than the defects on the surface, are the direct anchoring sites of active metals. Therefore, active metals (Ag, Pt and Pd, etc.) can be single&#8208;atom dispersed on the terminal hydroxyl&#8208;rich CeO2&#8722;NC support (CeO2 (100) surfaces).







Abstract
Monoatomic dispersion of precious metals on the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals is a highly practical approach for dramatically reducing the usage of precious metals while exploiting the unique properties of single&#8208;atom catalysts. However, the specific atomic sites for anchoring precious metal atoms on the CeO2 support and underlying chemical mechanism remain partially unknown. Herein, we show that the terminal hydroxyls on the (100) surface are the most stable sites for anchoring Ag atoms on CeO2, indicating that CeO2 nanocubes are the most efficient substrates to achieve monoatomic dispersion of Ag. Importantly, the newly identified chemical mechanism for single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom dispersion on CeO2 nanocubes appears to be generic and can thus be extended to other precious metals (Pt and Pd). In fact, our experiments also show that atomically dispersed Pt/Pd species exhibit morphology&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent CO selectivity in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Chemiluminophore for High&#8208;Contrast Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

mMB, as a novel self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecule enabling photon sensitization, chemical defect formation, and afterglow generation, possessed a NIR afterglow chemiluminescence with a higher brightness and a NIR fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic signal. By introducing a responsive unit on the phenothiazine ring, it was tailored for ultrasensitive imaging of biomarkers with a superior activation ratio, enabling in vivo versatile imaging with high SBRs.







Abstract
Afterglow imaging holds great promise for ultrasensitive bioimaging due to its elimination of autofluorescence. Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs), which enable all&#8208;in&#8208;one photon sensitization, chemical defect formation and afterglow generation, possess a simplified, reproducible, and efficient superiority over commonly used multi&#8208;component systems. However, there is a lack of SAMs, particularly those with much brighter near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and structural flexibility for building high&#8208;contrast activatable imaging probes. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports a methylene blue derivative&#8208;based self&#8208;sustaining afterglow agent (SAN&#8208;M) with brighter NIR afterglow chemiluminescence peaking at 710&#8197;nm. By leveraging the structural flexibility and tunability, an activatable nanoprobe (SAN&#8208;MO) is customized for simultaneously activatable fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic and afterglow imaging of peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;), notably with a superior activation ratio of 4523 in the afterglow mode, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than other reported activatable afterglow systems. By virtue of the elimination of autofluorescence and ultrahigh activation contrast, SAN&#8208;MO enables early monitoring of the LPS&#8208;induced acute inflammatory response within 30&#8197;min upon LPS stimulation and precise image&#8208;guided resection of tiny metastatic tumors, which is unattainable for fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Ultrastrong Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Uranium&#8208;Organic Frameworks Leading to Inverse Luminescence Temperature Dependence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consistent, crystalline, and oriented uranium&#8208;based MOF thin film was devised by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique. The materials exhibited a noticeable phonon&#8208;assisted temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and presented two unusual thermal&#8208;activated emission bands (&#8220;hot&#8208;band&#8221;). A single&#8208;metal ratiometric optical thermometer was designed relying on this uranium&#8208;based MOF thin films and it exhibited exceptional thermal sensitivity.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;phonon interactions, crucial in condensed matter, are rarely seen in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Detecting these interactions typically involves analyzing luminescence in lanthanide&#8208; or actinide&#8208;based compounds. Prior studies on Ln&#8208; and Ac&#8208;based MOFs at high temperatures revealed additional peaks, but these were too faint for thorough analysis. In our research, we fabricated a high&#8208;quality, crystalline uranium&#8208;based MOF (KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1) thin film using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. Under UV light, this film showed two distinct &#8220;hot bands,&#8221; indicating a strong electron&#8208;phonon interaction. At 77&#8197;K, these bands were absent, but at 300&#8197;K, a new emission band appeared with half the intensity of the main luminescence. Surprisingly, a second hot band emerged above 320&#8197;K, deviating from previous findings in rare&#8208;earth compounds. We conducted a detailed ab&#8208;initio analysis employing time&#8208;dependent density functional theory to understand this unusual behaviour and to identify the lattice vibration responsible for the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1 film's hot&#8208;band emission was then utilized to create a highly sensitive, single&#8208;compound optical thermometer. This underscores the potential of high&#8208;quality MOF thin films in exploiting the unique luminescence of lanthanides and actinides for advanced applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystallinity Mismatch Between Donor and Acceptor to Improve Exciton/Charge Transport in Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4&#8208;C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.







Abstract
Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap&#8208;assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Hence, a facile strategy is proposed to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor by incorporating a novel multifunctional liquid crystal small molecule (LCSM) BDTPF4&#8208;C6 into the binary blend. BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is the first LCSM based on a tetrafluorobenzene unit and features a low liquid crystal phase transition temperature and strong self&#8208;assembly ability, conducive to regulating the active layer morphology. When BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is introduced as a guest molecule into the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 binary, it exhibits better compatibility with the donor PM6 and primarily resides within the PM6 phase because of the similarity&#8208;intermiscibility principle. Moreover, systematic studies revealed that BDTPF4&#8208;C6 could be used as a seeding agent for PM6 to enhance its crystallinity, thereby forming a more balanced and favourable charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was observed between the guest molecule and the host donor and acceptor, resulting in an improved current density. This study demonstrates a facile approach to balance the charge mobilities and offers new insights into boosting the efficiency of single&#8208;junction OSCs beyond 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reaction&#8208;Enabled Chloride Modification on CsPbI3 Quantum Dots for Pure Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 26&#8201;%</title>

Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with a carrier&#8208;confined structure of CsPbI3/PbClx are demonstrated via the nucleophilic reaction during colloidal synthesis. The modification of a PbClx surface outside the CsPbI3 QDs regulates the exciton recombination, enabling high&#8208;performance pure red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, and superior operation stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance pure red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an emission wavelength shorter than 650&#8197;nm are ideal for wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays, yet remain an unprecedented challenge to progress. Mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Br/I)3 emitter&#8208;based PeLEDs suffer spectral stability induced by halide phase segregation and CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) suffer from a compromise between emission wavelength and electroluminescence efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient pure red PeLEDs with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs. A nucleophilic reaction that releases chloride ions and manipulates the ligand equilibrium of the colloidal system is developed to synthesize the pure red emission QDs. The comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterizations evidence the formation of PbClx outside the CsPbI3 QDs, which regulates exciton recombination and prevents the exciton from dissociation induced by surface defects. In consequence, PeLEDs based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs with superior optoelectronic properties demonstrate stable electroluminescence spectra at high driving voltages, a record external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, optimal efficiency roll&#8208;off of 16.0&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and a half lifetime of 7.5&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs. This work provides new insight into constructing the carrier&#8208;confined structure on perovskite QDs for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Sulfonated Perylene as Three&#8208;in&#8208;One STING Agonist for Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study states that sulfonated perylene can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist that not only promotes the production of endogenous cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) but also inhibits its hydrolysis as well as achieves lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and hence presents an innovative platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) has been considered as a powerful immunotherapy strategy. While promising, the clinical translation of CDNs is still overwhelmed by its limited biostability and the resulting systemic immunotoxicity. Being differentiating from current application of exogenous CDNs to address these challenges, we herein developed one perylene STING agonist PDIC&#8208;NS, which not only promotes the production of endogenous CDNs but also inhibits its hydrolysis. More significantly, PDIC&#8208;NS can well reach lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and thus mitigates the systemic immunotoxicity upon intravenous administration. As a result, PDIC&#8208;NS had realized remarkable in vivo antitumor activity, and backward verified on STING knock out mice. Overall, this study states that PDIC&#8208;NS can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecule STING agonist characterized by promoting the content and biostability of endogenous CDNs as well as possessing good tissue specificity, and hence presents an innovative strategy and platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Shuttling in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;nanometer long iridium&#8208;cornered metallorectangle was obtained and used for the encapsulation of a wide variety of planar guests. This slit&#8208;shaped metallobox is able to form host&#8211;guest complexes with a variety of planar molecules, which slide from one side of the cavity to the other, with a large amplitude motion that was experimentally quantified.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;conjoined long and narrow metallorectangle was obtained by combining a quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine&#8208;connected Janus&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene ligand and pyrazine. The size and shape of this assembly together with the fused polyaromatic nature of its panels provides it with properties that are uncommon for other metallosupramolecular assemblies. For example, this nanosized &#8216;slit&#8208;like&#8217; metallobox is able show very large binding affinities with planar organic molecules in such a way, that the cavity is asymmetrically occupied by the guest molecule. This unsymmetrical conformation leads to the existence of a large amplitude motion of these guests, which slide between the two sides of the cavity of the host, thus constituting rare examples of molecular shuttles.

         <title>Ground&#8208;State Orbital Descriptors for Accelerated Development of Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work built a machine learning&#8208;aided classifier for phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;p) based on ground&#8208;state orbital descriptors derived from &#960;&#8208;electron in the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), balancing screening efficiency and accuracy of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. With the aid of excited&#8208;state calculations, 287 RTP candidates were screened from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules.







Abstract
Organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are in high demand for optoelectronics and bioelectronics. Developing RTP materials highly relies on expert experience and costly excited&#8208;state calculations. It is a challenge to find a tool for effectively screening RTP materials. Herein we first establish ground&#8208;state orbital descriptors (&#960;FMOs) derived from the &#960;&#8208;electron component of the frontier molecular orbitals to characterize the RTP lifetime (&#964;p), achieving a balance in screening efficiency and accuracy. Using the &#960;FMOs, a data&#8208;driven machine learning model gains a high accuracy in classifying long &#964;p, filtering out 836 candidates with long&#8208;lived RTP from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules. With the aid of the excited&#8208;state calculations, 287 compounds are predicted with high RTP efficiency. Impressively, experiments further confirm the reliability of this workflow, opening a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance RTP materials for potential applications.

         <title>Initiating a High&#8208;Rate and Stable Aqueous Air Battery by Using Organic N&#8208;Heterocycle Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a strategy of organic&#8208;air batteries which is assembled with organic material as anode directly instead of the traditional metal&#8208;air batteries. Organic N&#8208;heterocycle compounds (NHCC) were synthesized and used as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept anode materials, which exhibits a low redox potential of &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO. Coupling with a 4&#8197;M KOH+10&#8197;M KCF3SO3 electrolyte, the NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries exhibited a high voltage of 1.6&#8197;V and life time of 30,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Alkaline metal&#8208;air batteries are advantageous in high voltage, low cost, and high safety. However, metal anodes are heavily eroded in strong alkaline electrolytes, causing serious side reactions including dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolution. To address this limitation, we successfully synthesized an organic N&#8208;heterocycle compound (NHCC) to serve as an alternative anode. This compound not only exhibits remarkable stability but also possesses a low redox potential (&#8722;1.04&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline environments. To effectively complement the low redox potential of the NHCC anode, we designed a dual&#8208;salt highly concentrated electrolyte (4.0&#8197;M KOH+10.0&#8197;M KCF3SO3). This electrolyte expands the electrochemical stability window to 2.3&#8197;V through the robust interaction between the O atom in H2O molecule with the K+ of KCF3SO3 (H&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;KCF3SO3). We further demonstrated the K+ uptaken/extraction storage mechanism of NHCC anodes. Consequently, the alkaline aqueous NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries delivers a high battery voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, high&#8208;rate performance (101.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle ability (30,000&#8197;cycles). Our work offers a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic anode materials and develops a novel double superconcentrated conductive salt electrolyte for the construction of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle alkaline aqueous organic anode&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Toward Simultaneous Dense Zinc Deposition and Broken Side&#8208;Reaction Loops in the Zn//V2O5 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

A rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) was developed to achieve dense zinc deposition and broken side&#8208;reaction loops in the Zn//V2O5 system simultaneously.







Abstract
The Zn//V2O5 system not only faces the incontrollable growth of zinc (Zn) dendrites, but also withstands the cross&#8208;talk effect of by&#8208;products produced from the cathode side to the Zn anode, inducing interelectrode talk and aggravating battery failure. To tackle these issues, we construct a rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) to achieve Zn deposition modulation and side reaction inhibition in Zn//V2O5 full cells. The polymer matrix and BN exhibit a robust anchoring effect on SO42&#8722;, accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling dense Zn deposition behavior. Therefore, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells based on the R&#8208;ZSO electrolyte can operate stably for more than 1500&#8197;h, which is six times higher than that of cells employing the blank electrolyte. More importantly, the R&#8208;ZSO hydrogel electrolyte effectively decouples the cross&#8208;talk effects, thus breaking the infinite loop of side reactions. As a result, the Zn//V2O5 cells using this modified hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate stable operation over 1,000&#8197;cycles, with a capacity loss rate of only 0.028&#8201;% per cycle. Our study provides a promising gel chemistry, which offers a valuable guide for the construction of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported a novel molecular strategy to optimize commercial hard carbon (HC). A disodium phthalate (DP) molecule with two Na+ is capable of efficiently replenishing the Na+ loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) generation. The as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (&#8776;7.4&#8197;nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8&#8201;%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.3&#8201;% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.

         <title>Unearthing Superior Inorganic UV Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Materials: A Mineral&#8208;Inspired Method Integrating First&#8208;Principles High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking fresnoite&#8208;type solar&#8208;blind UV nonlinear material, Rb2SbFP2O7, with a shortened UV absorption edge, heightened birefringence, and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response, was successfully designed and synthesized through a mineral&#8208;inspired approach integrating first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering.







Abstract
Natural minerals, with their adaptable framework structures exemplified by perovskite and lyonsite, have sparked substantial interest as potential templates for the design of advanced functional solid&#8208;state materials. Nonetheless, the quest for new materials with desired properties remains a substantial challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective and practical synthetic approaches. In this study, we have harnessed a synergistic approach that seamlessly integrates first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering to reinvigorate the often&#8208;overlooked fresnoite mineral, Ba2TiOSi2O7. This innovative strategy has culminated in the successful synthesis of two superior inorganic UV nonlinear optical materials, namely Rb2TeOP2O7 and Rb2SbFP2O7. Notably, Rb2SbFP2O7 demonstrates a comprehensive enhancement in nonlinear optical performance, featuring a shortened UV absorption edge (260&#8197;nm) and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.1&#215;KDP). Particularly striking is its significantly increased birefringence (0.15@546&#8197;nm), which is approximately 30 times higher than the prototype Ba2TiOSi2O7 (0.005@546&#8197;nm). Our research has not only revitalized the potential of the fresnoite mineral for the development of new high&#8208;performance UV nonlinear optical materials but has also provided a clearly defined roadmap for the efficient exploration of novel structure&#8208;driven functional materials with targeted properties.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Formaldehyde&#8208;Nitrate Batteries for Wastewater Refining, Electricity Generation, and Production of Ammonia and Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel multi&#8208;functional formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery, which simultaneously realizes wastewater purification, electricity generation and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NH3 and formate. This battery exhibits an open&#8208;circuit potential of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For simulated industrial wastewater, 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed and an electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated.







Abstract
As bulky pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater, nitrate and formaldehyde pose serious threats to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies including chemical and bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;chemical methods, are generally high&#8208;cost, time&#8208;consuming, or energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report a novel formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery by pairing anodic formaldehyde oxidation with cathodic nitrate reduction, which simultaneously enables wastewater purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia and formate. As a result, the formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery remarkably exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the yield rates of 32.7&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ammonia and 889.4&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formate. In a large&#8208;scale formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery (25&#8197;cm2), 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed from simulated industrial wastewater and the electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated. Moreover, the design of such a multi&#8208;functional battery is universally applicable to the coupling of NO3&#8722; or NO2&#8722; reduction with various aldehyde oxidization, paving a new avenue for wastewater purification and chemical manufacturing.

         <title>For Zinc Metal Batteries, How Many Electrons go to Hydrogen Evolution? An Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

This study introduces an innovative in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry method for precise quantification of hydrogen evolution reactions during zinc electrodeposition. The results show that the magnitude of hydrogen evolution is positively correlated to applied current density.







Abstract
Despite the advantages of aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries (AZMB) like high specific capacity (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 5,854&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), low redox potential (&#8722;0.76&#8197;V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), low cost, water compatibility, and safety, the development of practically relevant batteries is plagued by several issues like unwanted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion of Zn substrate (insulating ZnO, Zn(OH)2, Zn(SO4)x(OH)y, Zn(ClO4)x(OH)y etc. passivation layer), and dendrite growth. Controlling and suppressing HER activity strongly correlates with the long&#8208;term cyclability of AZMBs. Therefore, a precise quantitative technique is needed to monitor the real&#8208;time dynamics of hydrogen evolution during Zn electrodeposition. In this study, we quantify hydrogen evolution using in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS). This methodology enables us to determine a correction factor for the faradaic efficiency of this system with unmatched precision. For instance, during the electrodeposition of zinc on a copper substrate at a current density of 1.5&#8197;mA/cm2 for 600&#8197;seconds, 0.3&#8201;% of the total charge is attributed to HER, while the rest contributes to zinc electrodeposition. At first glance, this may seem like a small fraction, but it can be detrimental to the long&#8208;term cycling performance of AZMBs. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the correlation between HER and the porous morphology of the electrodeposited zinc, unravelling the presence of trapped H2 and Zn corrosion during the charging process. Overall, this study sets a platform to accurately determine the faradaic efficiency of Zn electrodeposition and provides a powerful tool for evaluating electrolyte additives, salts, and electrode modifications aimed at enhancing long&#8208;term stability and suppressing the HER in aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to nanozymes mimicking specific metallocofactors without other supporting cofactors, a metal&#8211;organic framework incorporating multiple nanocofactors demonstrates the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The synergy of the atomic iron sites, linkers and zirconia nodes boosts electron transfer, providing insight into the construction of catalytic pockets at the atomic scale for a deep understanding of nanozyme catalysis.







Abstract
Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.

         <title>Asymmetric Anion Zinc Salt Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel zinc salt (Zn(DFTFSI)2) with an asymmetric structure anion group DFTFSI&#8722;, to enable a high ionic conductivity and engender in situ formation of a robust layer&#8208;structured SEI layer via easy decomposition of the asymmetric DFTFSI&#8722;. This robust SEI layer can quickly transfer Zn2+ ions, restrain dendrite growth, and suppress over 90&#8201;% hydrogen production, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.







Abstract
Organic additives with high&#8208;reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low&#8208;concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&#8208;)&#8208;based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&#8722; in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer&#8208;structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn
Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &gt;2500&#8197;h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn
Br2 battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200&#8197;cycles at ~99.8&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn
Br2 battery (~5.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8208;2), cycling over 320&#8197;cycles with 95.3&#8201;% initial capacity retained.

         <title>Identification of Cu(111) as Superior Active Sites for Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3 with High Single&#8208;Pass Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visual demonstration of the s&#8208;p and d&#8208;p hybridization states between Cu and N atom in N&#8722;O during the adsorption and activation mechanism of NO molecules is brought. The &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* coordination bond&#8221; formed between N atom and Cu center is the essence of the interaction between the Cu center and NO molecule. The Cu3d electrons occupy the &#960;* orbitals in NO, eventually weakening the N&#8801;O triple bond.







Abstract
Opting for NO as an N source in electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis presents an intriguing approach to tackle energy and environmental challenges. However, blindly pursuing high NH3 synthesis rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE) while ignoring the NO conversion ratio could result in environmental problems. Herein, Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) surface is fabricated and exhibit a NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 yield rate of 371.89&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (flow cell) and the highest FE of 93.19&#177;1.99&#8201;% (H&#8208;type cell). The NO conversion ratio is increased to the current highest value of 63.74&#8201;% combined with the development of the flow cell. Additionally, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) clearly reveals that the &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; is the essence of the interaction between the Cu and NO as also supported by operando attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IRAS) in observing the key intermediate of NO&#8722;. This work not only achieves a milestone NO conversion ratio for electrocatalytic NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3, but also proposes a new descriptor that utilizes orbital hybridization between molecules and metal centers to accurately identify the real active sites of catalysts.

Additionally, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) clearly reveals that the &#8220;&#963;-&#960;* acceptance-donation&#8221; is the essence of the interaction between the Cu and NO as also supported by operando attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IRAS) in observing the key intermediate of NO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This work not only achieves a milestone NO conversion ratio for electrocatalytic NO-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but also proposes a new descriptor that utilizes orbital hybridization between molecules and metal centers to accurately identify the real active sites of catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;N2 Batteries with Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation and Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

A novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system is established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. Benefiting from the strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities of the Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 cathode, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery displays the highest round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.2&#8201;%) to date, superior rate capability, and stable cycle life of over 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32&#8197;V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (&#8776;500&#8197;h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an innovative operando plasmon&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry technique for the sensitive detection of interfacial species during electrochemical reactions. This platform is established by plasmonic antennae electrically connected via monolayer graphene and exhibits a remarkable signal enhancement. The enhanced IR features enable the reconstruction of electrochemical curves and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
IR spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;IR) is a cutting&#8208;edge operando method for exploring electrochemical reaction mechanisms. However, detection of interfacial molecules is challenged by the limited sensitivity of existing EC&#8208;IR platforms due to the lack of high&#8208;enhancement substrates. Here, we propose an innovative plasmon&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;PEIRS) platform to overcome this sensitivity limitation. Plasmonic antennae with ultrahigh IR signal enhancement are electrically connected via monolayer graphene while preserving optical path integrity, serving as both the electrode and IR substrate. The [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; redox reaction and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are investigated on the EC&#8208;PEIRS platform with a remarkable signal enhancement. Notably, the enhanced IR signals enable a reconstruction of the electrochemical curve of the redox reactions and unveil the CO2RR mechanism. This study presents a promising technique for boosting the in&#8208;depth understanding of interfacial events across diverse applications.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature synthesis of crystalline Sb3N5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline Sb3N5 has been synthesized from the high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature chemical reaction of antimony and nitrogen in a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The Cmc21 structure of Sb3N5, determined by single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, contains two types Sb atoms in octahedral and trigonal prismatic (square antiprismatic) coordination, respectively forming alternated double&#8208; and mono&#8208;layers stacked in the bc plane.







Abstract
A chemical reaction between Sb and N2 was induced under high&#8208;pressure (32&#8211;35&#8197;GPa) and high&#8208;temperature (1600&#8211;2200&#8197;K) conditions, generated by a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The reaction product was identified by single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at 35&#8197;GPa and room temperature as crystalline antimony nitride with Sb3N5 stoichiometry and structure belonging to orthorhombic space group Cmc21. Only Sb&#8722;N bonds are present in the covalent bonding framework, with two types of Sb atoms respectively forming SbN6 distorted octahedra and trigonal prisms and three types of N atoms forming NSb4 distorted tetrahedra and NSb3 trigonal pyramids. Taking into account two longer Sb&#8722;N distances, the SbN6 trigonal prisms can be depicted as SbN8 square antiprisms and the NSb3 trigonal pyramids as NSb4 distorted tetrahedra. The Sb3N5 structure can be described as an ordered stacking in the bc plane of bi&#8208; layers of SbN6 octahedra alternated to monolayers of SbN6 trigonal prisms (SbN8 square antiprisms). The discovery of Sb3N5 finally represents the long sought&#8208;after experimental evidence for Sb to form a crystalline nitride, providing new insights about fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and opening new perspectives for the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of pnictogen nitrides and the synthesis of an entire class of new materials.

         <title>Helitwistacenes&#8212;Combining Lateral and Longitudinal Helicity Results in Solvent&#8208;Induced Inversion of Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining helicenes with twistacenes, in which the extent of twisting can be tuned, has led to the new family of helitwistacenes. The combination of lateral and longitudinal helicity results in polarity&#8208;induced and twisting&#8208;induced sign inversion of both the electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals. This sign inversion could be explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.







Abstract
Helicity is expressed differently in ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;fused acenes&#8212;helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent&#8208;induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.

This sign inversion could be explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helicity is expressed differently in ortho- and para-fused acenes&#8212;helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X-ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent-induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD-DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithiophilic Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Coating for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable polyimide 2D covalent organic framework (COF), which has abundant lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units within the 1D channels. The COF can serve as an intermediate layer to guide the uniform electrodeposition of lithium ion, leading to the formation of dense and smooth lithium deposition layer in a cylindrical morphology and steady lithium plating/stripping behaviors.







Abstract
The growth of disorganized lithium dendrites and weak solid electrolyte interphase greatly impede the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new kind of stable polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have a high density of well&#8208;aligned lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units anchored within the uniform one&#8208;dimensional channels. The COFs can serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, effectively guiding the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. The unsymmetrical Li||COF&#8722;Cu battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which can be well retained up to 400&#8197;cycles. Meanwhile, the Li&#8208;COF||LFP full cell shows a Coulombic efficiency over 99&#8201;% at a charge of 0.3&#8197;C. And its capacity can be well maintained up to 91&#8201;% even after 150&#8197;cycles. Therefore, the significant electrochemical cycling stability illustrates the feasibility of employing COFs in solving the disordered deposition of lithium ions in lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Tip&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Induced Surface Microenvironments Regulation Boosts the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;like FeN4 structures on curved carbon surfaces are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The curved structure induced a strong local electric field and dense interfacial water layer, enhancing the kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. The modulated electronic structures of Fe centers facilitate the ORR pathway transition from an associative to a dissociative process.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts with defined local structures and favorable surface microenvironments are significant for overcoming slow kinetics and accelerating O2 electroreduction. Here, enriched tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites (T&#8722;Fe SAC) on spherical carbon surfaces were developed to investigate the change in surface microenvironments and catalysis behavior. Finite element method (FEM) simulations, together with experiments, indicate the strong local electric field of the tip&#8208;like FeN4 and the more denser interfacial water layer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate the pathway transition on the tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites, promoting the dissociation of O&#8722;O bond via side&#8208;on adsorption model. The adsorbed OH* can be facilely released on the curved surface and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. The obtained T&#8722;Fe SAC nanoreactor exhibits excellent ORR activities (E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability, exceeding those of flat FeN4 and Pt/C. This work clarified the in&#8208;depth insights into the origin of catalytic activity of tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites and held great promise in industrial catalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and many other fields.

         <title>High Mobility Emissive Excimer Organic Semiconductor Towards Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was designed and synthesized. Comprehensive experimental characterizations demonstrated that 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal integrated the properties of high mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a strong excimer emission (PLQY: 47.4&#8201;%). More importantly, color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting transistors were also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices with significant potential superiority in smart displays and optical communications. To realize these various applications, it is urgently needed for color&#8208;tunable emission in OLETs, but remains a great challenge as a result of the difficulty for designing organic semiconductors simultaneously integrating high carrier mobility, strong solid&#8208;state emission, and the ability for potential tunable colors. Herein, a high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was reasonably designed by introducing a rotatable carbon&#8211;carbon single bond connecting two anthracene groups at the 2,7&#8208;sites of fluorene, and the small torsion angles simultaneously guarantee effective conjugation and suppress fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the unique stable dimer arrangement and herringbone packing mode of 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal enables its superior integrated optoelectronic properties with high carrier mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and strong excimer emission with absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 47.4&#8201;%. Furthermore, the voltage&#8208;dependent electrically induced color&#8208;tunable emission from orange to blue was also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal based OLETs for the first time. This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color&#8208;tunable OLETs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Pyrene&#8208;Based 1,4&#8208;Dithiins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral pyrene&#8208;based 1,4&#8208;dithiins with cisoid or transoid connectivity between their cyclopenta[e]pyrene units on the dithiin core was introduced and their chiroptical properties were studied. The presence of one or two cyclopenta[e]pyrene units at the dithiin moiety was found to lead to different chiroptical parameters.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral larger fused aromatic compounds are very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations with a focus on tuning circular dichroism, with respect to the g values, depending on their connectivity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Deep Mineralization of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water resistant S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction is in situ designed. The unique H2O&#8208;resistant AlOOH surface layer is conducive to steering the active species to form the dominant intermediates including benzoic acid and benzaldehyde instead of toxic phenols. These intermediates greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier thus resulting an excellent toluene removal efficiency and a high mineralization rate.







Abstract
Deep mineralization of low concentration toluene (C7H8) is one of the most significant but challenging reactions in photocatalysis. It is generally assumed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) as the main reactive species contribute to the enhanced photoactivity, however, it remains ambiguous at this stage. Herein, a S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction with AlOOH as water resistant surface layer is in situ designed for tuning the free radical species and achieving deep mineralization of C7H8. By employing a combination of in situ DRIFTS and materials characterization techniques, we discover that&#160;the dominant intermediates such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid instead of toxic phenols are formed under the action of holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;). These dominant intermediates turn out to greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier. This study offers new possibilities for rationally tailoring the active species and thus directionally producing dominant intermediates via designing water resistant surface layer.

         <title>Modifying the Oxidative Potentials of Imines in a Dye Loaded Capsule for Photocatalytic Cyclization with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the confinement effect of the host&#8208;dye photocatalytic system to shift the redox potentials of substrate, the isomerization and thermodynamic activation of substrate were achieved, which were followed by a multiphoton excitation enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Modifying redox potential of substrates and intermediates to balance pairs of redox steps are important stages for multistep photosynthesis but faced marked challenges. Through co&#8208;clathration of iridium photosensitizer and imine substrate within one packet of a metal&#8208;organic capsule to shift the redox potentials of substrate, herein, we reported a multiphoton enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings. The cage facilitated a pre&#8208;equilibrium substrate&#8208;involving clathrate that cathodic shifts the oxidation potential of the substrate&#8208;dye&#8208;host ternary complex and configuration inversion of substrate via spatial constraints in the confined space. The new two photon excitation strategy enabled the precise control of the multistep electron transfer between each pair (photosensitizer, substrate and the capsule), endowing the catalytic system proceeding smoothly with an enzymatic fashion. Three kinds of 2&#8208;subsituted (&#8722;OH, &#8722;NH2, and &#8722;SH) imines and N&#8208;aryl enamines all give the corresponding cyclization products efficiently under visible light irradiation, demonstrating the promising of the microenvironment driven thermodynamic activation in the host&#8208;dye&#8208;substrate ternary for synergistic combination of multistep photocatalytic transformations.

A series of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with benzotriazole core&#8208;based fused ring were synthesized by introducing different N&#8208;side chains on the benzotriazole core. The active layers with PM6 as polymer donor and ester side chain SMA BZ&#8208;E31 as acceptor show better phase separation morphology and proper domain size. Finally, The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.33&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side chain engineering plays a vital role in exploring high&#8208;performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs by introducing different N&#8208;substituted alkyl and ester alkyl side chains on benzotriazole (BZ) central unit and aimed to investigate the effect of different ester substitution positions on photovoltaic performances. All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue&#8208;shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain&#8208;based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long&#8208;lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ&#8208;core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of highly&#8208;substituted alkyl vinyl ethers in a well&#8208;defined configuration is challenging. Now, a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) enabled by dual&#8208;functional Cu catalysis is reported. It also represents a novel ring&#8208;opening pattern involving the cleavage of the C1&#8722;C3 bond in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.







Abstract
Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.

         <dc:description>
(002) Facets exposed WO3 nanosheets display excellent performance in selective photoelectrochemical oxidization of glycerol to glyceric acid, reaching 73&#8201;% glyceric acid selectivity and 32.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 glyceric acid production at 0.9&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5G illumination.







Abstract
Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to high value&#8208;added chemicals offers an economical and sustainable approach to transform renewable feedstock as well as store green energy at the same time. In this work, we synthesized monoclinic WO3 nanosheets with exposed (002) facets, which could selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid (GLYA) with a photocurrent density of 1.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a 73&#8201;% GLYA selectivity and a 39&#8201;% GLYA Faradaic efficiency at 0.9&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Compared to (200) facets exposed WO3, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations indicates that the superior performance of selective glycerol oxidation mainly originates from the better charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime resulted from the plenty of surface trapping states, lower energy barrier of the glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;GLYA reaction pathway, more abundant active sites and stronger oxidative ability of photogenerated holes on the (002) facets exposed WO3. Our findings show great potential to significantly contribute to the sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes via designing high performance photoelectrochemical cell via facet engineering for renewable feedstock transformation.

         <title>In situ Light&#8208;Writable Orientation Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Film Enabled by Chalcones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), where anisotropy can be written by linearly polarized light based on the photoinduced cycloaddition reaction of chalcone mesogens, is accomplished. Importantly, the sophisticated topography changes are realized by implanting regionally distributed anisotropy into LCE sheets.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with intrinsic anisotropy. However, it is still challenging to in situ program the mesogen alignment to realize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) deformations with high&#8208;resolution patterned structures. This work presents a feasible strategy to program the anisotropy of LCEs by using chalcone mesogens that can undergo a photoinduced cycloaddition reaction under linear polarized light. It is shown that by controlling the polarization director and the irradiation region, patterned alignment distribution in a freestanding LCE film can be created, which leads to complex and reversible 3D shape&#8208;morphing behaviors. The work demonstrates an in situ light&#8208;writing method to achieve sophisticated topography changes in LCEs, which has potential applications in encryption, sensors, and beyond.

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;Halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined photocatalysis promises to achieve challenging chemical transformation, but the influence of confined structure has been ignored. Here, we propose a confinement model by encapsulating Cs3Bi2Br9 into one&#8208;dimensional insulated channels of porous silica nanomembranes, rendering the concentrated electric field, high exposure of &#8901;O2&#8722; and enhanced mass transfer for exceptional photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement.







Abstract
Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70&#8197;nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO conversion efficiency of 98.2&#8201;% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14&#8197;h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15&#8211;90&#8201;%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#8901;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9. This work expands an innovative strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts for air pollution remediation.

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidated that the kinetical pathway can be maintained by regulating the structural connectivity of the in situ induced electrochemical Li reservoir, which ensures efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway. The well&#8208;distributed electrochemical Li reservoirs can serve as nucleation sites to promote uniform Li deposition and then improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries effectively.







Abstract
Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 Coupling of Carbon&#8208;Centered Benzyl Radicals with (Me4N)SCF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 coupling of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent was developed to afford enantioenriched trifluoromethylthiolated molecules. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
In contrast with the well&#8208;established C(sp2)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling to forge the Ar&#8722;SCF3 bond, the corresponding enantioselective coupling of readily available alkyl electrophiles to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 bond has remained largely unexplored. We herein disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 coupling of a range of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands through tuning electronic and steric effects for the simultaneous control of the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity. This strategy can successfully realize two types of asymmetric radical reactions, including enantioconvergent C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling of racemic benzyl halides and three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;carbotrifluoromethylthiolation of arylated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. It therefore provides a highly flexible platform for the rapid assembly of an array of enantioenriched SCF3&#8208;containing molecules of interest in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;In contrast with the well-established C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cross-coupling to forge the Ar&#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond, the corresponding enantioselective coupling of readily available alkyl electrophiles to forge chiral C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond has remained largely unexplored. We herein disclose a copper-catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coupling of a range of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N)SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reagent. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino-oxazoline-derived anionic N,N,P-ligands through tuning electronic and steric effects for the simultaneous control of the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity. This strategy can successfully realize two types of asymmetric radical reactions, including enantioconvergent C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cross-coupling of racemic benzyl halides and three-component 1,2-carbotrifluoromethylthiolation of arylated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. It therefore provides a highly flexible platform for the rapid assembly of an array of enantioenriched SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing molecules of interest in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Shortwave&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;aggregates of Aromatic Ring&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs by Peripheral Substituents for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies at Ultralow Laser Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic ring [b]&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPYs are modified with multiple methoxyl groups to regulate the molecular surface electrostatic potential which successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregates. Importantly, BDP&#8208;a exhibits controllable J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation behaviors with adjustable morphologies. Its self&#8208;assembled J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles could be used for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapies under ultralow laser power density.







Abstract
Achieving photothermal therapy (PTT) at ultralow laser power density is crucial for minimizing photo&#8208;damage and allowing for higher maximum permissible skin exposure. However, this requires photothermal agents to possess not just superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), but also exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptivity. J&#8208;aggregates, exhibit a significant redshift and narrower absorption peak with a higher extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, achieving predictable J&#8208;aggregates through molecular design remains a challenge. In this study, we successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregation (&#955;absmax: 968&#8197;nm, &#1013;: 2.96&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#955;emmax: 972&#8197;nm, &#934;FL: 6.2&#8201;%) by tuning electrostatic interactions between &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular planes through manipulating molecular surface electrostatic potential of aromatic ring&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. Notably, by controlling the preparation method for encapsulating dyes into F&#8208;127 polymer, we were able to selectively generate H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, the J&#8208;aggregates exhibited two controllable morphologies: nanospheres and nanowires. Importantly, the shortwave&#8208;infrared J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles with impressive PCE of 72.9&#8201;% effectively destroyed cancer cells and mice&#8208;tumors at an ultralow power density of 0.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (915&#8197;nm). This phototherapeutic nano&#8208;platform, which generates predictable J&#8208;aggregation behavior, and can controllably form J&#8208;/H&#8208;aggregates and selectable J&#8208;aggregate morphology, is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor&#8208;treatment at ultralow laser power density.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for upcycling PET waste into high&#8208;valued chemicals. The distinct phase structures of ZrO2, with different acid sites, play a crucial role in regulating product selectivity. Specifically, 5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2, with weak acid sites, shows high selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of MMB, while 5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2, featuring strong acid sites, predominantly produces overhydrogenated PX







Abstract
Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86&#8201;% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75&#8201;%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8722;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Unraveling the Chirality Transfer from Circularly Polarized Light to Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality transfer from light to matter was explored by proceeding with the plasmon&#8208;driven chemical reaction involving chirally distributed hot electrons with achiral Au nanoparticles and circularly polarized light. The chiral light&#8208;matter interactions were unraveled by circular differential scattering spectroscopy at the single particle level and theoretical simulations.







Abstract
Due to their broken symmetry, chiral plasmonic nanostructures have unique optical properties and numerous applications. However, there is still a lack of comprehension regarding how chirality transfer occurs between circularly polarized light (CPL) and these structures. Here, we thoroughly investigate the plasmon&#8208;assisted growth of chiral nanoparticles from achiral Au nanocubes (AuNCs) via CPL without the involvement of any chiral molecule stimulators. We identify the structural chirality of our synthesized chiral plasmonic nanostructures using circular differential scattering (CDS) spectroscopy, which is correlated with scanning electron microscopy imaging at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels. Theoretical simulations, including hot&#8208;electron surface maps, reveal that the plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer is mediated by the asymmetric distribution of hot electrons on achiral AuNCs under CPL excitation. Furthermore, we shed light on how this plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer can also be utilized for chiral growth in bimetallic systems, such as Ag or Pd on AuNCs. The results presented here uncover fundamental aspects of chiral light&#8208;matter interaction and have implications for the future design and optimization of chiral sensors and chiral catalysis, among others.

The utilization rate of active sites in cathode materials for Zn&#8208;based batteries is a key factor determining the reversible capacities. However, a long&#8208;neglected issue of the strong electrostatic repulsions among divalent Zn2+ in hosts inevitably causes the squander of some active sites (i.e., gap sites). Herein, we address this conundrum by unraveling the &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; mechanism of multiple charge carriers in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. The tailored MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid features an ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing (2.34&#8197;nm), superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure, demonstrating highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in the 1&#8197;M ZnSO4+0.5&#8197;M (NH4)2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The NH4+ and H+ ions can act as gap fillers to fully utilize the active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to accelerate the Zn2+ diffusion. Thus, unprecedentedly high rate capability (439.5 and 104.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) and ultra&#8208;long cycling life (8000 cycles) are achieved.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes with Dual Negatively Curved Heptagons: Extensive Synthesis and Spontaneous Resolution into Strippable Homochiral Lamellae with Helical Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with fused negative curvature and helicity have been facilely synthesized by twofold heptagonal cyclization. In addition to intriguing features arising from the dynamic chiral skeleton, the molecular packing of these curved helicenes can be modulated by the periphery groups and the extension of the skeleton. This leads to the formation of crystals with 31 helices and also homochiral nanosheets upon exfoliation.







Abstract
We report a unique category of &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with double negative curvatures. This is achieved by two&#8208;fold regioselective heptagonal cyclization of the oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole precursors through either intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation or Scholl reaction. The fusion of two heptagonal rings in the helical skeleton dramatically increases the intramolecular strain and forces the two terminal carbazole moieties to stack in a compressed fashion. The presence of the deformable negatively curved heptagonal rings endows the resulting diaza[7]helicenes with dynamic chiral skeletons, aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature and relatively low racemization barrier of ca. 25.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Further &#960;&#8208;extension on the carbazole moieties subsequently leads to a more sophisticated C2&#8208;symmetric homochiral triple helicene. Notably, these &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes show structure&#8208;dependent stacking upon crystallization, switching from heterochiral packing to intra&#8208;layer homochiral stacking. Interestingly, the C2&#8208;symmetric triple helicene molecules spontaneously resolve into a homochiral lamellar structure with 31 helix symmetry. Upon ultrasonication in a nonsolvent, the crystals can be readily exfoliated into large&#8208;area ultrathin nanosheets with height of ca. 4.4&#8197;nm corresponding to two layers of stacked triple helicene molecules and relatively thicker nanosheets constituted by even&#8208;numbered molecular lamellae. Moreover, regular hexagonal thin platelets with size larger than 30&#8197;&#956;m can be readily fabricated by flash aggregation.

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core&#8208;Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;expanded [10]annulene analog was synthesized and oxidized to its cationic states. These compounds exhibit notable structural flexibility, allowing for topological twisting. The dication displays a simultaneous presence of singly twisted and planar isomers within the crystal structure, distinguished by M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively. The tetracation shows H&#252;ckel aromaticity and open shell diradical nature.







Abstract
The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both 1 and its tetracation (14+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4SbF6&#8722;) exhibit a nearly planar conformation with a rectangular shape, akin to the E,Z,E,Z,Z&#8208;[10]annulene. In contrast, the radical cation (1&#8901;+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SbCl6&#8722;) possesses a doubly twisted H&#252;ckel topology. Furthermore, the dication (12+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722;) displays conformational flexibility in solution and crystalizes with the simultaneous presence of M&#246;bius&#8208;twisted (1a2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722;) and H&#252;ckel&#8208;planar (1b2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722;) isomers in its unit cell. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: (1) 1 demonstrates localized aromaticity with an alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure; (2) 1a2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722; and 1b2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SbCl6&#8722; with 48&#960; electrons are weakly M&#246;bius aromatic and H&#252;ckel antiaromatic, respectively; (3) 14+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4SbF6&#8722; exhibits H&#252;ckel aromaticity (46&#960;) and open&#8208;shell diradical character.

Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polar perovskite MhyPbBr3 (Mhy=methylhydrazine), combining the merits of the excellent charge transition and bulk photovoltage effect, realized a sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with a high sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The work first reports the unprecedented radiation photovoltage and efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D classic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, shedding light on future practical applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have achieved tremendous success in direct X-ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X-ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self-driven X-ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Mhy=methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47&#8197;V) and large mobility-lifetime product (1.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under X-ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with sensitive self-driven X-ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which surpasses those of most self-driven X-ray detectors.

         <title>Combining Multiple Photosensitizer Modules into One Supramolecular System for Synergetic Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metallo&#8208;cages that combine multiple photosensitizer modules synergistically have been constructed through a simple method using pyrylium&#8208;pyridinium salts and coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Compared with the modules, cages with a porphyrin core exhibit a significant enhancement in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging cancer treatment, requires the development of highly desirable photosensitizers (PSs) with integrated functional groups to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) would provide an alternative approach for combining multiple PSs synergistically. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful strategy of combining conventional chromophores (tetraphenylethylene, porphyrin, or Zn&#8208;porphyrin) with pyridinium salt PSs together through condensation reactions, followed by CDSA to construct a series of novel metallo&#8208;supramolecular PSs (S1&#8211;S3). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is dramatically enhanced by the direct combination of two different PSs, and further reinforced in the subsequent ensembles. Among all the ensembles, S2 with two porphyrin cores shows the highest ROS generation efficiency, specific interactions with lysosome, and strong emission for probing cells. Moreover, the cellular and living experiments confirm that S2 has excellent PDT efficacy, biocompatibility, and biosafety. As such, this study will enable the development of more efficient PSs with potential clinical applications.

         <title>Dipole Coupling Accelerated H2O Dissociation by Magnesium&#8208;Based Intermetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the d&#8208;band center is widely cited to predict the catalytic activity, the other factors, such as Coulomb interaction, have little been considered to design a catalyst for H2O&#8208;associated reactions. Using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we demonstrate the impact of dipole coupling on the H2O adsorption and dissociation processes.







Abstract
The water (H2O) dissociation is critical for various H2O&#8208;associated reactions, including water gas shift, hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrolysis corrosion. While the d&#8208;band center concept offers a catalyst design guideline for H2O activation, it cannot be applied to intermetallic or main group elements&#8208;based systems because Coulomb interaction was not considered. Herein, using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we illustrate the critical role of the dipole of the intermetallic catalysts for H2O dissociation. The H2O dissociation kinetics can be enhanced using MgxMey (Me=Co, Ni, Cu, Si and Al) as catalysts, and the hydrogen generation rate of Mg2Ni&#8208;loaded Mg reached 80&#8197;times as high as Ni&#8208;loaded Mg. The adsorbed H2O molecules strongly couple with the Mg&#8722;Me dipole of MgxMey, lowering the H2O dissociation barrier. The dipole&#8208;based H2O dissociation mechanism is applicable to non&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based systems, such as Mg2Si and Mg17Al12, offering a flexible catalyst design strategy for controllable H2O dissociation.

         <title>Phase Behavior of Charged Star Block Copolymers at Fluids Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) with a polystyrene (PS) core and a poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona was investigated at the water/toluene interface. The morphology of the s&#8208;BCPs was hexagonal&#8208;packed nanoporous film with s&#8208;BCP comprising the matrix. The morphology of linear BCPs were found to be inverted, where hexagonally packed rigid spherical micelles of BCP formed multilayer.







Abstract
The phase behavior of block copolymers (BCPs) at the water&#8208;oil interface is influenced by the segmental interaction parameter (
) and chain architecture. We synthesized a series of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) having polystyrene (PS) as core and poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona. The interaction parameters of block&#8208;block (
PS&#8208;P2VP) and block&#8208;solvent (
P2VP&#8208;solvent) were varied by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution. Lowering pH increased the fraction of quaternized&#8208;P2VP (Q&#8208;P2VP) with enhanced hydrophilicity. By transferring the equilibrated interfacial assemblies, morphologies ranging from bicontinuous films at pH of 7 and 3.1 to nanoporous and nanotubular structure at pH of 0.65 were observed. The nanoporous films formed hexagonally packed pores in s&#8208;BCP matrix, while nanotubes comprised Q&#8208;P2VP as corona and PS as core. Control over pore size, d&#8208;spacing between pores, and nanotube diameters was achieved by varying polymer concentration, molecular weight, volume fraction and arm number of s&#8208;BCPs. Large&#8208;scale nanoporous films were obtained by freeze&#8208;drying emulsions. Remarkably, the morphologies of linear BCPs were inverted, forming hexagonal&#8208;packed rigid spherical micelles with Q&#8208;P2VP as core and PS as corona in multilayer. This work provides insights of phase behaviors of BCP at fluids interface and offer a facile approach to prepare nanoporous film with well&#8208;controlled pore structure.

         <title>Meltable Aluminum Molecular Rings with Fluorescence and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of meltable aluminum molecular rings with precise lattice doping of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) shows that the abundant, complex and strong hydrogen bonds between the clusters and the DESs components is responsible for the melting behavior. The hot&#8208;press method is used to prepare transparent bubble&#8208;free cluster&#8208;based glass films under autogenous pressure and study their fluorescence and nonlinear optical properties.







Abstract
Crystal&#8211;liquid&#8211;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk&#8208;shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble&#8208;free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot&#8208;press method. These cluster&#8208;based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics.

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive study of meltable aluminum molecular rings with precise lattice doping of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) shows that the abundant, complex and strong hydrogen bonds between the clusters and the DESs components is responsible for the melting behavior. The hot-press method is used to prepare transparent bubble-free cluster-based glass films under autogenous pressure and study their fluorescence and nonlinear optical properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal&#8211;liquid&#8211;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk-shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble-free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot-press method. These cluster-based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics. It not only breaks the limitations of crystalline glass on metal and ligand types but also acts as a general guide for extending the range of meltable crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>H* Species Regulation by Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 for Efficient Nitrate Electro&#8208;reduction in Neutral Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn doped Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst was designed to promote the NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 by accelerating the H* generation from water dissociation and inhibiting the H* binding between each other for hydrogen evolution, which ensures the much enhanced FE (98.9%) and stability (500&#8197;h) for ammonia production.







Abstract
During the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) under neutral condition, the activation of H2O to generate H* and the inhibition of inter&#8208;H* species binding, are critically important but remain challenging for suppressing the non&#8208;desirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Mn&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 (named as Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2) has been synthesized by in situ reconstruction in the electrolyte, which is able to dissociate H2O molecules but inhibits the binding of H* species between each other owing to the increased interatomic spacing by the Mn&#8208;doping. The Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst offers a faradaic efficiency (FE) of as high as 98.9&#177;1.7% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an energy efficiency (EE) of 49.90&#177;1.03% for NH3 production by NO3&#8722;RR, which are among the highest of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, negligible degradation at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been found for at least 500&#8197;h, which is the longest catalytic durations ever reported. This work paves a novel approach for the design and synthesis of efficient NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Formation of Pd&#8208;DNA Hybrids Using Tailored Palladium&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Towards Heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective creation of Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structures using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208; hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) highlights its enhanced affinity for cytosine compared to the previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] (Cheld=chelidamic acid). The resulting assembly mimics a natural DNA double helix, with the [Pd(Aqa)(Cytosine)] units acting as metal&#8208;mediated base pairs and offers the potential for heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids.







Abstract
The formation of highly organized metal&#8208;DNA structures has significant implications in bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology and material science due to their unique properties and potential applications. In this study, we report on the conversion of single&#8208;stranded polydeoxycytidine (dC15) into a Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structure using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) through a self&#8208;assembly process. The resulting Pd&#8208;DNA assembly closely resembles a natural double helix, with continuous [Pd(Aqa)(C)] (C=cytosine) units serving as palladium&#8208;mediated base pairs, forming interbase hydrogen bonds and intrastrand stacking interactions. Notably, the design of the [Pd(Aqa)] complex favours the interaction with cytosine, distinguishing it from our previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] complex (Cheld=chelidamic acid). This finding opens possibilities for creating heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids where different complexes specifically bind to nucleobases. We confirmed the Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structural assembly and selective binding of the complexes using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Direct Synthesis by Organic Acid&#8208;Etching and Reconstruction Disclosure as Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES) is developed to realize the direct synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), allowing structural transformation to be uncovered during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using in situ characterizations. The reconstructed MOF shows an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons, leading to outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential and good stability.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Chemically bonded MOFs on supports are desirable yet lacking in routine synthesis, as they may allow variable structural evolution and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship to be disclosed. Herein, direct MOF synthesis is achieved by an organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES). Using &#960;&#8208;conjugated ferrocene (Fc) dicarboxylic acid as the etching agent and organic ligand, a series of MFc&#8208;MOF (M=Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) nanosheets are synthesized on the metal supports. The crystal structure is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and low&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy, which is quasi&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched with that of the metal, enabling in situ MOF growth. Operando Raman and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy disclose that the NiFc&#8208;MOF features dynamic structural rebuilding during OER. The reconstructed one showing optimized electronic structures with an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high M&#8722;O bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons on adsorbates indicated by density functional theory calculations, exhibits outstanding OER performance with a fairly low overpotential (130&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and good stability (144&#8197;h). The newly established approach for direct MOF synthesis and structural reconstruction disclosure stimulate the development of more prudent catalysts for advancing OER.

         <title>Chemically Transformed Ag2Te Nanowires on Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane For Flexible Thermoelectric Applications</title>

A flexible thermoelectric generator is prepared from chemically transformed Ag2Te nanowires, which are prepared from tellurium nanowires, for low power wearable and flexible electronic devices.







Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices of nanomaterials have shown a great potential for applications in wearable to remotely located electronics with desired shapes and geometries. Continuous powering up the low power flexible electronics is a major challenge. We are reporting a flexible thermoelectric module prepared from silver telluride (Ag2Te) nanowires (NWs), which are chemically transformed from uniquely synthesized and scalable tellurium (Te) NWs. Conducting Ag2Te NWs composites have shown an ultralow total thermal conductivity ~0.22&#8197;W/mK surpassing the bulk melt&#8208;grown Ag2Te ~1.23&#8197;W/mK at ~300&#8197;K, which is attributed to the nanostructuring of the material. Flexible thermoelectric device consisting of 4 legs (n&#8208;type) of Ag2Te NWs on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane displays a significant output voltage (Voc) ~2.3&#8197;mV upon human touch and Voc ~18&#8197;mV at temperature gradient, &#916;T ~50&#8197;K, which shows the importance of NWs based flexible thermoelectric devices to power up the low power wearable electronics.

Conducting Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te NWs composites have shown an ultralow total thermal conductivity ~0.22&#8197;W/mK surpassing the bulk melt-grown Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te ~1.23&#8197;W/mK at ~300&#8197;K, which is attributed to the nanostructuring of the material. Flexible thermoelectric device consisting of 4 legs (n-type) of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te NWs on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane displays a significant output voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) ~2.3&#8197;mV upon human touch and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; ~18&#8197;mV at temperature gradient, &#916;T ~50&#8197;K, which shows the importance of NWs based flexible thermoelectric devices to power up the low power wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Synthesis of Topological Gels by Penetrating Polymerization Using a Molecular Net (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 11/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to obtain hydrogel with a topologically cross&#8208;linked structure has been developed by Yuichi Ohya et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202317045). Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. A water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure was synthesized. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, and the extending polymer chains&#160;penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.

         <dc:description>
Developing effective catalysts for chemical recycling of high&#8208;density polyethylene with commercial grade stands out due to its inertness. In their Research Article (e202317526), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that 1&#8208;nm ruthenium particles supported on titania catalyze the hydrogenolysis to C1&#8211;C45 alkanes of plastic caps used in soft drinks. They quantify the contribution of mechanistic routes and identify deactivation pathways introduced by common additives.

Dipole coupling between catalysts and H2O molecules is utilized to control H2O adsorption and dissociation processes. In their Research Article (e202400119), Yangfan Lu, Qian Li, Fusheng Pan et&#8197;al. showed that the catalyst's dipole moment can be adjusted by modifying the electronegativity gap of utilized elements and realized a systematic control of H2O activation processes. These discoveries offer a catalyst design guideline for the H2O&#8208;associated reactions in addition to the widely cited d&#8208;band center concept.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Optimize the Properties of Organic Fluorophores for Imaging and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review has clarified the reasons for the insufficient properties of fluorophores, including short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, and summarizes the methods for optimizing these properties developed in recent years. The review will provide a theoretical guidance and helpful insights for the design of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores are indispensable tools in cells, tissue and in vivo imaging, and have enabled much progress in the wide range of biological and biomedical fields. However, many available dyes suffer from insufficient performances, such as short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, restricting their application in advanced imaging technology and complex imaging. Over the past two decades, many efforts have been made to improve these performances of fluorophores. Starting with the luminescence principle of fluorophores, this review clarifies the mechanisms of the insufficient performance for traditional fluorophores to a certain extent, systematically summarizes the modified approaches of optimizing properties, highlights the typical applications of the improved fluorophores in imaging and sensing, and indicates existing problems and challenges in this area. This progress not only proves the significance of improving fluorophores properties, but also provide a theoretical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.

         <title>Multiphasic Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactors for Handling Gaseous Reagents in Organic Synthesis: Enhancing Efficiency and Safety in Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using highly reactive gases is appealing for efficient organic synthesis but leads to inherent safety and processing limitations. Embracing continuous&#8208;flow technologies helps mitigating those while improving the performance of the systems. Tailored catalyst incorporation opens doors to novel reaction pathways and process intensification. Optimized mass transfer in multiphasic mixtures is key to its success, especially when solids are present.







Abstract
The use of reactive gaseous reagents for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a scientific challenge due to safety and efficiency limitations. The implementation of continuous&#8208;flow reactors has resulted in rapid development of gas&#8208;handling technology because of several advantages such as increased interfacial area, improved mass&#8208; and heat transfer, and seamless scale&#8208;up. This technology enables shorter and more atom&#8208;economic synthesis routes for the production of pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we provide an overview of literature from 2016 onwards in the development of gas&#8208;handling continuous&#8208;flow technology as well as the use of gases in functionalization of APIs.

         <title>Catalytic Protein Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic inhibitors (CIs) mediate some type of post&#8208;translational modification that inactivates the target protein. This can provide a substantial increase in potency relative to occupancy&#8208;driven inhibitors. This article reviews the development of this field, current applications in targeted protein degradation, and design considerations for non&#8208;degradative CIs.







Abstract
Many of the highest priority targets in a wide range of disease states are difficult&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. The development of reversible small molecule inhibitors for the active sites of these proteins with sufficient affinity and residence time on&#8208;target is an enormous challenge. This has engendered interest in strategies to increase the potency of a given protein inhibitor by routes other than further improvement in gross affinity. Amongst these, the development of catalytic protein inhibitors has garnered the most attention and investment, particularly with respect to protein degraders, which catalyze the destruction of the target protein. This article discusses the genesis of the burgeoning field of catalytic inhibitors, the current state of the art, and exciting future directions.

         <title>Pentazolate Anion: A Rare and Preferred Five&#8208;Membered Ligand for Constructing Pentasil&#8208;Zeolite Topology Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The penta&#8208;coordinated pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) can be viewed as an enlarged pentagon. Three zeolitic or zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks (MPFs) were assembled under different auxiliary ligands and solvent environments. They both feature pentagonal building units composed of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anions, implying the unique potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; for constructing pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies.







Abstract
As the fourth full&#8208;nitrogen structure, the pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) was highly coveted for decades. In 2017, the first air&#8208;stable non&#8208;metal pentazolate salt, (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl, was obtained, representing a milestone in this field. As the latest member of the azole family, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; is comprised of five nitrogen atoms. Although significant attention has been paid to the potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; as an energetic material, its poor thermostability hinders any practical application. However, the unique ring structure and multiple coordination capability of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; provide a platform for the fabrication of various structures, among which pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are the most intriguing. In addition, the introduction of structure&#8208;directing auxiliaries enables the self&#8208;assembly of diverse topological architectures, potentially imparting cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; with the potential to impact wide&#8208;ranging areas of coordination chemistry and topology. In this minireview, different pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies based on metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks are evaluated. To date, three zeolitic and zeolite&#8208;like topologies have been reported, namely the melanophlogite (MEP), chibaite (MTN), and unj topologies. The MEP topology consists of two nanocages, Na20N60 and Na24N60, whereas the MTN topology contains Na20N60 and Na28N80 nanocages. Furthermore, the unj topology features multiple homochiral channels consisting of two helical chains. Various possible strategies for obtaining additional pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are also discussed.

Two dimensional (2D) metastable&#8208;phase oxides, which combine the distinctive characteristics of metal oxides, 2D materials, and metastable&#8208;phase materials, have attracted significant attention. This Minireview predicts the occurrence and highlights the advantages, reliable syntheses, and catalytic applications of 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides.







Abstract
Since the discovery of graphene, the development of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials has received considerable interest. Recently, as a newly emerging member of the 2D family, 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides that combine the unique advantages of metal oxides, 2D structures, and metastable&#8208;phase materials have shown enormous potential in various catalytic reactions. In this review, the potential of various 2D materials to form a metastable&#8208;phase is predicted. The advantages of 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides for advanced applications, reliable methods of synthesizing 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides, and the application of these oxides in different catalytic reactions are presented. Finally, the challenges associated with 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides and future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 Oligomerization in Cell Membrane Revealed by Photo&#8208;Activated Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights from super&#8208;resolution microscopy: Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2), a widely used optogenetic tool, forms dimers, not higher oligomers, in human cell membranes. Disruption of inter&#8208;protein disulfide bonds leads to partial ChR2 monomerization, particularly in cells with lower ChR2 densities. This study enhances the understanding of ChR2 oligomerization and assists optogenetic tool design.







Abstract
Microbial rhodopsins are retinal membrane proteins that found a broad application in optogenetics. The oligomeric state of rhodopsins is important for their functionality and stability. Of particular interest is the oligomeric state in the cellular native membrane environment. Fluorescence microscopy provides powerful tools to determine the oligomeric state of membrane proteins directly in cells. Among these methods is quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (qPALM) allowing the investigation of molecular organization at the level of single protein clusters. Here, we apply qPALM to investigate the oligomeric state of the first and most used optogenetic tool Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. ChR2 appeared predominantly as a dimer in the cell membrane and did not form higher oligomers. The disulfide bonds between Cys34 and Cys36 of adjacent ChR2 monomers were not required for dimer formation and mutations disrupting these bonds resulted in only partial monomerization of ChR2. The monomeric fraction increased when the total concentration of mutant ChR2 in the membrane was low. The dissociation constant was estimated for this partially monomerized mutant ChR2 as 2.2&#177;0.9 proteins/&#956;m2. Our findings are important for understanding the mechanistic basis of ChR2 activity as well as for improving existing and developing future optogenetic tools.

         <title>BN&#8208;Isosteres of Nonacene with Antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 Heterocycles: Synthesis and Strong Luminescence
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto longest nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres with antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles embedded in the backbones have been synthesized. The position of the antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 rings remarkably affects the molecular orbital arrangement of the BN&#8208;nonacenes. BN&#8208;3 displays a favorable radiative transition and thus a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of 92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Embedding both boron and nitrogen into the backbone of acenes to generate their isoelectronic structures has significantly enriched the acene chemistry to offer appealing properties. However, only small BN&#8208;heteroacenes have been extensively investigated, with BN&#8208;heptacenes as the hitherto longest homologue. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres via incorporating a pair of antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN&#8208;heteroacenes. The distance between the B2C4 and N2C4 rings affects the contribution of the charge&#8208;separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of BN&#8208;3 is greatly enhanced compared with BN&#8208;1 and BN&#8208;2, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN&#8208;isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Topological Gels by Penetrating Polymerization Using a Molecular Net</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. We synthesized a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.







Abstract
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints; ideally, no attractive intermolecular interactions act between their components, which yields interesting physical properties. However, most reported previous topological gels were synthesized based on supramolecular interlocked structures such as polyrotaxane, for which attractive intermolecular interactions are essential. Here, we synthesize a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure using poly(ethylene glycol). When a water&#8208;soluble monomer (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) is polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrates the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components. The MN gels show unique physical properties as well a significantly high degree of swelling and high extensibility due to slipping of the physical cross&#8208;linking. We postulate this method to yield a new paradigm in gel science with unprecedented physical properties.

         <title>An Organocopper(III) Fluoride Triggering C&#8722;CF3 Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocopper(III) fluoride, [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), has been isolated and authenticated. Despite its stability, 2 reacts with alkynylsilanes leading to industrially relevant trifluoromethylalkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3). Mechanistic investigations, including the trapping of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)] (4a), validates the operability of a CuI/CuIII redox shuttle in oxidative C&#8722;C couplings occurring through hitherto elusive organocopper(III) fluorides.







Abstract
Copper(III) fluorides are catalytically competent, yet elusive, intermediates in cross&#8208;coupling. The synthesis of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), the first stable (isolable) CuIII&#8722;F, was accomplished via chloride addition to [CuIII(CF3)3(py)] (1) yielding [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3Cl(py)] (1&#8901;Cl), followed by treatment with AgF. The CuIII halides 1&#8901;Cl and 2 were fully characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (Sc&#8208;XRD) and elemental analysis (EA). Complex 2 proved capable of forging C&#8722;CF3 bonds from silyl&#8208;capped alkynes. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies combining probes, theoretical calculations, trapping of intermediate 4a ([PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)]) and radical tests unveil the key role of the CuIII acetylides that undergo facile 2e&#8722; reductive elimination furnishing the trifluoromethylated alkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3), which are industrially relevant synthons in drug discovery, pharma and agrochemistry.

&lt;p&gt;The first organocopper(III) fluoride, [PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), has been isolated and authenticated. Despite its stability, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; reacts with alkynylsilanes leading to industrially relevant trifluoromethylalkynes (RC&#8801;CCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper(III) fluorides are catalytically competent, yet elusive, intermediates in cross-coupling.

         <title>Polar X&#8722;H Bond (X=O, S, N) Activation at a Cage Silanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon anions (silanides) supported by a tridentate nitrogen ligand are shown to undergo oxidative addition of X&#8722;H bonds (X=O, S, N) under mild conditions to form pentacoordinate hydrosilicates.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent silicon compounds such as neutral silylenes display versatile reactivity for the activation of small molecules. In contrast, their anionic congeners silanides ([R3Si&#8722;]) have primarily been investigated for their nucleophilic reactivity. Here we show that incorporating a silanide center in a bicyclic cage structure allows for formal oxidative addition of polar element&#8208;hydrogen bonds (RX&#8722;H, R=aromatic residue, X=O, S, NH). The resulting hydrosilicates were isolated and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations support an ionic mechanism for RX&#8722;H bond activation. Finally, the reactivity of the RS&#8722;H bond adduct was further investigated, revealing that it behaves as a Lewis pair upon facile heterolytic cleavage of the Si&#8722;S bond.

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized through the two&#8208;step sequential oxidation of readily available imine&#8208;linked COFs, eliminating the requirement for a predesigned OH. This innovative method has high conversion efficiency, crystallinity preservation, and broad applicability, marking a significant advancement in expanding the library of benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8722;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8722;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8722;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8722;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8722;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8722;COFs into BO&#8722;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8722;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;like Niobovanadate Cage Built from {(Nb)V5} Pentagon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic polyoxovanadate cage, V30Nb12, has been successfully synthesized by introducing Nb to polyoxovanadates and the V30Nb12 cage is assembled by 12 {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, similar to fullerene C60.







Abstract
The striking aesthetic appeal of fullerene&#8208;like clusters has captured the interest of researchers. Nevertheless, the assembly of fullerene&#8208;like polyoxovadanadate (POV) cages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable pentagonal motif. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic POV cage, {(V2O)V30Nb12O102(H2O)12} (V30Nb12), by introducing Nb into the POVs. V30Nb12 is assembled by 12 heterometallic {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, reminiscent of C60. To our knowledge, the fullerene&#8208;like V30Nb12 not only represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity POV cage but also stands as the first niobovanadate cluster. Notably, V30Nb12 exhibits excellent solution stability, as confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS, FT&#8208;IR and UV/Vis spectra. As there is no protection organic ligand on its outer surface, V30Nb12 can be further modified with Cu&#8208;complexes to form a fullerene&#8208;like cluster based zigzag chain (Cu&#8722;V30Nb12).
