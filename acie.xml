         <title>Self&#8208;propelled magnetic dendrite&#8208;shaped microrobots for photodynamic prostate cancer therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic micromotors that exhibit wireless and controllable motion by light have been extensively explored for cancer treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can down&#8208;regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level for cancer therapy. Herein, we present dendrite&#8208;shaped light&#8208;powered hematite microrobots as an effective GSH depletion agent&#160;for PDT of prostate cancer cells. These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot&#8217;s motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance. The proposed dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots contribute to developing dual light/magnetic field&#8208;powered micromachines for the biomedical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Mechanisms of Fluorophores Employed in Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decoding cellular processes requires visualization of spatial distribution and dynamic interactions of biomolecules. It is therefore not surprising that innovations in imaging technologies have facilitated advances in biomedical research. The advent of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies has empowered biomedical researchers with the ability to answer long&#8208;standing questions about cellular processes at an entirely new level. Fluorescent probes greatly enhance the specificity and resolution of super&#8208;resolution imaging experiments. Here, we introduce key super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies, with a brief discussion on single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We evaluate the chemistry and photochemical mechanisms of fluorescent probes employed in SMLM. This review provides guidance on the identification and adoption of fluorescent probes in single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and inspire the designs for next&#8208;generation fluorescent probes amenable to single&#8208;molecule imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Peptide Multi&#8208;Macrocyclizations at the Surface of a Helical Foldamer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of different macrocycles can be implemented using Cys residues within a peptide and chloroacetamides at the surface of a foldamer helix by placing the latter at precise locations. Helix rigidity and faster formation of smaller macrocycles make the favored product largely predictable.







Abstract
Hybrid sequences comprising a peptide with several Cys residues and an aromatic foldamer helix with several chloroacetamide functions at its surface were synthesized. Such products may in principle form numerous macromulticyclic thioether products by intramolecularly combining all Cys residues and all chloroacetamide functions. However, we show that the reactive sites on the structurally defined helix can be placed at such locations that the peptide selectively stitches itself to form a series of different macrocycles within mostly one preferred product. Reactions were monitored by HPLC and products with two, three or four macrocycles were identified using LC&#8211;MS and NMR. The series of selective macrocyclizations define a sort of reaction trail where reaction sites otherwise identical are involved successively because of their precise positioning in space. The trails can be predicted to a large extent based on structural considerations and the assumption that smaller macrocycles form faster.

         <title>Regulating Surface Reaction Kinetics through Ligand Field Effects for Fast and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The boron acid additive can alleviate the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction by modulating the solvation sheath. The formed solvation structure with moderate ligand field strength enables fast and highly reversible Zn deposition.







Abstract
Designing water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath of Zn2+ by ligand substitution is a widely used strategy to protect Zn metal anode, yet the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the side hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a huge challenge. Herein, we find boric acid (BA) with moderate ligand field interaction can partially replace H2O molecules in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, forming a stable water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath. It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever&#8208;reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining Using Chemometric Methods: A Need for Chemists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining: Large and complex chemical data sets generated by modern analytical technologies have led to the so&#8208;called Big (Bio)Chemical Data era. These data sets can be produced using modern analytical instruments such as multi&#8208;dimensional chromatography, high&#8208;resolution and multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging and DNA/RNA microarrays. Chemometric methods have shown potential to analyze BBCD especially in omics sciences and chemical toxicology/drug discovery.







Abstract
This Review summarizes how big (bio)chemical data (BBCD) can be analyzed with multivariate chemometric methods and highlights some of the important challenges faced by modern analytical researches. Here, the potential of chemometric methods to solve BBCD problems that are being encountered in chromatographic, spectroscopic and hyperspectral imaging measurements will be discussed, with an emphasis on their applications to omics sciences. In addition, insights and perspectives on how to address the analysis of BBCD are provided along with a discussion of the procedures necessary to obtain more reliable qualitative and quantitative results. In this Review, the importance of &#8220;big data&#8221; and of their relevance to (bio)chemistry are first discussed. Thereafter, analytical tools which can produce BBCD are presented as well as the theoretical background of chemometric methods and their limitations when they are applied to BBCD. Finally, the importance of chemometric methods for the analysis of BBCD in different chemical disciplines is highlighted with some examples. In this work, we have tried to cover many of the current applications of big data analysis in the (bio)chemistry field.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Excited Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Silyl&#8208;Radical&#8208;Mediated Direct Activation of Carbamoyl Chlorides To Access (Hetero)aryl Carbamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nickel catalysis enabled silyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of carbamoyl chlorides. This process provides an operationally simple and widely applicable amidation reaction of a plethora of aryl and hetero(aryl) halides. Mechanistic understanding suggests that the reaction involves an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism for aryl bromide; while a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is operating for aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Amide bonds connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling by merging the photo&#8208;redox and transition&#8208;metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this method relies on the prior formation of NiII&#8208;aryl halide intermediates, which involves in a photoexcited Ni&#8208;halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single&#8208;electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is demonstrated both in inter&#8208; as well as intramolecular routes for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.

&lt;p&gt;Photoexcited nickel catalysis enabled silyl-radical-mediated activation of carbamoyl chlorides. This process provides an operationally simple and widely applicable amidation reaction of a plethora of aryl and hetero(aryl) halides. Mechanistic understanding suggests that the reaction involves an energy-transfer mechanism for aryl bromide; while a single-electron-transfer mechanism is operating for aryl chlorides.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amide bonds connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross-electrophile coupling by merging the photo-redox and transition-metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this method relies on the prior formation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-aryl halide intermediates, which involves in a photoexcited Ni-halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single-electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is demonstrated both in inter- as well as intramolecular routes for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Oxyhalogenation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkynes via Directed Nucleopalladation: Catalytic Access to Tetrasubstituted Alkenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxyhalogenation of unactivated internal alkynes is facilitated by a structurally tuned bidentate directing auxiliary, providing rapid access to tetrasubstitued alkenes that can be further diversified into valuable products.







Abstract
A catalytic 1,2&#8208;oxyhalogenation method that converts non&#8208;conjugated internal alkynes into tetrasubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is described. Mechanistically, the reaction involves a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle that begins with a directed oxypalladation step. The origin of regioselectivity is the preference for formation of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate, which is facilitated by an N,N&#8208;bidentate 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isopropyl (PIP) amide directing group. Selectivity for C(alkenyl)&#8722;X versus &#8722;N (X=halide) reductive elimination from the PdIV center depends on the identity of the halide anion; bromide and iodide engage in C(alkenyl)&#8722;X formation, while intramolecular C(alkenyl)&#8722;N reductive elimination occurs with chloride to furnish a lactam product. DFT calculations shed light on the origins of this phenomenon.

         <title>Boosting Bismuth(III) Complexation for Targeted &#945;&#8208;Therapy (TAT) Applications with the Mesocyclic Chelating Agent AAZTA

[Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; and derivatives have been comprehensively characterized. Fast formation, remarkable stability, strong accumulation in AR42J tumour make 213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; an outstanding candidate for TAT.







Abstract
Targeted &#945; therapy (TAT) is a promising tool in the therapy of cancer. The radionuclide 213BiIII shows favourable physical properties for this application, but the fast and stable chelation of this metal ion remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the mesocyclic chelator AAZTA quickly coordinates BiIII at room temperature, leading to a robust complex. A comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of [Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; is reported, along with bifunctional [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;COO&#8722;)]2&#8722; and the targeted agent [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;, which incorporates the SSR agonist Tyr3&#8208;octreotate. An unexpected increase in the stability and kinetic inertness of the metal chelate was observed for the bifunctional derivative and was maintained for the peptide conjugate. A cyclotron&#8208;produced 205/206Bi mixture was used as a model of 213Bi in labelling, stability, and biodistribution experiments, allowing the efficiency of [213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; to be estimated. High accumulation in AR42J tumours and reduced kidney uptake were observed with respect to the macrocyclic chelate [213Bi(DOTA&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Polymers via Coordination Post&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers was prepared using soluble and well&#8208;defined MOPs as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks. The introduction of MOPs constructs a coordination dynamic network that not only enhances mechanical properties but also realizes multifunctionality including self&#8208;healing, shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. CHMOPs provide a novel platform for expansion of the smart soft materials.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks with reversible and dynamic characteristics are gaining increasing interest in diverse application fields. Herein, we use a coordination crosslinking approach using metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks to post&#8208;assemble a class of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers. The introduction of 12&#8208;connected MOP nodes to the polymeric networks is critical to producing membranes that overcome the trade&#8208;off between mechanical properties and dynamic healing, and meanwhile possess multifunctionalities including shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. The CHMOPs can also be used for anticorrosion coating and achieve function couplings, e.g., shape memory&#8208;assisted self&#8208;healing (SMASH), which have not been achieved in the MOP&#8208;based hybrid materials yet. This work not only offers a feasible strategy to construct new multifunctional materials but also greatly expands the application scopes of MOPs.

         <title>Substrate Tumbling in a Chemisorbed Diastereomeric &#945;&#8208;Ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;Naphthyl)ethylamine Complex</title>

Guided by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and adsorption forces, an &#945;&#8208;ketoester tumbles between two prochiral states in a chemisorbed diastereomeric complex.







Abstract
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Conservation of Nickel Ion Single&#8208;Active Site Character in a Bottom&#8208;Up Constructed &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecular Network</title>

         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of covalent nickel tetraphenylporphyrin network on Au(111) is studied by a multitechnique approach combining local microscopic insights with space&#8208;averaging synchrotron radiation&#8208;based methods. Even though the porphyrin nanomesh is not perfectly ordered extending the &#960;&#8208;system results in the appearance of energy&#8208;dispersive electronic features while the Ni cores remain in the characteristic single&#8208;molecule configuration.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building&#8208;blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On&#8208;surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;&#8208;extended two&#8208;dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single&#8208;active site character of their single&#8208;molecule counterparts. This opens new pathways when exploiting the high robustness of transition metal cores provided by bottom&#8208;up constructed covalent nanomeshes.

         <title>Conferring BiVO4 Nanorods with Oxygen Vacancies to Realize Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoetching can confer BiVO4 with oxygen vacancies and enhance the catalytic performance of BiVO4. The photoetched BiVO4 can catalyze water splitting to generate oxygen and hydroxyl radicals under the mediation of ultrasound. The generated oxygen can relieve tumor hypoxia, thereby improving the sonodynamic cancer therapy performance of BiVO4.







Abstract
Owing to the high depth of tissue penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown broad application prospects for tumor treatment. However, the electron&#8208;hole separation inefficiency of sonosensitizers and the tumor hypoxia remain two major challenges limiting the effect of SDT. Here, ultrafine photoetched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanorods modified with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 (PEBVO@PEG NRs) were fabricated to achieve in situ self&#8208;supply of oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for hypoxic tumor therapy. The photoetching approach could enhance the charge separation by inducing enriched oxygen vacancies on the surface of BiVO4, thereby improving the generation efficiency of ROS and O2. The PEBVO@PEG overcome the main obstacles of traditional sonosensitizers in the SDT process and show promising sonodynamic therapeutic effects, thus providing new strategies for improving the performance of sonosensitizer and hypoxic tumor elimination.

         <title>Direct Acquisition of the Gap Height of Biological Tissue&#8208;Electronic Chemical Sensor Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of nanopores was integrated at the electrochemical sensor plane and used to measuring the ion conductance between them providing a versatile strategy to directly determine the gap height during exocytotic release from tissues. Direct cooperative measurement of the gap height and exocytotic release at the same sensor can be used to address the long&#8208;term question of the influence of diffusional filtering on the exocytotic spike.







Abstract
Interfacing biological tissues with electronic sensors offers the exciting opportunity to accurately investigate multiple biological processes. Accurate signal collection and application are the foundation of these measurements, but a long&#8208;term issue is the signal distortion resulting from the interface gap. The height of the gap is the key characteristic needed to evaluate or model the distortion, but it is difficult to measure. By integrating a pair of nanopores at the electronic sensor plane and measuring the ion conductance between them, we developed a versatile and straightforward strategy to realize the direct cooperative evaluation of the gap height during exocytotic release from adrenal gland tissues. The signaling distortion of this gap has been theoretically evaluated and shows almost no influence on the amperometric recording of exocytosis in a classic &#8220;semi&#8208;artificial synapse&#8221; configuration. This strategy should benefit research concerning various bio/chemical/machine interfaces.

         <title>Regioselective Access to Vicinal Diamines by Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitized Amidylimination of Alkenes with Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, photosensitized regioselective diamination of alkene is reported. The keys to this advance are: 1)&#8197;rational design of bifunctional diamination reagent, 2)&#8197;simultaneous generation of long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical with significantly differed reactivities, and 3)&#8197;involvement of photoinduced energy transfer reaction mode.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2&#8208;diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different N&#8208;centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diamine&#8208;containing complex molecule scaffolds.

         <title>Ultrastable Anti&#8208;Acid &#8220;Shield&#8221; in Layered Silver Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid resistance (12&#8197;M HCl) was made possible for two isomorphic two&#8208;dimensional silver&#8208;based coordination polymers. Protection is provided by a hydrophobic organic shell and a dynamic proton buffer layer via a thiolate&#8208;thione tautomerism of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole ligands. Thus, these ligands are promising surface inhibitors, acting as a dual protective shield against metal corrosion.







Abstract
Surface passivation technology provides noble&#8208;metal materials with limited chemical stability, especially under highly acidic condition. To design effective strategy to enhance stability of noble&#8208;metal particles, an understanding of their surface anticorrosion mechanism at the atomic level is desirable by using two&#8208;dimensional (2D) noble&#8208;metal coordination polymer (CP) as an ideal model for their interfacial region. With the protection of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole (TBI), we isolated two Ag&#8208;based 2D CPs, {Ag14(TBI)12X2}n (S&#8722;X, where S denotes sheet and X=Cl or Br). These compounds exhibited excellent chemical stability upon immersion in various common solvents, boiling water, boiling ethanol, 10&#8201;% hydrogen peroxide, concentrated acid (12&#8197;M HCl), and concentrated alkali (19&#8197;M NaOH). Systematic characterization and DFT analyses demonstrate that the superior stability of S&#8722;X was attributed to the hydrophobic organic shell and dynamic proton buffer layer acting as a double protective &#8220;shield&#8221;.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Poly(Imine&#8208;Carbonate) Derived from Plastic Waste and Bio&#8208;based Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) with a bio&#8208;based vanillin derivative into novel dialdehyde monomer DVEC is shown. DVEC was further polymerized by using primary amines into high&#8208;performance poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s. These modular polymers are reprocessable and chemically recyclable under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions, thereby enabling a closed&#8208;loop recycling scheme.







Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers represents the key technology to convert plastic waste in a sustainable fashion. Efficient chemical recycling and upcycling strategies are thus highly sought&#8208;after to establish a circular plastic economy. Here, we present the selective chemical depolymerization of polycarbonate by employing a vanillin derivative as bio&#8208;based feedstock. The resulting di&#8208;vanillin carbonate monomer was used in combination with various amines to construct a library of reprocessable poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s, which show tailor&#8208;made thermal and mechanical properties. These novel poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s exhibit excellent recyclability under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions. This allows the recovery of monomers in high yields and purity for immediate reuse, even when mixed with various commodity plastics. This work provides exciting new insights in the design of bio&#8208;based circular polymers produced by upcycling of plastic waste with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>Orthogonal Charge Transfer by Precise Positioning of Silver Single Atoms and Clusters on Carbon Nitride for Efficient Piezocatalytic Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;C2N2 single&#8208;sites and Ag clusters are co&#8208;confined on carbon nitride (CN). The enhanced in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization by Ag single atoms and rapid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transfer between Ag clusters and CN collectively contribute to the excellent piezocatalytic pure water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two&#8208;electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H2 and H2O2 shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co&#8208;anchored on carbon nitride (AgSA+C&#8722;CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, AgSA+C&#8722;CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H2 and H2O2 evolution rate of 7.90&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 5.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 is delivered by AgSA+C&#8722;CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts. This work not only presents the SAs decoration as an available polarization enhancement strategy, but also sheds light on the superiority of multi&#8208;sites engineering in piezocatalysis.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Material Based on Cross&#8208;Linking&#8208;Induced Emission: Applications in Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptable strategy toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior was developed. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.







Abstract
A versatile strategy for smart fluorescent materials is lacking due to their diverse responding mechanisms and incompatibility of responsive behaviors. Herein an adaptable strategy is presented toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior by blending linear polymers modified with different stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties and AIE cross&#8208;linker. Under stimuli, the linear polymer can cross&#8208;link with the cross&#8208;linker to form networks, which intrinsically restrict the intramolecular rotation of the AIE molecule to induce strong emission. A unified stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is involved in that various stimuli are transferred through the organized &#8220;stimulus&#8208;crosslink&#8208;emission&#8221; process. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.

         <title>Salting&#8208;Out Aldehyde from the Electrooxidation of Alcohols with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes has significant challenges, for example, it cannot realize the preparation of aldehydes selectively in alkaline aqueous solutions. By tuning the local microenvironment over the electrocatalyst, and thus selectively salting&#8208;out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface, the electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes was achieved in an efficient and green way.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehydes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to its higher reactivity than alcohol, the aldehyde is easily over&#8208;oxidized to acid in alkaline electrolytes. Herein we realize the selective electrooxidation of alcohol to aldehyde on NiO by tuning the local microenvironment to salt out the aldehyde from the reaction system. The origin of the high selectivity was found to be the inhibition of the hydration of aldehydes, which is the result of the decreased alkalinity and the increased cation and substrate concentration. This strategy could salt out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface from the electrooxidation of alcohol with 100&#8201;% selectivity and be easily extended to other selective oxidation reactions, such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) and amine to an imine.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxycarbonylation of Alkyl Bromides via a Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct alkoxycarbonylation pattern via an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; catalyst is reported. This low&#8208;valent iron catalyst activates alkyl halides via a two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, unlike previous reports where alkyl halides underwent a single electron transfer (SET). This reaction provides easy and efficient access to esters, and its mechanism will provide new ideas for the activation of alkyl halides in the field of carbonylation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are some of the most widely used methods in organic synthesis. However, despite the obvious advantages of iron as an abundant and low toxicity transition metal catalyst, its practical application in carbonylation reaction remains largely unexplored. Here we report our recent study on Fe&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is catalyzed by an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; complex. This low&#8208;valent iron species activates alkyl bromides via a distinctive two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, whereas it proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) process for alkyl iodides which is consistent with literature.

         <title>sp2 to sp3 Hybridization Transformation in Ionic Crystals under Unprecedentedly Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation in ionic crystals, the realization of internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic groups to covalent groups is proposed. It is demonstrated in a crystal of LiBO2 which undergoes the transformation at unprecedentedly low pressure of only 2.85&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Under cold pressure sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation has been exclusively observed in covalent or molecular crystals overwhelmingly above &#8776;10&#8197;GPa, and the approaches to lower the transition pressure are limited on external heat&#8208;treatment and/or catalyzers. Herein we demonstrate that, by internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic to covalent groups, the transformation can be significantly prompted, as shown in a crystal of LiBO2 under 2.85&#8197;GPa for the first case in ionic crystals. This unprecedentedly low transformation pressure is ascribed to the enhanced localized stress on covalent B&#8722;O frames transferred from ionic Li&#8722;O bonds in LiBO2, and accordingly the corresponding structural feature is summarized. This work provides an internal structural regulation strategy for pressure&#8208;reduction of the s&#8208;p orbital hybridization transformation and extends the sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 transformation landscape from molecular and covalent compounds to ionic systems.

         <title>Rationally Designing Efficient Electrocatalysts for Direct Seawater Splitting: Challenges, Achievements, and Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of electrocatalysts designed for the direct splitting of seawater. The mechanism of seawater splitting is introduced before the primary principles for designing catalysts (noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free) for seawater splitting are analyzed in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The future development of electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen generation is also discussed.







Abstract
Directly splitting seawater to produce hydrogen provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. However, current seawater splitting faces many challenges because of the sluggish kinetics, the presence of impurities, membrane contamination, and the competitive chloride oxidation reaction at the anode, which makes it more difficult than freshwater splitting. This Review firstly introduces the basic mechanisms of the anode and cathode reactions during seawater splitting. We critically analyze the primary principles for designing catalysts for seawater splitting in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including with noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Furthermore, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Accessibility and Reproducibility of Worm&#8208;like Micelles by In Situ Crosslinking Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles (W) is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), leading to significantly improved reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles. The reliability of the methodology has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems with different formulations of monomers, macro RAFT agents, crosslinkers, solvents, and polymerization temperatures.







Abstract
Worm&#8208;like micelles have attracted great interest due to their anisotropic structures. However, the experimental conditions for obtaining worm&#8208;like micelles are very restricted, which usually causes seriously poor reproducibility. In this work, significantly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is greatly improved due to the significantly enlarged experimental windows of worm&#8208;like micelles in the morphology diagram. Moreover, the reliability of the methodology to enhance the accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems. The greatly enhanced accessibility and reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is undoubtedly cost&#8208;effective especially in scale&#8208;up production, which paves the way for further application of worm&#8208;like micelles with various compositions and functionalities.

         <title>Surface Diffusion Aided by a Chirality Change of Self&#8208;Assembled Oligomers under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new functional molecular system with a combination of several advanced features, including a self&#8208;assembled oligomer, surface chirality, chirality switching, and finally their motion on the surface. Our results suggest that nonchiral molecules may be designed to induce switchable enantiomeric surface assemblies, relevant for heterogeneous catalysts.







Abstract
Chirality switching of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures is of potential interest for designing functional materials but is restricted by the strong interaction between the embedded molecules. Here, we report on an unusual approach based on reversible chirality changes of self&#8208;assembled oligomers using variable&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations. Six functionalized diazomethanes each self&#8208;assemble into chiral wheel&#8208;shaped oligomers on Ag(111). At 130&#8197;K, a temperature far lower than expected, the oligomers change their chirality even though the molecules reside in an embedded self&#8208;assembled structure. Each chirality change is accompanied by a slight center&#8208;of&#8208;mass shift. We show how the identical activation energies of the two processes result from the interplay of the chirality change with surface diffusion, findings that open the possibility of implementing various functional materials from self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures.

         <title>An Atypical Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Enables Efficient Biosynthesis of Extender Units for Engineering a Polyketide Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (ACS, UkaQ) with broad substrate specificity and an unusual catalytic mode was identified. Its stability and catalytic activity were remarkably improved by protein engineering, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs. In combination with permissive carboxylases, diverse extender units were synthesized and used to engineer the polyketide carbon scaffold of antimycin.







Abstract
Acyl&#8208;CoAs are key precursors of primary and secondary metabolism. Their efficient biosynthesis is often impeded by the limited substrate specificity and low in vivo activity of acyl&#8208;CoA synthetases (ACSs) due to regulatory acylation of the catalytically important lysine residue in motif A10 (Lys&#8208;A10). In this study, we identified an unusual ACS (UkaQ) from the UK&#8208;2A biosynthetic pathway that naturally lacks the Lys&#8208;A10 residue and exhibits extraordinarily broad substrate specificity. Protein engineering significantly improved its stability and catalytic activity, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs with highly robust activity. By combining it with permissive carboxylases, we produced a large array of polyketide extender units and obtained six novel halobenzyl&#8208;containing antimycin analogues through an engineered biosynthetic pathway. This study significantly expands the catalytic mode of ACSs and provides a potent tool for the biosynthesis of acyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived natural products.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of Multivalent DNA&#8208;Protein Superstructures for Tumor Imaging and Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multivalent DNA nanomaterials are designed through the biomimetic assembly of DNA with Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved protamine, providing biocompatible and stable drug carriers with high avidity in a simpler method. This practical approach achieves sensitive tumor imaging and targeted cancer therapy, and offers new clinical translation opportunities.







Abstract
Programmable DNA materials hold great potential in biochemical and biomedical researches, yet the complicated synthesis, and the low stability and targeting efficacy in complex biological milieu limit their clinical translations. Here we show a one&#8208;pot assembly of DNA&#8208;protein superstructures as drug vehicles with specifically high affinity and stability for targeted therapy. This is achieved by biomimetic assembly of programmable polymer DNA wire into densely packed DNA nanosphere with an alkaline protein, protamine. Multivalent DNA nanostructures encoded with different types and densities of aptamers exhibit high affinity to targeted cells through polyvalent interaction. Our results show high cancer cell selectivity, reduced side effect, excellent therapeutic efficacy, and sensitive tumor imaging in both subcutaneous and orthotopic non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer murine models. This biomimetic assembly approach provides practical DNA nanomaterials for further clinical trials and may advance oligonucleotide drug delivery.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;heterolepticity in Low&#8208;Symmetry Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages are prized for their structural complexity and multi&#8208;functionality. Controlling integrative self&#8208;sorting processes necessary to achieve defined self&#8208;assembly of these supramolecular hosts is a significant design challenge. In this work, ligand&#8208;tethering strategies are described that allow access to metal&#8208;organic cages with highly anisotropic cavities described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand scaffolds.







Abstract
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages, formed through integrative self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, are highly attractive as reduced symmetry supramolecular hosts. Ensuring high&#8208;fidelity, non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly, however, presents a significant challenge in molecular engineering due to the inherent difficulty in predicting thermodynamic energy landscapes. In this work, two conceptual strategies are described that circumvent this issue, using ligand design strategies to access structurally sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts. Using these approaches, it was possible to realise cavity environments described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand frameworks, representing a significant step forward in the construction of highly anisotropic confined spaces.

         <title>Unraveling the Complex Chirality Evolution in DNA&#8208;Assembled High&#8208;Order, Hybrid Chiroplasmonic Superstructures from Multi&#8208;Scale Chirality Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale chirality evolution was observed from DNA&#8208;assembled hybrid chiroplasmonic superstructures comprised of metal nanoparticles and organic chromophores, as a result of distinct fundamental chiral interactions at different hierarchical levels. The findings present new challenges to current theoretical frameworks to describe chiral hybrid systems, thus will motivate the related computational and theoretical advances.







Abstract
Hierarchical, chiral hybrid superstructures of chromophores and nanoparticles are expected to give rise to intriguing unveiled chiroptical responses originating from the complex chiral interactions among the components. Herein, DNA origami cavity that could self&#8208;assemble into one&#8208;dimensional (1D) DNA tubes was employed as a scaffold to accurately organize metal nanoparticles and chromophores. The chiral interactions were studied at the level of individual hybrid particles and their 1D hybrid superstructures. Complex chirality mechanisms involving global structural chirality, plasmon&#8208;induced circular dichroism (PICD) and exciton&#8208;coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) were disentangled. The multiplexed CD spectrum superposition revealed the chirality evolution at different length scales. These results can offer a model for boosting the theoretical understanding of classical&#8208;quantum hybrid systems, and would inspire the future design of optically&#8208;active substances across length scales.

         <title>Pt Atoms/Clusters on Ni&#8208;phytate&#8208;sensitized Carbon Nitride for Enhanced NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven Overall Water Splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm</title>

         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting was constructed by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven overall water splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm remains a high&#8208;priority target yet great challenge. Here we report that efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons in a photosensitized system prepared by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The optimal catalyst presents simultaneous hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution with an H2 evolution amount of 1.4&#8197;&#956;mol at &#955;&gt;800&#8197;nm for 24&#8197;hours, which its activity was approximately 140&#8197;times higher than that of a system without Pt&#8208;SAC modification (PA&#8208;Ni1.1@PCN). This work represents the first NIR&#8208;light responsive photosensitized system for overall water splitting, and may open an avenue for precisely manipulating cocatalyst positions at the atomic level to improve NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting via photosensitization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel antibacterial agents are urgently needed to control the infections induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, we rationally designed and facilely synthesized a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type luminogen with strong red/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission, great aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, and excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The newly developed molecule TTTh killed the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by triggering the ROS accumulation in bacteria and interrupting the membrane integrity. Moreover, TTTh specifically targeted the lysosomes and potentiated their maturation to accelerate the clearance of intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reduced bacterial burden and improved healing were observed in TTTh&#8208;treated wounds with negligible side effects. Our study expands the biological design and application of AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and provides new insights into discovering novel antibacterial targets and agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Charge Separation in Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) Imides with Semi&#8208;coherent Interfaces for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of heterojunctions is a promising manner to accelerate the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface. Herein, a binary poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides (PHI/PTI) with semi&#8208;coherent interfaces was fabricated via a facile two&#8208;step salt&#8208;melt synthetic process. The built&#8208;in electric fields at the semi&#8208;coherent interface endow prompt exciton splitting and charge carrier separation. Hence, the optimized PHI/PTI&#8208;based copolymer presents a high apparent quantum yield (AQY=64%) for visible&#8208;light driven hydrogen production, by the aids of K  2  HPO  4  as charge transfer mediator. This study provides physical insights for the rational promotion of the photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of interfacial engineering of photocatalytic junctions on crystalline carbon nitride based semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>A LRET Toolbox Consisting of Lanthanide and Amorphous Manganese Oxide for NIR&#8208;II Luminescence Lifetime Imaging of Tumor Redox Status</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing luminescence lifetime sensor in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window is a great challenge due to the difficult structural construction. Here, we report a tumor redox responsive and easy synthesized material, amorphous manganese oxide (MnO  x  ) with indirect bandgap of 1.02 eV as energy acceptor to build a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) toolbox for universally regulating NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide nanoparticles, in which energy transfer is based on matched energy gap instead of conventional overlapped spectra. We further utilize Yb  3+  doped YbNP@MnO  x  as NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime sensor to realize  in vitro  quantitative redox visualization with relative errors under 5% after mouse skin coverage. Furthermore, HepG2 cells and tumors with high redox state have been accurately distinguished by NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging. The quantified intracellular and intratumoral glutathione (GSH) levels are highly consistent with the commercial kit results, illustrating the reliable redox visualization ability under bio&#8208;tissue.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear Axially Chiral Conjugated Polymers Exhibiting Ultralong Low&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), as two important branches in the field of organic optical functional materials have broad prospects. In this work, a pair of novel conjugated polymers with low&#8208;temperature UOP and intense CPL properties are constructed by incorporating rigid axially chiral chromophores into polymeric backbone. The twisted and rigid biphenyl skeleton not only effectively reduce the energy gap between the S  1  and T to greatly facilitate the intersystem crossing process, but also suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay from T  1  to S  0  . As a result, a strong and ultralong afterglow of up to 33 s is achieved in 2&#8208;MeTHF at 77K. Moreover, the repeating rigid biphenyl skeleton with helix&#8208;like form also promotes the chiroptical activity of the polymers, and the intense signals are shown in low&#8208;temperature CPL spectra with absolute  g  lum  values of 9.7&#215;10  &#8208;3  and 5.8&#215;10  &#8208;3  at the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission peak, respectively. This work represents the first low&#8208;temperature materials with UOP and CPL property, which provides a new guideline and perspective for the development of persistent luminescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely overrides substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Controllable Nanoassemblies of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Abnormal Disassembly&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement for In Vivo Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been widely observed for luminophors but it causes emission decrease after disassembly. The construction of unique nanoassemblies with disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (DIEE) is demanded. Herein, by taking advantages of alterable siloxane bridge crosslinking states, we report a facile strategy to fabricate water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with abnormal DIEE. The fabricated AuNP nanoassemblies with dominate interparticle crosslinking showed a redshifted emission at ~1070 nm with quantum yields (QYs) of 1.8%. After disassembly, the nanoassemblies with increased intraparticle crosslinking exhibited a unique DIEE (&gt;6 folds, QYs, 12%) due to the enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition. Besides, the disassembly facilitated renal clearance of AuNPs to reduce nonspecific body retention, opening new possibilities for designing highly&#8208;emissive renal&#8208;clearable nanostructures toward more bioapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand the biological processes, but still remains a challenge to be realized in artificial systems. Herein, the helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity via kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained via thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide a methodology to explore chirality inversion accompanied with morphology transition by manipulating kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#160;Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of CO  2  &#160;by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers&#160;a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO  2  &#160;hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11 vol.%&#160;under 30 bar (CO  2  :H  2  &#160;= 1:3) at 170  o  C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water,&#160;the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1%, meanwhile the conversion of CO  2  &#160;underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO  2  /intermediates,&#160;facilitating&#160;the transformation of COOH* and CH  2  O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO  via  &#160;water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Distal Fe3+&#8208;sited Hetero&#8208;atomic Pairs Boosting Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous efforts regarding the hetero&#8208;atomic interaction have been investigated over the past decades, due to their heterogeneity, their individual roles among various atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, a facilely&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst with distal Fe3+&#8208;sited hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined onto a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate is validated to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.1 s&#8208;1 at 300 mV under alkaline environment. Through systematically operando characterization, Lewis acidic Fe3+ at the distal site in Co&#8208;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair is clarified to boost a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. Furthermore, significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer in pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance for Co&#8208;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pairs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rational utilization of the rich light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay taking place in single&#8208;cell analysis is debuting and represents a new technological direction in the arena. Light&#8208;fueled operation is expected to achieve advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) single&#8208;cell analysis with unknown possibilities. Here a PEC nanoreactor capable of single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background Faradic detection of intracellular microRNA (miR) is devised by construction of a small reaction chamber accommodating the target&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction for binding the metallointercalator of [Ru(bpy)  2  (dppz)]  2+  as the signal reporter.

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Graft Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of branching on polymer self&#8208;assembly is investigated by conducting polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of sparsely grafted poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) in n&#8208;dodecane. Electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray scattering techniques are used to characterise the resulting materials.







Abstract
We report the polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) copolymers during reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) grafting from polymerisation in a backbone&#8208;selective solvent. Electron microscopy images suggest the phase separation of grafts to result in a network of spherical particles, due to the ability of the branched architecture to freeze chain entanglements and to bridge core domains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering data suggest the architecture promotes the formation of multicore micelles, the core morphology of which transitions from spheres to worms, vesicles, and inverted micelles with increasing volume fraction of the grafts. A time&#8208;resolved SAXS study is presented to illustrate the formation of the inverted phase during a polymerisation. The grafted architecture gives access to unusual morphologies and provides exciting new handles for controlling the polymer structure and material properties.

         <title>Terminal and Super&#8208;Basic Parent Imides of Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear parent hafnium imido complex prepared by reduction of the bisazide precursor, afforded a terminally bonded parent imide. DFT calculations revealed: Formation of parent imide proceeds via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido unit with a computed pKBH+ of ca. &#8764;57, followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of nearby benzyl group across the anionic Hf&#8801;N bond. Reactivity studies of the anionic HfNH moiety are also presented.







Abstract
A dinuclear hafnium complex containing the parent imido ligand [(PN)(PNC)Hf=NH{&#956;2&#8208;K}]2 (2) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2; PNC2&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;CH2Me2C6H2), was prepared by reduction of the bisazide trans&#8208;[(PN)2Hf(N3)2] (1) with two equiv of KC8. Encapsulation of K+ in 2 with crown&#8208;ether or cryptand affords the first discrete salt [K(encap)][(PN)(PNC)Hf&#8801;NH] (encap=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6(THF)2, 3; 2,2,2&#8208;Kryptofix, 4), featuring a terminal parent imide and possessing some of the shortest Hf&#8722;N bond lengths known to date. DFT calculations revealed formation of 2 to proceed via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido, [(PN)2Hf&#8801;N]&#8722;(A), having a computed pKBH+ of &#8764;57 followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of a benzylic methyl group across the Hf&#8801;N triple bond in A. An electronic structure analysis reveals A to possess a covalent Hf&#8801;N triple bond and of super&#8208;basic character. We also showcase reactivity of the Hf&#8801;NH bond with various electrophiles.

         <title>Electronic Materials: An Antiaromatic Propeller Made from the Four&#8208;Fold Fusion of Tetraoxa[8]circulene and Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of an antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene annulated with four perylene diimides (PDI),&#160; giving a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, is described. The molecule contains 32 aromatic rings surrounding one formally antiaromatic planarized cyclooctatetraene (COT). The intense absorption (&#949; = 3.35 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) and emission bands are assigned to internal charge&#8208;transfer transitions in the combined PDI&#8208;circulene &#960;&#8208;system. The spectroscopic data is supported by density functional theory calculations, and nuclear independent chemical shift calculation indicate that the antiaromatic COT has increased aromaticity in the reduced state. Electrochemical studies show that the compound can reversibly reach the tetra&#8208; and octaanionic states by reduction of the four PDI units, and the decaanionic state by reduction of the central COT ring. The material functions effectively in bulk hetero junction solar cells as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 6.4 %.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Systemic 64 Membered Heparan Sulfate Tetrasaccharide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) has multifaceted biological activities. To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systemically varied sulfation structures are available yet due to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all the possible structures of 2&#8208;  O  , 6&#8208;  O  and  N  &#8208; sulfations with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a  single  strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 binding but weak affinity with platelet factor&#8208;4. This can provide a strategy to separate out these two interactions to obtain new HS based potential therapeutics   without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia  .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization is a useful strategy for the straightforward formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;Heteroatom bonds. In the present work, a unique approach for the challenging electrophilic Au&#8208;catalyzed  &#945;&#8208;  C&#8208;H bond functionalization of tertiary amines is presented. Electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects exerted by the use of a malonate unit in the substrate were key to the success of this transformation. This new reactivity was applied to the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products which, under oxidative conditions, could be converted into valuable structural motifs found in bioactive alkaloid natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework@Metal Oxide Heterostructures Induced by Electron&#8208;Beam Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a distinct family of crystalline porous materials finding extensive applications. Their synthesis often requires elevated temperature and relatively long reaction time. We report here the first case of MOF synthesis activated by high&#8208;energy (1.5 MeV) electron beam radiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. Using ZIF&#8208;8 as a representative for demonstration, this type of synthesis can be accomplished under ambient conditions within minutes, leading to energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal condition. Interestingly, by controlling the absorbed dose in the synthesis, the electron beam not only activates the formation reaction of ZIF&#8208;8, but also partially etches the material during the synthesis affording a hierarchical pore architecture and highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8. This gives rise to a new strategy to obtain MOF@metal oxide heterostructures, finding applications in photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Quadruple Borylation of Terminal Alkynes to Access sp3&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a copper catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). A wide range of terminal alkynes undergo this multi&#8208;borylation reaction to afford the corresponding 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes in high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential double 1,2diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates. This protocol represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approach to prepare  sp3&#8208;tetra&#8208;organometallic reagents from readily accessible alkynes with commercially available copper catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Heme Peroxo Oxidants in the Rational Mechanistic Modeling of Nitric Oxide Synthase: Characterization of Key Intermediates and Elucidation of the Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mediates the two&#8208;step O2  &#8208;dependent oxidative degradation of arginine, and has been linked to a medley of disease situations in humans. Nonetheless, its exact mechanism of action still remains unclear. This work presents the first NOS model system where biologically proposed heme superoxo and peroxo intermediates are assessed as active oxidants against oxime substrates. Markedly, heme peroxo intermediates engaged in a bioinspired oxime oxidation reaction pathway, converting oximes to ketones and nitroxyl anions (NO&#8211;). Detailed thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations all evince a rate&#8208;limiting step primarily driven by the nucleophilicity of the heme peroxo moiety. Coherent with other findings,  18O and  15N isotope substitution experiments herein suffice compelling evidence toward a detailed mechanism, which draw close parallels to one of the enzymatic proposals. Intriguingly, recent enzymatic studies also lend credence to these findings, and several relevant reaction intermediates have been observed during NOS turnover.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Cluster Nanospheres in Water&#8208;Deficient Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long&#8208;range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water&#8208;deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo&#8208;TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water&#8208;alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Copper&#8208;Zinc Alloy Layer Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode of Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable surface modification layer is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zinc (Zn) metal anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. Herein, a multicomponent Cu&#8208;Zn alloy interlayer with superior Zn affinity, high toughness and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn foil (Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn) to fabricate ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode. Owning to the advantages of high binding energy of Cu&#8208;Zn alloy layer with Zn atoms and less contact area between metallic Zn and electrolyte, the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances. Accordingly, the symmetric battery with Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn electrode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 5496 h at 1 mA cm  &#8722;2  for 1&#8201;mAh&#8201;cm  &#8722;2  , and the Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn//V  2  O  5  pouch cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88% after 600 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic Fe&#8208;N4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal&#8208;based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic Fe&#8208;N  4  sites within Fe&#8208;N&#8208;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active&#8208;site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn&#8208;to&#8208;Fe, are producing single&#8208;site M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N  4  cavities in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the reduced density of active site and their turn&#8208;over frequency.&#160;In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs is obtained and for single&#8208;site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible. This new approach surpasses limitations of methods that rely on probe molecules and, together with those techniques, offers a novel tool to unfold the complexity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst and M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cinereain and (&#8211;)&#8208;Janoxepin through a Fragment Coupling/Retro&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8211;)&#8208;janoxepin, two fungal cyclotripeptides featuring a complex heterocyclic core and interesting phytotoxic and antimalarial activities, have been achieved in a convergent manner. A key step in this synthesis is a one pot cascade initiated by the cyclocondensation of two fragments&#8212;a hindered 2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;acyl fluoride and an electron deficient cyclic amidine&#8212;to release a reactive spiro[2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1,5'&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;4',6'&#8208;dione]. This intermediate underwent a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement that was rationalized by DFT calculations. The cascade directly afforded a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product. In addition, the challenging oxepin ring was finally forged by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of an allylic fluoride intermediate. Beyond the development of these original transformations, this work contributes to the first achievement of the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8211;)&#8208;janoxepin.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Engineering toward Gold Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, both the core and shell have significant effects on catalytic properties. Thanks to their precise structures, the active metal site of the clusters can be readily identified and the ligand effects in catalysis can be disclosed. In this Minireview, we summarize recent advances in catalytic research of gold nanoclusters, emphasizing four strategies for constructing open metal sites, including post&#8208;treatment, bulky ligands strategy, surface geometric mismatch method and heteroatom doping protocol. We also discuss the ligand effects on catalytic activity, selectivity and stability of gold cluster catalysts. Finally, we present the future challenges with regard to gold cluster catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>FRET Monitoring of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Elongation Module Reveals Carrier Protein Shuttling Between Catalytic Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) employ multiple domains, specifically arranged in modules, for an assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis of a plethora of bioactive peptides. It is poorly understood how catalysis is correlated with the domain interplay and associated conformational changes. We developed FRET sensors of an elongation module to study in solution the intramodular interactions of the peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein (PCP) with adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains. Backed by a HDX&#8208;MS analysis, we discovered dynamic mixtures of conformations that undergo distinct population changes in favor of the PCP&#8208;A and PCP&#8208;C interactions upon completion of the adenylation and thiolation reactions, respectively. To probe this model we blocked PCP binding to the C domain by photocaging and triggered peptide bond formation with light. Changing intramodular domain affinities of the PCP appear to result in conformational shifts according to the logic of the templated assembly process.</dc:description>

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luciferin is one of Nature&#8217;s most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to firefly&#8217;s luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst &#8211; luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin&#8217;s electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in&#8208;situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Twisted Carbazole&#8208;Fused DABNA Derivative as an Orange&#8208;Red TADF Emitter for OLEDs with Nearly 40% EQE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is currently a research hotspot in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high color purity and high exciton utilization. However, there are only a handful of MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emissions beyond the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. The very limited emission colors for MR&#8208;TADF emitters are mainly caused by the fact that so far molecular modifications of MR&#8208;TADF do not offer much change in the emission colors. Here, we report a new approach to modifying a prototypical MR core of DABNA by fusing carbazoles to the MR framework. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule (TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA) basically maintains the MR&#8208;dominated features of DABNA while red&#8208;shifting the emission. Its OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 39.2% with a peak at 588 nm, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for OLEDs with peaks beyond 560 nm. This work provides a new approach for significantly tunning emission colors of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cleavage of C&#8208;P Bond: Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomers Containing a P&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;P bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful tool for the formation of both C&#8208;C and C&#8208;P bond. However, the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8208;P bond is still undeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8208;P bond for the construction of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines and stereogenic axis. This protocol enables the quick synthesis of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center in high yields, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of up to 98% ee, &gt;25:1 dr. The product is able to serve as chiral catalyst in phosphine catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, showing the great potential of the present methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Conjugation Tuning Carbon Nitride for Non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 Photosynthesis and Hypoxic Tumor Therapy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers downshifted the band position in a new carbon nitride that promoted water oxidation kinetics while avoiding thermodynamic photoreduction of H2. The material showed competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% for overall H2O2 production under normoxic conditions and record high activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1) for high&#8208;performance hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Artificial photocatalysis offers a clean approach for producing H2O2. However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 production in both normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating side H2 evolution reaction and kinetically promoting water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. The study sheds light on the photosynthesis of H2O2 by carbon nitrides for health applications.

         <title>Super Light&#8208;Sensitive Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Improved Photodynamic Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super light&#8208;sensitive photosensitizer nanoparticles are fabricated by the self&#8208;assembly of Rose Bengal and hemoglobin conjugates. The nanoparticles can increase the production of singlet oxygen upon irradiation with an exceptional ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). They can be easily internalized by cancers in deep tissues and exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment. However, the limited light intensity in tissues, tumor hypoxia, and the low accumulation efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs) in tumors are still major challenges. Herein, we introduce super light&#8208;sensitive PS nanoparticles (designated HR NPs) that can increase singlet oxygen (1O2) production and improve PS accumulation in tumors. HR NPs have the ability to produce a large amount of 1O2 under ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) irradiation. More significantly, HR NPs have a long circulating time in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and can accumulate in tumors with high efficiency. When irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength, the nanoparticles exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy. This work will make it possible to cure solid tumors by PDT by enhancing the therapeutic effects.

         <title>The Control of the Coordination Chemistry for the Genesis of Heterogeneous Catalytically Active Sites in Oxidation Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of coordination metal complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of fine chemicals is reviewed. Specific attention is paid to describing the phenomena leading to the genesis of the active sites, the clear characterization of the surface species, and their catalytic performance.







Abstract
This Review provides a summary of the use and the role of coordination complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation reactions of interest for fine chemical synthesis. Specific attention is paid to the comprehension of phenomena explaining the formation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts. Different families of coordination precursors are considered. For each example, a brief critical description of the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance is reported. Special attention is paid to the chemical environment of the first coordination sphere of the active metal centre. The catalysts obtained by heterogenization, grafting, or anchoring of homogeneous catalysts can therefore exhibit enhanced catalytic performance by merging advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The deposition of coordination complexes over a preformed support is indeed a conceptually versatile strategy to design novel catalysts with tuned and controlled properties.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Self&#8208;folding of Helical Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives in the Solid State Leading to Amplified Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives self&#8208;fold in the solid state into a non&#8208;uniform structure with sharp turns connecting stretched segments where the turns exhibit remarkable optical anisotropy in the ground state and in excited states.







Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;uniform self&#8208;folding of artificial polymer chains composed of turn moieties and stretched segments is presented through the design of a set of optically active poly(fluorene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) (poly(fluorenevinylene)) derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group attached at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene backbone at various ratios. The folded structure is formed and stabilized through inter&#8208;chain interactions in the solid state, leading to remarkably enhanced chiroptical properties (chirality amplification) in terms of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized light (CPL) emission. This phenomenon is rationalized by experimental and theoretical CD and CPL spectral analyses. The polymer arrangements in the solid state were further assessed through transmission electron microscopic observations combined with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations in the solid state revealing the thin film organizations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral and fluorescent supramolecular assemblies of graphene quantum dots were built by means of amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The structural features of the resultant materials were studied by a range of analytical and spectroscopic techniques, namely FTIR, XPS, absorption and emission spectroscopy and TGA.







Abstract
Dedicated to Prof. Miguel A. Alario on the occasion of his 80th birthday
The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interactions of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions in the Solid State using Compressible Macrocyclic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cavity compressing strategy is proposed to modulate the macrocyclic host&#8211;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions. The solid&#8208;state CT affinities of perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene toward various electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form.







Abstract
Modulating intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) interactions between specific donor and acceptor species in host&#8211;guest systems is a big challenge and full of research value in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, a strategy to modulate the supramolecular ICT interactions in the solid state is developed by compressing the binding cavity of a macrocyclic host named perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene (p&#8208;EtLP6). The solid&#8208;state ICT affinities of p&#8208;EtLP6 toward multi&#8208;types of electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form (m&#8208;EtLP6). X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses incorporating theoretical calculation demonstrate that the improved ICT affinities are mainly attributed to the superior host&#8211;guest size fit arising from the compressed binding cavity in m&#8208;EtLP6 as compared with p&#8208;EtLP6.

         <title>Morphology and Light&#8208;Dependent Spatial Distribution of Spin Defects in Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radicals in carbon nitride are invoked as photocatalytically competent species. However, their structure and localisation is ill&#8208;defined. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of speciation, electronic structure, long&#8208;range distributions and photo&#8208;response of such radicals, as a function of carbon nitride morphology. This work paves the way to the engineering of the defective structure of carbon nitride and related 2D materials.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN) is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that combines good structural properties and a broad scope. The photocatalytic efficiency of CN is associated with the presence of defective and radical species. An accurate description of defective states&#8212;both at a local and extended level&#8212;is key to develop a thorough mechanistic understanding of the photophysics of CN. In turn, this will maximise the generation and usage of photogenerated charge carriers and minimise wasteful charge recombination. Here the influence of morphology and light&#8208;excitation on the number and chemical nature of radical defects is assessed. By exploiting the magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole coupling, the spatial distribution of native radicals in CN is derived with high precision. From the analysis an average distance in the range 1.99&#8211;2.34&#8197;nm is determined, which corresponds to pairs of radicals located approximately four tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units apart.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with tubular channels were prepared by self&#8208;assembly followed by UV irraiation of amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes in aqueous solution. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling and colorimetric DNA sensing was demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets.







Abstract
Creation of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH2 containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO).

         <title>An Anticancer Rhenium Tricarbonyl Targets Fe&#8722;S Cluster Biogenesis in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomic approach to inorganic drug discovery improves the prioritization of candidate drug targets and revealed the scaffold protein NUBP2 involved in Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis as a relevant target for the rhenium tricarbonyl TRIP. This approach efficiently deconvolutes the polypharmacology of metal&#8208;based drug candidates and may be generally applied.







Abstract
Target identification remains a critical challenge in inorganic drug discovery to deconvolute potential polypharmacology. Herein, we describe an improved approach to prioritize candidate protein targets based on a combination of dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomics and treatment effects in living cancer cells for the rhenium tricarbonyl compound TRIP. Chemoproteomics revealed 89 distinct dose&#8208;dependent targets with concentrations of competitive saturation between 0.1 and 32&#8197;&#956;M despite the broad proteotoxic effects of TRIP. Target&#8208;response networks revealed two highly probable targets of which the Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis factor NUBP2 was competitively saturated by free TRIP at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, TRIP treatment led to a down&#8208;regulation of Fe&#8722;S cluster containing proteins and upregulated ferritin. Fe&#8722;S cluster depletion was further verified by assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consequently, TRIP emerges as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class modulator of the scaffold protein NUBP2, which disturbs Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis at sub&#8208;cytotoxic concentrations in ovarian cancer cells.

         <title>Unusual Quartet&#8208;Doublet Phosphorescence from the Phosphaethynyl Radical, CP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CP is generated by photolysis of phosphaethyne (HCP) isolated in solid argon. Phosphorescence of the radical, observed after the B2&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ photoexcitation, is assisted by an intersystem crossing from B2&#931;+ to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Intense, well&#8208;resolved vibronic progressions were traced for a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#1055;i emission systems. Phosphorescence lifetime is on the order of 0.1&#8197;s.







Abstract
We report the first detection of phosphorescence from the phosphaethynyl radical. This rare instance of quartet&#8208;doublet emission, studied here in solid argon, is presumably promoted by efficient intersystem crossing from the originally photoexcited doublet (B2&#931;+) to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Vibronic progressions were traced for the a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#1055;i systems from their origins up to (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=5) and (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=2) bands, respectively. The measured phosphorescence lifetime is 108 &#177; 3&#8197;ms.

         <title>Maximized Green Photoluminescence in Tb&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Pressure&#8208;Treated Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks are of interest in the development of photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their&#160;structural tunability and intrinsic features of lanthanide elements. However, there exists some limitations arising from poor matching&#160;with metal ions, thereby exhibiting a weak ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Here we demonstrate a pressure&#8208;treated strategy for achieving high PL performance in green&#8208;emitting Tb(BTC)(H2O)6. The photoluminescence quantum yield of pressure&#8208;treated sample increased from 50.6% to 90.4%. We found that the&#160;enhanced hydrogen bonds locked the conjugated configuration formed by two planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive LMET. Moreover, the optimized singlet and triplet states also validated the facilitated LMET process. This work opens the opportunity of structure&#160;optimization to improve PL performance in MOFs by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3 + 2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Donicity of Liquid electrolytes for Lithium Carbon Fluoride Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy powers have greatly incentivized the development of lithium carbon fluoride (Li || CF  x  ) cells. Five kinds of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes with various kinds of lithium salts (LiX, X = PF  6  &#8722;  , TFSI  &#8722;  , BF  4  &#8722;  , ClO  4  &#8722;  , and CF  3  SO  3  &#8722;  ) were comparatively studied. Intriguingly, the LiBF  4  &#8208;based electrolyte show relatively moderate ionic conductivities; yet, the corresponding Li || CF  x  cells deliver the highest discharge capacities among them. A combination of morphological and compositional analyses of the discharge CF  x  cathode suggest that the moderate donicity of BF  4  &#8722;  anion is accountable for favoring the breakdown of C&#8722;F bonds, and subsequently forming crystalline lithium fluoride as the main discharge products. This work brings not only fresh understanding on the role of salt anions for Li || CF  x  cells, but also inspire the electrolyte design for other conversion&#8208;type (sulfur and/or organosulfur) cathode materials desired for high&#8208;energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous N&#8208;rich Carbon with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, a NH4Cl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is developed to fabricate highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon (designed as NC(p)) featuring thin outer shells and porous inner networks, on which single&#8208;Ni atoms are anchored to form an excellent sulfur host (designed as Ni&#8208;NC(p)) for Li&#8208;S batteries. During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF&#8208;8 will in situ etch ZIF&#8208;8 to produce rich mesopores in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni&#8208;NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single&#8208;Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni&#8208;NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li&#8208;S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated  in situ  ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8208;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize  C  &#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Support Modulates the Microenvironment of Pd Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While exposed support facet of supported catalysts plays a crucial role in catalysis, this is usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured ZIF&#8208;8x@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 composites (X represents the morphology of ZIF&#8208;8 core, including ZIF&#8208;8C  exposing (100) facet, ZIF&#8208;8RD  exposing (110) facet, and ZIF&#8208;8TRD  exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring small Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF&#8208;8 core, are rationally fabricated for hydrogenation of  p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. Remarkably, the Pd electronic state is tailored by ZIF&#8208;8 core, where more electron&#8208;deficient Pd is found in ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 than that in ZIF&#8208;8RD@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, leading to discriminative adsorption of &#8211;NO2  and &#8211;Cl group of  p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. As a result, the ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit excellent activity (97.6%) and selectivity (98.1%) to  p&#8208;chloroaniline, far superior to other counterparts. This work highlights crystal facet engineering of supports for modulating microenvironment and electronic state of supported metal nanoparticles, offering a promising avenue to enhanced catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, thiol&#8208;Michael exchange, Diels&#8208;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this review suggests how to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials though both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Metal Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework MFM&#8208;300(Sc): Lewis Acid Catalysis Driven by Metal&#8208;Hemilabile Linker Bond Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncommon reversible guest&#8208;induced metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond dynamics in the MOF MFM&#8208;300(Sc) was unraveled to switch on/switch off catalytic open metal sites. The catalytic activity of this MOF with non&#8208;permanent open metal sites was demonstrated using a model Strecker hydrocyanation reaction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Conclusively, the catalytic activity was evidenced to be fully reversible, preserving the conversion performance and structure integrity of MFM&#8208;300(Sc) over multiple cycles. These experimental findings were corroborated by quantum&#8208;calculations that revealed a reaction mechanism driven by the Sc&#8208;open metal sites. This discovery paves the way towards the design of new effective and easily regenerable heterogeneous MOF catalysts integrating switchable metal sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles using Visible&#8208;Light Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that both undergo isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, allowing for control of the number of monomers involved in cyclo&#8208;oligomerization, which were investigated using 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/VIS spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic optimization of the elementary steps of water dissociation and hydrogen desorption for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is challenge but it is vital. Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P&#8208;doped defective TiO  2  substrate (Ru/P&#8208;TiO  2  ) was synthesized as an excellent electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C&#8208;like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3 mA mg  Ru  &#8208;1  at &#8208;0.05 V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO  2  , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutileTiO  2  &#8208;crystal&#8208;phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutileTiO  2  facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti  4+  with P  5+  enhanced H  2  generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.</dc:description>

Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an important strategy for developing new reactions in stereodivergent synthesis. This strategy is also a simple and powerful approach for synthesizing all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters from the same set of starting materials. This Minireview summarizes recent progress and briefly gives perspectives for the future advancement of this field.







Abstract
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Analysis of Anionic Coordination Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative&#8208;ion mode ESI mass spectrometry permits the direct observation of anionic polymers resulting from the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with CoCl2 and organolithium reagents.







Abstract
Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes initiated by CoCl2/RLi (R=Me, nBu, tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR&#8208;spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass&#8208;spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and High&#8208;Yielding Fluorination of Highly Basic Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>

         <dc:description>
By developing a sterically hindered fluorinating agent, N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved an unprecedented high&#8208;yield fluorination of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species.







Abstract
Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8722;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic polymers block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids giving an efficient protein and peptide encapsulation. Profiting from the high mass fraction of therapeutics (58.3&#8197;wt%), the mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times lower than that with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones. One injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites held the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
The control of cargo phase&#8208;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Herein, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright, forming a thick three&#8208;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8208;water interface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly prevented the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1&#8201;%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites (58.3&#8197;wt%) kept the blood glucose level within the normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days in type&#8197;1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene nanosheets introduced to SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells maximize the interface matching between SnO2 and perovskite and induce vertically aligned crystal growth. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved by 15&#8201;%, reaching 23.07&#8201;%, and the short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, an unencapsulated device maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 500&#8197;h of storage in ambient air.







Abstract
Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15&#8201;% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after 500&#8197;h of storage at 30&#8211;40&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.

         <title>Reductive Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;Bond Formation in Alumaboranes: Facile Scission of Polar Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of rare Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bonds is facilitated employing a peri&#8208;AlI2/BMes2 naphthalene scaffold, which upon reduction forms an alumaborane diethyl ether adduct. Reagents with polar multiple bonds (C=O, C&#8801;N, C=S) undergo complete scission with insertion of the heteroatom into Al&#8722;B bond. The findings help to understand the differences between Al&#8722;C bonds widely employed in aluminum organyls and scarcely studied alumaboranes with Al&#8722;B bonds.







Abstract
We present facile access to an alumaborane species with electron precise Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The reductive rearrangement of 1&#8208;(AlI2), 8&#8208;(BMes2) naphthalene (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) affords the alumaborane species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)(OEt2)&#8208;8&#8208;B(Mes)] with a covalent Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond performs the reductive scission of multiple bonds: S=C(NiPrCMe)2 affords the naphthalene bridged motif B&#8722;S&#8722;Al(NHC), NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, while O=CPh2 is deoxygenated to afford an B&#8722;O&#8722;Al bridged species with incorporation of the remaining &#8801;CPh2 fragment into the naphthalene scaffold. The reaction with isonitrile Xyl&#8208;N&#8801;C (Xyl=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H4) proceeds via a proposed (amino boryl) carbene species; which adds a second equivalent of isonitrile to ultimately form the Al&#8722;N&#8722;B bridged species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)&#8208;N(Xyl)&#8208;8&#8208;B{C(Mes)=C&#8722;N&#8722;Xyl}] with complete scission of the C&#8801;N triple bond. The latter reaction is supported with isolated intermediates and by DFT calculations.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Indium&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed In&#8722;Cu metal pairs anchored on polymeric carbon nitride catalysts (InCu/PCN) were designed and produced by a facile thermal polymerization approach to support photocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol. The metal pairs exert synergistic interactions that enhance the activity and adsorption of metal sites to promote C&#8722;C coupling and subsequent formation of ethanol.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 to C2+ solar fuel is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. This strategy is challenged by its low productivity due to low efficiency in multielectron utilization and slow C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. This work reports a dual&#8208;metal photocatalyst consisting of atomically dispersed indium and copper anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (InCu/PCN), on which the photoreduction of CO2 delivered an excellent ethanol production rate of 28.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 92&#8201;%. Coupled experimental investigation and DFT calculations reveal the following mechanisms underpinning the high performance of this catalyst. Essentially, the In&#8722;Cu interaction enhances the charge separation by accelerating charge transfer from PCN to the metal sites. Indium also transfers electrons to neighboring copper via Cu&#8722;N&#8722;In bridges, increasing the electron density of copper active sites. Furthermore, In&#8722;Cu dual&#8208;metal sites promote the adsorption of *CO intermediates and lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Controlling the Transition of Nanospheres to Superhelices in Aqueous Media by Using a &#8220;Smart&#8221; Pyrazine Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy to control the supramolecular chirality and morphology of co&#8208;assembled architecture of Pyra&#8208;Met in the presence of Au3+ ions and L&#8208;methionine in aqueous media has been described by fine tailoring of the chiral handle of the pyrazine building block.







Abstract
For the development of nature&#8208;inspired chiral nanostructures, controlling the chirality communication along the assembling pathways in aqueous media is a crucial task. Herein, we designed and synthesized pyrazine&#8208;based derivative Pyra&#8208;Met with an L&#8208;methionine group as a chiral handle. Due to the presence of flexible side chains in the Pyra&#8208;Met building block, its interactions with the solvent molecules in the assembled state are restricted, which leads to the generation of nanospheres in aqueous media. The Pyra&#8208;Met nanospheres selectively interact with Au3+ ions to generate dynamic helical fibers of the Pyra&#8208;Met:Au3+ ensemble with &#8216;hidden&#8217; chirality. Finally, superhelices with the desired helical sense are achieved in the presence of L/D&#8208;methionine via a co&#8208;assembly process. This work presents a feasible strategy to achieve the desired handedness of supramolecular assemblies for better understanding of chirality translation in supramolecular chemistry and it highlights the importance of fine tailoring of building block to control the morphology of the assembled architecture.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Ubiquitin&#8208;like Protein ISG15 Tools through Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Ligation Catalyzed by a Viral Protease Lbpro</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>

A protease (Lbpro) from foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can ligate synthetic glycyl compounds to ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15), generating various ISG15 protein tools for cellular proteomic studies, as well as screening and evaluation of small molecules against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). This strategy can also synthesize ISG15&#8208;modified peptide and Ub (ubiquitin)/NEDD8 (ubiquitin&#8208;like protein Nedd8) protein tools.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;like protein ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15) regulates innate immunity and links with the evasion of host response by viruses such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Dissecting ISGylation pathways recently received increasing attention which can inform related disease interventions, but such studies necessitate the preparation and development of various ISG15 protein tools. Here, we find that the leader protease (Lbpro) encoded by foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can promote ligation reactions between recombinant ISG15 and synthetic glycyl compounds, generating protein tools such as ISG15&#8208;propargylamide and ISG15&#8208;rhodamine110, which are needed for cellular proteomic studies of deISGylases, and the screening and evaluation of inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). Furthermore, this strategy can be also used to load ISG15 onto the lysine of a synthetic peptide through an isopeptide bond, and prepare Ub and NEDD8 (ubiquitin&#8208;like protein Nedd8) protein tools.

         <title>Unblocking Ion&#8208;occluded Pore Channels in Poly(triazine imide) Framework for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride with nanoporous framework. However, pores in PTI are blocked by Li+ and halide ions, and a complete removal of ions leads to an impermeable AB stacking. We report an ion&#8208;exchange route which tunably opens pore channels while maintaining the AA&#8242; configuration leading to an improved proton conductivity.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;&#8208;scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;&#8208;stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion&#8208;free PTI hosting AB&#8208;stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport. Herein, we demonstrate acid treatment for ion depletion which maintains AA&#8217; stacking and results in open pore structure. We provide first direct evidence of ion&#8208;depleted open pores by imaging with the atomic resolution using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the extent of ion&#8208;exchange, AA&#8217; stacking with open channels and AB stacking with closed channels are obtained and imaged for the first time. The accessibility of open channels is demonstrated by enhanced proton transport through ion depleted PTI.

         <title>Transmembrane Shuttling of Photosynthetically Produced Electrons to Propel Extracellular Biocatalytic Redox Reactions in a Modular Fashion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is utilized as benign electron&#8208;donor in photosynthesis, e.g. by cyanobacteria. Herein, a novel approach to shuttle them through the cyanobacterium's cell&#8208;membrane and to utilize them for extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions is presented. The concept was demonstrated for 19 different reductive and oxidative enzymes from 4 different classes.







Abstract
Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH&#8208;regeneration as it is performed, e.g. by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time&#8208;consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions. The modular photo&#8208;electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme&#8208; or substrate&#8208;toxicity and substrate uptake. The MPS was demonstrated on four classes of enzymes with 19 enzymes and various types of substrates, reaching conversions of up to 99&#8201;% and giving products with &gt;99&#8201;% optical purity.

         <title>Stereogradient Poly(Lactic Acid) from meso&#8208;Lactide/L&#8208;Lactide Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization of meso&#8208;lactide/L&#8208;lactide mixtures was carried out at 180&#8201;&#176;C by employing a highly syndioselective catalyst based on a zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand. Stereogradient copolymers that exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers were obtained with the industrial catalyst.







Abstract
The production of L&#8208;lactide from L&#8208;lactic acid involves a substantial formation of meso&#8208;lactide as an impurity, and, upon polymerization with the industrial catalyst tin octanoate, results in poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) of reduced crystallinity due to stereoerrors randomly distributed along the polymer chains. We describe a new approach wherein, instead of avoiding stereoerrors by removing the meso&#8208;lactide prior to polymerization, the stereoerrors in the polymer are tolerated, by crowding them in a stereogradient copolymer. A zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand is found to exhibit very high syndioselectivity in the ring opening polymerization catalysis of meso&#8208;lactide at room temperature, and gives rise to stereogradient copolymers in the polymerization of mixtures of meso&#8208;lactide/L&#8208;lactide in the melt at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers obtained with tin octanoate, the stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities manifested in lower solubilities and higher melting temperatures and enthalpies.

         <title>P and Cu Dual Sites on Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbon Fuels with High C2H6 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu and P dual sites were constructed in carbon nitride matrix for achieving highly efficient separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Benefiting from the unique dual sites structure, P/Cu SAs@CN exhibited outstanding photocatalytic CO2 conversion to C2H6.







Abstract
The light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products is especially meaningful, while the low efficiency of multi&#8208;electron transfer and sluggish C&#8722;C coupling greatly hinder its development. Herein, we report a photocatalyst comprising of P and Cu dual sites anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (P/Cu SAs@CN), which achieves a high C2H6 evolution rate of 616.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons. The detailed spectroscopic characterizations identify the formation of charge&#8208;enriched Cu sites, where the isolated P atoms serve as hole capture sites during photocatalysis. Theoretical simulations combined with in situ FTIR measurement reveal a kinetically feasible process for the formation of C&#8722;C coupling intermediate (*OC&#8722;COH) and confirm the favorable production of C2H6 on the P/Cu SAs@CN photocatalyst. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design with atomic precision toward highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion to high value&#8208;added carbon products.

The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures is achieved for the first time. In photocatalytic H2 production, the 2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF shows a unique &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;hybrid&#8221; effect, which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;identical&#8221; 2D, 3D, and 3D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF structures.







Abstract
A MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure is attractive in material science because of its potential combined effects in catalysis. However, precisely controlling the growth pattern at the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nucleation stage to manipulate the metallic composition and structure dimensionality remain a challenge. Herein, we introduce a polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;assist kinetic&#8208;control strategy to achieve the &#8220;anti&#8208;epitaxial growth&#8221; pattern of a foreign MOF nucleus on the (111) facets of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 octahedron seeds, and construct diverse two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D) MOF heterostructures (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, and Ni). Notably, the 2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D Cu exhibits a unique &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;hybrid&#8221; effect in photocatalysis which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;identical&#8221; 2D, 3D and 3D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF structures.

In photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, the 2D-on-3D MOF shows a unique &#8220;dimensionality-hybrid&#8221; effect, which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality-identical&#8221; 2D, 3D, and 3D-on-3D MOF structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MOF-on-MOF heterostructure is attractive in material science because of its potential combined effects in catalysis. However, precisely controlling the growth pattern at the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nucleation stage to manipulate the metallic composition and structure dimensionality remain a challenge. Herein, we introduce a polyvinylpyrrolidone-assist kinetic-control strategy to achieve the &#8220;anti-epitaxial growth&#8221; pattern of a foreign MOF nucleus on the (111) facets of UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron seeds, and construct diverse two-dimensional-on-three-dimensional (2D-on-3D) MOF heterostructures (2D-on-3D Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, and Ni). Notably, the 2D-on-3D Cu exhibits a unique &#8220;dimensionality-hybrid&#8221; effect in photocatalysis which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality-identical&#8221; 2D, 3D and 3D-on-3D MOF structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanistic Pathway of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Driven by a Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoI complex bearing a redox&#8208;active &#954;&#8208;N3P2 pentadentate ligand and its activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction is reported in this work. A combination of spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational techniques is employed to characterize the intermediate species, demonstrating an unusual homolytic coupling reaction pathway between two catalyst units.







Abstract
A cobalt complex bearing a &#954;&#8208;N3P2 ligand is presented (1+ or CoI(L), where L is (1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(3&#8208;(diphenylphosphanyl)propyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine). Complex 1+ is stable under air at oxidation state CoI thanks to the &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the phosphine groups. Electrochemical behavior of 1+ reveals a two&#8208;electron CoI/CoIII oxidation process and an additional one&#8208;electron reduction, which leads to an enhancement in the current due to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at Eonset=&#8722;1.6&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+. In the presence of 1&#8197;equiv of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, 1+ forms the cobalt hydride derivative CoIII(L)&#8208;H (22+), which has been fully characterized. Further addition of 1&#8197;equiv of CoCp*2 (Cp* is pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) affords the reduced CoII(L)&#8208;H (2+) species, which rapidly forms hydrogen and regenerates the initial CoI(L) (1+). The spectroscopic characterization of catalytic intermediates together with DFT calculations support an unusual bimolecular homolytic mechanism in the catalytic HER with 1+.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Theranostic Prodrug with Self&#8208;Sustainable Magnification Effect of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a theranostic prodrug that could self&#8208;report the drug release, immunogenic cell death (ICD) progression, and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation with activated near&#8208;infrared afterglow chemiluminescence. Such an intelligent prodrug also shows a unique self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect, completely eradicating the existing tumor and preventing further tumor recurrence through enhanced antitumor immune response.







Abstract
Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow theranostic prodrug that circumvents high background noise interference caused by external light excitation. The prodrug can release hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in response to the high intratumoral peroxynitrite level associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), and synchronously activate afterglow signal to monitor the drug release process and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation. The prodrug itself is an ICD inducer achieved by photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT initiates ICD and recruits first&#8208;arrived neutrophils to secrete peroxynitrite to trigger HCPT release. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that HCPT can significantly amplify PDT&#8208;mediated ICD process. The prodrug thus shows a self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect by establishing an &#8220;ICD&#8208;HCPT release&#8208;amplified ICD&#8221; cycling loop. In vivo studies demonstrate that the prodrug can eradicate existing tumors and prevent further tumor recurrence through antitumor immune response.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salt for Ultrarapid Adsorption/Desorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting by Dual Hydrogen Bond System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we explored the application of crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs) in atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) for the first time and synthesized a novel CPOS (CPOS&#8208;6), which showed excellent AWH performance attributed to its unique dual hydrogen bond system.







Abstract
In recent years, the porous sorbent&#8208;assisted atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) method has emerged as an effective approach for solving water crises without geographical restrictions. However, there is a limited array of porous adsorbent materials that can be used for AWH, which are inadequate to meet the needs under different climatic conditions. In light of this, herein, we synthesize a new crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS; denoted as CPOS&#8208;6) possessing a dual hydrogen bond system and verify its applicability toward AWH for the first time. Unlike other reported CPOSs, CPOS&#8208;6 displays an S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherm owing to the presence of the dual hydrogen bond system. Under simulated drought conditions in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, CPOS&#8208;6 exhibits long&#8208;term water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycling stability, low water desorption temperature, and ultrarapid adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics. The results confirm that CPOS&#8208;6 is an effective sorbent material for AWH.

         <title>Alloying at a Subnanoscale Maximizes the Synergistic Effect on the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase separation in nanoparticles is undesirable from the viewpoint of the synergistic effects between elements in catalytic applications. Here, we propose the general concept that subnanoparticles are not phase&#8208;separated and are an effective means for the expression of elemental synergies.







Abstract
Bonding dissimilar elements to provide synergistic effects is an effective way to improve the performance of metal catalysts. However, as the properties become more dissimilar, achieving synergistic effects effectively becomes more difficult due to phase separation. Here we describe a comprehensive study on how subnanoscale alloying is always effective for inter&#8208;elemental synergy. Thirty&#8208;six combinations of both bimetallic subnanoparticles (SNPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) were studied systematically using atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and catalyst benchmarking based on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results revealed that SNPs always produce greater synergistic effects than NPs, the greatest synergistic effect was found for the combination of Pt and Zr. The atomic&#8208;scale miscibility and the associated modulation of electronic states at the subnanoscale were much different from those at the nanoscale, which was observed by annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively.

         <title>Formation of a Strong Heterogeneous Aluminum Lewis Acid on Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al(OC(CF3)3)3(PhF) reacts with partially dehydroxylated silica to form very strong Lewis acid sites. The well&#8208;defined aluminum Lewis acids are significantly stronger than common molecular Lewis acids and engage in alkyl abstraction reactions that are uncommon using well&#8208;defined supported Lewis acids.







Abstract
Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) reacts with silanols present on partially dehydroxylated silica to form well&#8208;defined &#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(O(Si&#8801;)2) (1). 27Al&#8197;NMR and DFT calculations with a small cluster model to approximate the silica surface show that the aluminum in 1 adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry by coordinating to a nearby siloxane bridge and a fluorine from the alkoxide. Fluoride ion affinity (FIA) calculations follow experimental trends and show that 1 is a stronger Lewis acid than B(C6F5)3 and Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) but is weaker than Al(OC(CF3)3) and iPr3Si+. Cp2Zr(CH3)2 reacts with 1 to form [Cp2ZrCH3][&#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(CH3)] (3) by methide abstraction. This reactivity pattern is similar to reactions of organometallics with the proposed strong Lewis acid sites present on Al2O3.

         <title>Construction of Perylene&#8208;based Amphiphilic Micelle and Its Efficient Adsorption and In Situ Photodegradation of Bisphenol A in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new idea of designing self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic micelles containing photo&#8208;functional perylene blocks for &#8220;selective adsorption/catalytic degradation&#8221; of bisphenol A (BPA) has been put forward. The results show that the micelles possess high mass&#8208;transfer efficiency with ultrafast adsorption rate (within 10&#8197;s), high adsorption capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high selectivity for BPA, which greatly improves the BPA photodegradation efficiency.







Abstract
Low mass&#8208;transfer efficiency and reaction&#8208;driving force make it difficult to realize thorough purification in traditional low&#8208;concentration pollutant treatments. Herein, we propose an &#8220;adsorption/catalysis in situ&#8221; perylene based bifunctional micelle for efficient, accurate and rapid adsorption and catalytic degradation of low&#8208;concentration bisphenol A (BPA). They show super&#8208;fast (within 10&#8197;s), high capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and selectivity for BPA adsorption, due to &#960;&#8211;&#960;, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The BPA degradation efficiency improves by up to 8&#8197;times after forming micelles compared with simple perylene nanorods, which is primarily due to the superior mass&#8208;transfer from adsorption. Moreover, self&#8208;assembly can optimize the stacking of the perylene moieties and facilitate charge transfer in micelle, and the regular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of inside perylene units enhances the response to visible light, resulting in high catalytic capacity and good cycling stability.

         <title>Nearly&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield and 12&#8208;Hour Afterglow from a Transparent Perovskite of Cs2NaScCl6:Tb</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent Cs2NaSc1&#8722;xCl6:xTb3+ single crystals with ca. 98.2&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) were grown by a hydrothermal method. The doped crystal exhibited an intense green afterglow of 12&#8197;hours upon ceasing the X&#8208;ray excitation. Based on this improved output of the transparent crystals, a radiation&#8208;storage battery was designed, which has a linear&#8208;scaling capacity with loading weight.







Abstract
Unlike afterglow phosphors, transparent crystals free of scattering issues hold great potential in applications such as volumetric displays and three&#8208;dimensional encryption. Here, a double&#8208;perovskite host of ca. 85&#8201;% transparency, a Cs2NaScCl6 single crystal, was grown in aqueous solution. Through heavy doping of Tb ions, the crystal exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) up to 98.2&#8201;%. Both steady&#8208;state and transient PL spectroscopic investigation revealed a cross&#8208;relaxation efficiency (&#951;CR&#8776;99&#8201;%) between Tb ions, greatly mitigated the electron saturation on the 5D3 level and encouraged the radiative route against quenching. The doped crystal displayed an intense afterglow of up to 12&#8197;h after ceasing the X&#8208;ray excitation, allowing it to be used in a radiation&#8208;storage battery which has a linear scaling capacity with loading weight. Our work opens possibilities in photo&#8208;stimulated volumetric display and three&#8208;dimensional information storage.

         <title>Efficient Gene Silencing in Intact Plant Cells Using siRNA Delivered By Functional Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) can be used to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) into intact plant cells by forming a small, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex. The GONs&#8208;siRNA complex could cross the intact cell wall and internalize into plant cells, resulting in highly efficient and transient gene silencing. This provides an efficient, transient, simple, and safe strategy for plant gene engineering.







Abstract
Delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to intact plants for gene silencing mainly relies on viral vectors and Agrobacterium&#8208;mediated transformation due to the barrier of intact plant cell wall. Here, we reported that polymer functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) enable siRNA transfer into intact plant cells and bring about efficient gene silencing. We found that sheeted GONs could efficiently load siRNA to form small sized, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex, which could be across the cell wall and internalize in the plant cell. The GONs&#8208;siRNA exhibited transient and strong silencing (97.2&#8201;% efficiency) in plant tissues at 24&#8197;h after treatment and returned to normal level at 5&#8197;days after treatment. This method has the obvious advantages of efficient, transient, simple, stability and well biocompatibility, which should greatly stimulate the application of nanomaterials as gene&#8208;engineering tools in plant research.

         <title>A Porphyrin&#8208;Based Organic Network Comprising Sustainable Carbon Dots for Photopolymerization</title>

         <dc:description>
Alder&#8208;Longo reaction between aldehyde groups of CDs based on furfuraldehyde (F&#8208;CDs) and dipyrrolo methane results in porphyrin patterns connecting the F&#8208;CDs. This gives a light&#8208;sensitive organic network. This can initiate photopolymerization following a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol upon 405 LED excitation. End&#8208;group fidelity was shown by block polymerization where CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8722;, and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst resulted in formation of polymer.

Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) based on furfuraldehyde (F&#8208;CD) resulted in a photosensitive material after pursuing the Alder&#8208;Longo reaction. The porphyrin moiety formed connects the F&#8208;CDs in a covalent organic network. This heterogeneous material (P&#8208;CD) was characterized by XPS indicating incorporation of the respective C, N and O moieties. Time resolved fluorescence including global analysis showed contribution of three linked components to the overall dynamics of the excited state. Electrochemical and photonic properties of this heterogeneous material facilitated photopolymerization in a photo&#8208;ATRP setup where either CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8722; or a metal free reaction setup activated controlled polymerization. Chain extension experiments worked in all three cases showing end group fidelity for activation of controlled block copolymerization using MMA and styrene as monomers. Traditional radical polymerization using a diaryl iodonium salt as co&#8208;initiator failed.

&lt;p&gt;Alder-Longo reaction between aldehyde groups of &lt;b&gt;CD&lt;/b&gt;s based on furfuraldehyde (F-&lt;b&gt;CD&lt;/b&gt;s) and dipyrrolo methane results in porphyrin patterns connecting the F-&lt;b&gt;CD&lt;/b&gt;s. This gives a light-sensitive organic network. This can initiate photopolymerization following a photo-ATRP protocol upon 405 LED excitation. End-group fidelity was shown by block polymerization where CuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TPMA, FeBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and a metal-free photocatalyst resulted in formation of polymer.

We disclose photocyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension as an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped molecular ribbons. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including two isomers with the C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons were synthesized, and their contorted topological conformations, photochromism behaviors and electronic properties were demonstrated.







Abstract
Molecular ribbons (MRs), one&#8208;dimentional topological polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of importance for synthetic chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we disclose an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped MRs, i.e. photochemical cyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped PAHs that own multiple cove edges were synthesized using Mallory photoreaction in solution. Two of them feature isomeric C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons with 2.2&#8197;nm in length, thus representing a new kind of boron&#8208;doped MRs. The boron atoms endow them with sufficient Lewis acidity, and notably, the formed Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts based on boron&#8208;doped MRs display the photo&#8208;induced dual&#8208;dissociation behavior in the excited state and thus photochromism property. Moreover, despite of the highly contorted topological conformations, their potential utility as organic semiconductor was demonstrated by fabrication of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Unshared Pair Electrons of Zincophilic Lewis Base Enable Long&#8208;life Zn Anodes under &#8220;Three High&#8221; Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy by introducing Lewis basic solvent additive with unshared pair electrons in electrolyte is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefitting from the zincophilic feature and unique electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristic of Lewis basic unshared pair electrons, the designed electrolytes promote the Coulombic efficiency and lifespan in both Zn symmetric and full cells at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and dendrite issues are the notorious culprits of the limited lifespan and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn anodes, particularly at harsh test conditions. Herein, considering the Lewis acidic feature of Zn2+, abundant unshared pair electrons of zincophilic Lewis bases are proposed as decent electrolyte additives to stabilize Zn anodes at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions (high depth of discharge, high areal capacity and high current). The unshared pair electrons can remove H2O from Zn2+ solvated sheaths and confine the activity of H2O by breaking its hydrogen bonding network. The combination of these factors effectively restricts H2O&#8208;involved side reactions and enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, even at harsh conditions. The effectiveness of this strategy is fully proved by a series of Lewis base molecules. Noticeably, the Zn||Zn cell with an area of 20&#8197;cm2, using DMF&#8208;containing electrolyte can be stably cycled over 1000&#8197;h at 60&#8201;% DOD, with a 100&#8201;% CE.

A chiral all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted VQM is generated by chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed nucleophilic addition of 2&#8208;alkynylnaphthols to o&#8208;quinone methides or imines, and it can be captured intramolecularly by a cycloaddition reaction. A wide range of naphthyl&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes bearing axially and centrally chiral elements and axially chiral quinone&#8208;naphthols were prepared efficiently with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract

A new class of naphthyl&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes bearing axially and centrally chiral elements and axially chiral quinone&#8208;naphthols were prepared efficiently with good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities. Noteworthy, the enantioselective cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with o&#8208;quinone methides proceeded via a [2+2] cycloaddition, followed by a retro&#8208;4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and a 6&#960; re&#8208;cyclization. While the cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with imines proceeded via a sequential [2+4] cycloaddition and an auto oxidation reaction. Moreover, the obtained axially chiral naphthols can be converted into valuable phosphine ligands and other functional molecules.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Effects for the Regioselective Zincation of Diazines Using TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (X=Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important N&#8208;heterocycles such as pyrimidines were regioselectively zincated using bimetallic bases of type TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br) and subsequently quenched with electrophiles. Trapping of key organometallic intermediates has shed light on their complex solution constitution and helped to explain the high regioselectivity observed as well as the stoichiometry of the base used.







Abstract
A new method for regioselective zincations of challenging N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates such as pyrimidines and pyridazine was reported using bimetallic bases TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br). Reactions occurred under mild conditions (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, using 1.75 equivalents of base without additives), furnishing 2&#8208;zincated pyrimidines and 3&#8208;zincated pyridazine, which were then trapped with a variety of electrophiles. Contrasting with other s&#8208;block metalating systems, which lack selectivity in their reactions even when operating at low temperatures, these mixed Li/Zn bases enabled unprecedented regioselectivities that cannot be replicated by either LiTMP nor Zn(TMP)2 on their own. Spectroscopic and structural interrogations of organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions have shed light on the complex constitution of reaction mixtures and the origins of their special reactivities.

Spectroscopic and structural interrogations of organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions have shed light on the complex constitution of reaction mixtures and the origins of their special reactivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemical modification of tin perovskites by biocompatible multidentate chelators realized &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; healing of structural imperfections and manipulation of carrier dynamics, delivering an efficiency up to 13.70&#8201;% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep&#8208;level defects in the perovskite film and under&#8208;optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2&#8208;Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which passivated a variety of deep&#8208;level Sn&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, an efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with a small voltage deficit of &#8776;0.47&#8197;V has been achieved for the GAA&#8208;modified Sn&#8208;PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn&#8208;PSCs over 1200&#8197;hours.

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Photochemical 1,4&#8208;Bisalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene with Pd/Cu Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective three&#8208;component photochemical 1,4&#8208;bisalkylation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene was achieved through synergistic palladium/copper catalysis. This transformation provided rapid access to &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing quaternary stereocenters in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies confirmed the involvement of excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis.







Abstract
Catalysis by excited&#8208;state palladium has emerged as an active area of research, but controlling the enantioselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, we report the use of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis to accomplish the first three&#8208;component photochemical 1,4&#8208;bisalkylation reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. Consequently, &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing quaternary stereocenters were expeditiously synthesized from three simple starting materials: an alkyl bromide, butadiene, and an aldimine ester. Experimental and computational investigation of the reaction mechanism confirmed a radical pathway involving catalysis by an excited&#8208;state palladium species. The stereochemistry is mainly controlled by the chiral Cu catalyst.

         <title>Direct Dry Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts: A Study on Comminution and Alloying of Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic supported nanoparticles can be obtained by direct ball milling of the coarse powders of the metals and oxide support. The process was time&#8208;resolved via X&#8208;ray diffraction methods and electron microscopy so that a possible mechanism for the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles was developed. The study was extended to different systems, and it was found that final material features, like metal dispersion, can be predicted.







Abstract
Ball milling is growing increasingly important as an alternative synthetic tool to prepare catalytic materials. It was recently observed that supported metal catalysts could be directly obtained upon ball milling from the coarse powders of metal and oxide support. Moreover, when two compatible metal sources are simultaneously subjected to the mechanochemical treatment, bimetallic nanoparticles are obtained. A systematic investigation was extended to different metals and supports to understand better the mechanisms involved in the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles. Based on this, a model describing the role of metal&#8208;support interactions in the synthesis was developed. The findings will be helpful for the future rational design of supported metal catalysts via dry ball milling.

         <title>Highly Strained Bi&#8208;MOF on Bismuth Oxyhalide Support with Tailored Intermediate Adsorption/Desorption Capability for Robust CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;mounted Bi&#8208;MOF/BiOBr hybrid with high site&#8208;specific internal strain was engineered. The resulting alteration of p band center of the Bi nodes leads to a new (decreased) overlapping in the Bi 6p and CO2 (CO) 2p orbital hybridization. Therefore, favourable CO2 adsorption and accelerated dissociation of the *CO intermediate could be achieved, delivering high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoconversion efficiency.







Abstract
Herein, using as&#8208;designed surface&#8208;mounted Bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) on two&#8208;dimensional BiOBr support, as an operable platform for site&#8208;specific strain engineering to tailor the intermediate adsorption/desorption capability in CO2 photocatalytic conversion is proposed. Giant compressive strain up to 7.85&#8201;% is successfully induced on the surface&#8208;mounted Bi&#8208;MOF revealed by HRTEM images and geometric phase analysis as well as in situ Raman characterization, which largely downshifts the p band center of Bi nodes and intensifies their unsaturated state. In&#8208;depth explorations are put onto p&#8208;p (Bi 6p and CO2/CO 2p) orbital hybridization. Taking the adsorption process as an example, the 1&#960; and 7&#963; frontier molecule orbitals of CO2 2p for both the strain&#8208;free and strained models shift downwards the Fermi level, indicative of fast adsorption of CO2. Meanwhile, strain engineering further induces new non&#8208;degenerate orbital overlapping near 1&#960; and intensified overlapping of 7&#963; orbitals, stimulating the fast activation of absorbed CO2 molecules.

         <title>Direct Observation of Li&#8208;Ion Transport Heterogeneity Induced by Nanoscale Phase Separation in Li&#8208;rich Cathodes of Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
HAADF and in situ DPC&#8208;STEM were used to directly observe Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity caused by phase separation, which elucidates the reason for the capacity limitation of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode materials with high specific capacities could significantly enhance the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the specific practical capacities of LLO materials in ASSLBs are extremely low due to poor initial activation. Here, scanning transmission electron microscopy with in situ differential phase contrast imaging was first used to study the initial activation mechanism of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2. Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity was observed in LLO grains and across the LLO/Li6PS5Cl interface, due to the coexistence of the nanoscale Li2MnO3 and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 phases. Consequently, the severely constrained activation of Li2MnO3 during the first charging could be attributed to a nanoscale phase separation in LLO, hindering Li&#8208;ion transport through its particles, and causing high impedance in the Li2MnO3 domain/Li6PS5Cl interface.

     alt="Direct Observation of Li-Ion Transport Heterogeneity Induced by Nanoscale Phase Separation in Li-rich Cathodes of Solid-State Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAADF and in situ DPC-STEM were used to directly observe Li-ion transport heterogeneity caused by phase separation, which elucidates the reason for the capacity limitation of Li-rich layered oxides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode materials with high specific capacities could significantly enhance the energy density of all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the specific practical capacities of LLO materials in ASSLBs are extremely low due to poor initial activation. Here, scanning transmission electron microscopy with in situ differential phase contrast imaging was first used to study the initial activation mechanism of Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.54&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Li-ion transport heterogeneity was observed in LLO grains and across the LLO/Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl interface, due to the coexistence of the nanoscale Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phases. Consequently, the severely constrained activation of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; during the first charging could be attributed to a nanoscale phase separation in LLO, hindering Li-ion transport through its particles, and causing high impedance in the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; domain/Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl interface. This study could facilitate interface design of high-performance LLO-based ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Initiative Collision at Microelectrodes with Vertically Mobile Micromotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic metal&#8211;organic framework micromotors with controllable vertical motion are applied to electrochemical impact measurements, which offer a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and the particles and shed light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.







Abstract
Impact experiments enable single particle analysis for many applications. However, the effect of the trajectory of a particle to an electrode on impact signals still requires further exploration. Here, we investigate the particle impact measurements versus motion using micromotors with controllable vertical motion. With biocatalytic cascade reactions, the micromotor system utilizes buoyancy as the driving force, thus enabling more regulated interactions with the electrode. With the aid of numerical simulations, the dynamic interactions between the electrode and micromotors are categorized into four representative patterns: approaching, departing, approaching&#8208;and&#8208;departing, and departing&#8208;and&#8208;reapproaching, which correspond well with the experimentally observed impact signals. This study offers a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and particles, shedding light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Catalyst for the Fluorination of Acyl Chlorides at Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized via thermal decomposition of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). The Co1&#8722;N4@NC catalyst generated a stable Co&#8722;F intermediate in situ through an oxidative fluorination pathway to replace the substitution fluorination of the unstable high&#8208;valent Co system. In the presence of Co&#8722;F intermediates, KF can be used to replace AgF. Co1&#8722;N4@NC exhibited ultrahigh catalytic activity for the fluorination of acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Improving the stability of sensitive catalytic systems is an emerging research topic in the catalysis field. However, the current design of heterogeneous catalysts mainly improves their catalytic performance. This paper presents a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) strategy to improve the cobalt&#8208;catalysed fluorination of acyl chlorides. A stable Co&#8722;F intermediate can be formed through the oxidative fluorination of Co1&#8722;N4@NC SAC, which can replace the unstable high&#8208;valent cobalt catalytic system and avoid the use of phosphine ligands. In the SAC system, KF can be employed as a fluorinating reagent to replace the AgF, which can be applied to various substrates and scale&#8208;up conversion with high turnover numbers (TON=1.58&#215;106). This work also shows that inorganic SACs have tremendous potential for organofluorine chemistry, and it provides a good reference for follow&#8208;up studies on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between catalyst design and chemical reaction mechanisms.

         <title>A CO2&#8208;Masked Carbene Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) decorated covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2) heterogeneous catalyst is prepared. COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 catalyzes the hydrosilylation of CO2 and the N&#8208;formylation of amines with CO2 to produce methanol and formamides. The activities rank COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 among the most active heterogeneous catalysts for these CO2 fixation reactions.







Abstract
Free N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are generally prepared by treatment of imidazolium precursors with strong alkali reagents, which usually produces inactive NHC dimers. This treatment would destroy porous supports and thus make supported NHC catalysts difficult to recovery and reuse. Herein, we report the first stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) grafted on a porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF). The stable NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties in the COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 could be transformed in situ into isolated NHCs by heating, which exhibit superior catalytic performances in hydrosilylation and N&#8208;formylation reactions with CO2. The NHC sites can reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 and thus can be easily recycled and reused while maintaining excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations revealed that NHC sites can be fully exposed after removal of CO2&#8208;masks and rapidly react with silanes, which endows COF&#8208;NHC with high catalytic activity.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence of Perovskites with Reduced Dimensionality Achieved by Manipulating Adsorption&#8208;Energy Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have exemplified the critical role of adsorption&#8208;energy differences in the structural regulation of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites by complementing theoretical calculations and experiments. As a result, we achieved deep&#8208;blue PeLED peaking at 457&#8197;nm with a record EQE of 4.62&#8201;% accompanied by stable electroluminescent spectra. Our findings provide a way for PeLEDs to develop their full technological potential.







Abstract
The lagging development of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) heavily impedes their practical applications in full&#8208;color display due to the absence of spectrally stable emitters and the mismatch of carrier injection capacity. Herein, we report highly efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs through a new chemical strategy that addresses the dilemma for simultaneously constant electroluminescence (EL) spectra and high&#8208;purify phase in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites. The success lies in the control of adsorption&#8208;energy differences between phenylbutylamine (PBA) and ethylamine (EA) interacting with perovskites, which facilitates narrow n&#8208;value distribution. This approach leads to an increased exciton binding energy and enhanced surface potential, hence improving radiative recombination. As a result, an external quantum efficiency of 4.62&#8201;% is achieved in PeLEDs with a stable EL peak at 457&#8197;nm, demonstrating the best reported result for deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs so far.

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Mediated &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acidic Diketones with ortho&#8208;Substituted Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular, bismacycle&#8208;mediated method is disclosed for the oxidative coupling of cyclic and fluoroalkyl diketones with ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. A wide range of functionality is tolerated on both partners, providing direct access to agrochemically and pharmaceutically important motifs that are currently inaccessible by other approaches.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic and fluoroalkyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is made challenging by the highly stabilized nature of the corresponding enolates, and is especially difficult for sterically demanding aryl partners. As a general solution to this problem, we report the Bi&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling of acidic diones and ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. Starting from a bench&#8208;stable bismacycle precursor, a sequence of B&#8208;to&#8208;Bi transmetallation, oxidation and C&#8722;C bond formation furnishes the arylated diones. Development of methodology that tolerates both sensitive functionality and steric demand is supported by interrogation of key reactive intermediates. Application of our strategy to cyclic diones enables the concise synthesis of important agrochemical intermediates which were previously prepared using toxic Pb reagents. This methodology also enables the first ever arylation of fluoroalkyl diones which, upon condensation with hydrazine, provides direct access to valuable fluoroalkyl pyrazoles.

         <title>Reconstruction of Highly Dense Cu&#8722;N4 Active Sites in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Characterized by Operando Synchrotron Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando synchrotron radiation identifies the reconstruction process of highly dense Cu&#8722;N4 sites transforming to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and then to Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under potential&#8208;driver, which could regulate the d&#8208;band center of metal atom and balance the competition of rate&#8208;determining step for ORR, thus optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance.







Abstract
The emerging star of single atomic site (SAS) catalyst has been regarded as the most promising Pt&#8208;substituted electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the metal loading in SAS directly affects the whole device performance. Herein, we report a dual nitrogen source coordinated strategy to realize high dense Cu&#8722;N4 SAS with a metal loading of 5.61&#8197;wt% supported on 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes/graphene structure wherein simultaneously performs superior ORR activity and stability in alkaline media. When applied in H2/O2 AEMFC, it could reach an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.90&#8197;V and a peak power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Operando synchrotron radiation analyses identify the reconstruction from initial Cu&#8722;N4 to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and the subsequent Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under working conditions, which gradually regulate the d&#8208;band center of central metal and balance the Gibbs free energy of *OOH and *O intermediates, benefiting to ORR activity.

         <title>Autonomous Chiral Microswimmers with Self&#8208;mixing Capabilities for Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;propelled microreactors producing chiral molecules with a high enantiomeric excess are proposed as a complementary approach with respect to classic stereoselective electroorganic synthesis. The straightforward concept is based on a spontaneous redox reaction occurring at the surface of zinc (micro)wires covered with chiral oligomers.







Abstract
The development of chiral catalysts plays a very important role in various areas of chemical science. Heterogeneous catalysts have the general advantage of allowing a more straightforward separation from the products. One specific case of heterogeneous catalysis is electrocatalysis, being potentially a green chemistry approach. However, a typical drawback is that the redox conversion of molecules occurs only at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and not in the bulk of the electrolyte. The second limitation is that the electrodes have to be physically connected to a power supply to induce the desired reactions. To circumvent these problems, we propose here a complementary approach by replacing macroscopic electrodes with an ensemble of self&#8208;propelled redox active microswimmers. They move autonomously in solution while transforming simultaneously a prochiral starting compound into a specific enantiomer with a very high enantiomeric excess, accompanied by a significantly increased production rate of the favorite enantiomer.

         <title>Identification of a Novel Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Type IV IDO1 Inhibitor Chemotype</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;natural products are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by existing NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of the novel pseudo&#8208;NP class termed apoxidoles. Biological investigation revealed potent reduction of cellular kynurenine levels by apoxidoles through selective targeting of apo&#8208;indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (apo&#8208;IDO1).







Abstract
Natural product (NP)&#8208;inspired design principles provide invaluable guidance for bioactive compound discovery. Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) are de novo combinations of NP fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of apoxidoles, a novel pseudo&#8208;NP class, whereby indole&#8208; and tetrahydropyridine fragments are linked in monopodal connectivity not found in nature. Apoxidoles are efficiently accessible by an enantioselective [4+2] annulation reaction. Biological evaluation revealed that apoxidoles define a new potent type IV inhibitor chemotype of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a heme&#8208;containing enzyme considered a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration, autoimmunity and cancer. Apoxidoles target apo&#8208;IDO1, prevent heme binding and induce unique amino acid positioning as revealed by crystal structure analysis. Novel type IV apo&#8208;IDO1 inhibitors are in high demand, and apoxidoles may provide new opportunities for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage&#8208;Based Prodrug Activation Strategy Applied to &#946;&#8208;Lapachone for Cancer&#8208;Specific Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;C bond cleavage&#8208;based prodrug activation strategy is described and applied to &#946;&#8208;lapachone for cancer&#8208;specific targeting. The prodrug is activated through the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond and releases &#946;&#8208;lapachone for treating NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)&#8208;overexpressing cancers. This strategy provides a valuable addition to the existing prodrug strategies.







Abstract
Prodrugs are one of the most common strategies for the design of targeted anticancer agents. However, their application is often hampered by the modifiable groups available on parent drugs. Herein, a carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond cleavage&#8208;based prodrug activation strategy is reported, which was successfully used to design prodrugs of &#946;&#8208;lapachone (&#946;&#8208;lap), an ortho&#8208;quinone natural product without traditional modifiable groups for the construction of C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O bond cleavage&#8208;based prodrugs. The designed &#946;&#8208;lap prodrug with a reactive oxygen species&#8208;specific trigger was quickly activated, releasing &#946;&#8208;lap. It exerted anticancer efficacy via NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)&#8208;mediated futile redox cycling, resulting in potent cytotoxicity that was highly selective for NQO1&#8208;rich cancer cells over normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. This significantly amplified the therapeutic window of &#946;&#8208;lap. This study provides a practical strategy for the design of prodrugs for parent drugs that do not contain traditional modifiable groups.

Herein, a carbon-carbon (C&#8722;C) bond cleavage-based prodrug activation strategy is reported, which was successfully used to design prodrugs of &#946;-lapachone (&#946;-lap), an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone natural product without traditional modifiable groups for the construction of C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O bond cleavage-based prodrugs. The designed &#946;-lap prodrug with a reactive oxygen species-specific trigger was quickly activated, releasing &#946;-lap. It exerted anticancer efficacy via NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-mediated futile redox cycling, resulting in potent cytotoxicity that was highly selective for NQO1-rich cancer cells over normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. This significantly amplified the therapeutic window of &#946;-lap. This study provides a practical strategy for the design of prodrugs for parent drugs that do not contain traditional modifiable groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Plus Reversible Supramolecular Adhesives Achieved by Regulating Intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new class of reversible supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive systems by integrating adhesive chains with cyclometalated platinum(II) units in the same covalent skeleton. By manipulating intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, the organoplatinum(II) adhesives exhibit stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa.







Abstract
Surface adhesion has a great contradiction in high strength and good reversibility given their mutually exclusive requirements of fixed crosslinked networks and dynamic chain motion. Herein, we demonstrate a supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive system regulated by intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions that can simultaneously achieve high&#8208;strength and excellent reversible adhesion to various substrates. Upon alternating temperature, the assembly of suitably substituted organoplatinum(II) molecules can switch between well&#8208;ordered and disordered states via tuning PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, resulting in stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa and a large on&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;25. Along with the switch of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII contacts, the surface adhesion of organoplatinum(II) adhesives can be monitored by their changes in electrical signals. This study will open up new inspirations for developing high&#8208;performance reversible adhesives.

         <title>Arene Activation through Iminium Ions: Product Diversity from Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde&#8208;derived iminium ions 1 form benzoxacyclic products 2 in a photochemical reaction cascade (n=0,1). Structurally different products 3 (meta photocycloaddition) and 4 (aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction) are observed depending on two key substituents (R, R1).







Abstract
While 2&#8208;alk&#8208;&#969;&#8208;enyloxy&#8208;sustituted benzaldehydes do not display any photochemical reactivity at the arene core, the respective iminium perchlorates were found to undergo efficient reactions either upon direct irradiation (&#955;=366&#8197;nm) or under sensitizing conditions (&#955;=420&#8197;nm, 2.5&#8197;mol% thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one). Three pathways were found: (a)&#8197;Most commonly, the reaction led to benzoxacyclic products in which the olefin in the tether underwent a formal, yet unprecedented carboformylation (13 examples, 44&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). The cascade process occurred with high diastereoselectivity and was found to be stereoconvergent. (b)&#8197;If a substituent resides in the 3&#8208;position of the benzene ring, a meta photocycloaddition was observed which produced tetracyclic skeletons with five stereogenic centers in excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (2 examples, 58&#8211;79&#8201;% yield). (c)&#8197;If the tether was internally substituted at the alkene, an arene photocycloaddition was avoided and an azetidine was formed in an aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction (2 examples, 95&#8211;98&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale View of Protein&#8208;PEG Interactions that Redirect the Thermal Unfolding Pathway of PEGylated Human Galectin&#8208;3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylation of the carbohydrate recognition domain of human Galectin&#8208;3 dramatically redirected the protein thermal unfolding pathway. NMR spectroscopy showed PEG localized to the protein surface consistent with a &#8220;shroud&#8221; molecular model. Subtle changes in the PEG localization and corresponding thermal unfolding profiles were realized by replacing lysines near the protein&#8208;PEG interface.







Abstract
PEGylation is a promising approach to address the central challenge of applying biologics, i.e., lack of protein stability in the demanding environment of the human body. Wider application is hindered by lack of atomic level understanding of protein&#8208;PEG interactions, preventing design of conjugates with predicted properties. We deployed an integrative structural and biophysical approach to address this critical challenge with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3C), a lectin essential for cell adhesion and potential biologic. PEGylation dramatically increased Gal3C thermal stability, forming a stable intermediate and redirecting its unfolding pathway. Structural details revealed by NMR pointed to a potential role of PEG localization facilitated by charged residues. Replacing these residues subtly altered the protein&#8208;PEG interface and thermal unfolding behavior, providing insight into rationally designing conjugates while preserving PEGylation benefits.

         <title>Phase Separation of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 upon Specific RNA&#8208;Binding Observed by Magnetic Resonance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble model of free dispersed full&#8208;length heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was generated from magnetic resonance data based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling and from a small&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering curve. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with this model provides insight into the interplay of specific single&#8208;stranded RNA recognition by hnRNP A1 and its liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.







Abstract
Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with specific single&#8208;stranded RNA and its relation to liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) were studied in vitro by magnetic resonance based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling. An ensemble model of dispersed hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low&#8208;complexity domain and its interaction with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. Addition of RNA to dispersed hnRNP A1 induced liquid&#8208;droplet formation. Such LLPS depended on RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing an influence of RNA point mutations on local protein dynamics. We propose that an interplay of sequence&#8208;specific RNA binding and LLPS contributes to regulation of specific RNA segregation during stress response.

         <title>The Origin of High&#8208;Voltage Stability in Single&#8208;Crystal Layered Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>

The drastic H2/H3 phase transition and destructive H3b phase formation presented in PC electrode are effectively suppressed in SC cathodes when cycling at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, in which the origin of excellent high&#8208;voltage stability in single&#8208;crystal was clearly clarified.







Abstract
Compared with the polycrystal (PC) Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, the single&#8208;crystal (SC) counterpart displayed excellent structural stability, high reversible capacity and limited voltage decay during cycling, which received great attention from academics and industry. However, the origin of fascinating high&#8208;voltage stability within SC is poorly understood yet. Herein, we tracked the evolution of phase transitions, in which the destructive volume change and H3 phase formation presented in PC, are effectively suppressed in SC when cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, further clarifying the origin of high&#8208;voltage stability in SC cathode. Moreover, SC electrode displayed crack&#8208;free morphology, and excellent electrochemical stability during long&#8208;term cycling, whereas PC suffered severe capacity and voltage fade because of the spinel&#8208;like phase, decoding the failure mechanisms of PC and SC during cycling at high cut&#8208;off voltages. This finding provides universal insights into high&#8208;voltage stability and failure mechanisms of layered Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Phen&#8208;DC3 Induces Refolding of Human Telomeric DNA into a Chair&#8208;Type Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex through Ligand Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phen&#8208;DC3 is one of the most widely used specific G&#8208;quadruplex ligands. This work reveals that Phen&#8208;DC3 intercalates in an antiparallel chair&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex adopted by human telomeric sequence, with the ligand positioned between two G&#8208;quartets on the one side, and a dynamic yet fully formed G&#8208;quartet capped by a T&#8208;A&#8208;A triad on the other side.







Abstract
Human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures are attractive anticancer drug targets, but the target's polymorphism complicates the drug design: different ligands prefer different folds, and very few complexes have been solved at high resolution. Here we report that Phen&#8208;DC3, one of the most prominent G&#8208;quadruplex ligands in terms of high binding affinity and selectivity, causes dTAGGG(TTAGGG)3 to completely change its fold in KCl solution from a hybrid&#8208;1 to an antiparallel chair&#8208;type structure, wherein the ligand intercalates between a two&#8208;quartet unit and a pseudo&#8208;quartet, thereby ejecting one potassium ion. This unprecedented high&#8208;resolution NMR structure shows for the first time a true ligand intercalation into an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex.

         <title>Divergent CO2 Activation by Tuning the Lewis Acid in Iron&#8208;Based Bimetallic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting CO2 activation reactivity using bimetallic Fe0/Lewis acid combinations is reported. The use of gold promotes irreversible CO2/N2 exchange, whereas push&#8208;pull CO2 fixation structures emerge from the use of acidic zinc and borane compounds. The use of an alane, Al(C6F5)3, promotes bimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Computational studies support the observed divergent reactivity and substantiate the bonding scenario.







Abstract
Bimetallic motifs mediate the selective activation and functionalization of CO2 in metalloenzymes and some recent synthetic systems. In this work, we build on the nascent concept of bimetallic frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to investigate the activation and reduction of CO2. Using the Fe0 fragment [(depe)2Fe] (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) as base, we modify the nature of the partner Lewis acid to accomplish a divergent and highly chemoselective reactivity towards CO2. [Au(PMe2Ar)]+ irreversibly dissociates CO2, Zn(C6F5)2 and B(C6F5)3 yield different CO2 adducts stabilized by push&#8208;pull interactions, while Al(C6F5)3 leads to a rare heterobimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and thus to contrasting reduced products after exposure to dihydrogen. Computational investigations provide a rationale for the divergent reactivity, while Energy Decomposition Analysis&#8208;Natural Orbital for Chemical Valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) method substantiates the heterobimetallic bonding situation.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of Methyl Esters and CO in Lignin Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete utilization of lignin: the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates (applied to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals), and the remaining carbon atoms of lignin react with oxygen to form CO predominantly, which may be used directly in carbonylation reactions.







Abstract
Lignin is an abundant renewable carbon source. Due to its complex structure, utilization of lignin is very challenging. Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the simultaneous utilization of lignin, in which the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates and the other alkyl and phenyl carbons react with oxygen to predominantly form CO that can be used directly in carbonylation reactions. The method was applied to the methylation of various functionalized aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids, including natural compounds, to produce valuable chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. No solid or liquid residues remain after the reaction. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that a well&#8208;ordered C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond activation sequence takes place to realize total transformation of lignin. This work opens a way for transformation of the entire lignin polymer into valuable products, exemplified by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical, Ramipril, on a gram scale.

         <title>Cobaloxime Photocatalysis for the Synthesis of Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime was employed as the sole photocatalyst in the cyclization phosphorylation of isocyanides and Csp2&#8722;H phosphorylation. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, a series of phosphorus&#8208;substituted phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, isoquinolines, and common heteroaromatics were obtained in good to excellent yields without any aid of electrolysis, metal reductants, or oxidants, and with only H2 or CH4 as byproduct.







Abstract
Herein, cobaloxime is used for the first time as a catalyst for the synthesis of phosphorylated heteroaromatics, which is an intriguing and versatile functional motif. With visible&#8208;light irradiation, cobaloxime not only oxidizes phosphine oxides to form phosphorus radicals (P&#8208;radicals) for a subsequent reaction with radical acceptor isocyanides or heteroaromatics, but also combines the radical intermediate with &#946;&#8208;H elimination, thereby producing phosphorylated heteroaromatics with only H2 or CH4 as byproduct. Phosphine oxides with dialkyl, alkylaryl, and diaryl substituents could be directly transformed into phosphorylated phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, isoquinolines, and common heteroaromatics. This catalytic system features extremely mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields. Scale&#8208;up reaction and sunlight reaction show the great application potential in the green synthesis of important organophosphorus chemicals.

A photothermally selective AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP laminated nanofiber film with Janus structure is prepared by fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly method. The two sides of AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP reveal different photothermal performances. Such lightweight, breathable and conductive nanofiber&#8208;hybrid textile enables applications in thermoregulatory garments that possess the performances of heat preservation in winter and cooling in summer.







Abstract
Given health threat by global warming and increased energy consumption in regulating body temperature, it is an urgent need to construct smart temperature&#8208;regulating materials. Herein, a novel fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly (FACA) method is proposed to construct nanofiber materials with asymmetric photothermal properties. The silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) with opposite thermal radiation are assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film, imparting AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP film with Janus structure that can realize the AgNWs side consistently keeps temperature of ca. 11&#8201;&#176;C lower than the side of PVDF&#8208;HFP nanofiber regardless of the irradiation directions under 1 sun, suggesting the adjustable photothermal regulation. Such photothermally selective hybrid nanofiber film provides great potential as fabrics to achieve all&#8208;weather smart clothes, promoting controllable and comprehensive utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Additives Modulate Calcification by Interacting with Prenucleation Clusters on the Molecular Level
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but effective: only few small additives are potent antiscalants, extremely solubilizing CaCO3. These underlying molecular mechanisms act beyond standard concepts of nucleation inhibition: they trigger, stabilize, and feed PNCs, presetting key properties of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). This study reveals how small molecules may co&#8208;regulate biomineralization and breaks grounds for sustainable antiscalants.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW) additives can strongly impact amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), playing an elusive role in biogenic, geologic, and industrial calcification. Here, we present molecular mechanisms by which these additives regulate stability and composition of both CaCO3 solutions and solid ACC. Potent antiscalants inhibit ACC precipitation by interacting with prenucleation clusters (PNCs); they specifically trigger and integrate into PNCs or feed PNC growth actively. Only PNC&#8208;interacting additives are traceable in ACC, considerably stabilizing it against crystallization. The selective incorporation of potent additives in PNCs is a reliable chemical label that provides conclusive chemical evidence that ACC is a molecular PNC&#8208;derived precipitate. Our results reveal additive&#8208;cluster interactions beyond established mechanistic conceptions. They reassess the role of small&#8208;MW molecules in crystallization and biomineralization while breaking grounds for new sustainable antiscalants.

The first example of a double&#8208;helical metal&#8208;chain metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8) is prepared. It shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The highly conjugated ZUT&#8208;8 structure was introduced into a cathodic metal&#8208;protection system where it significantly decreases metal corrosion.







Abstract
The development of novel metal organic framework (MOF) friction power generation materials with high stability is important. This paper reports the first example of a double&#8208;helix metal chain organic framework with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8). ZUT&#8208;8 shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability, and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The cathodic protection system with ZUT&#8208;8 can prevent metal corrosion significantly. The output performance can be improved effectively by enhancing the conjugate effect of the linker. The theoretical calculation results showed that an increase in the degree of conjugation could significantly reduce the band gap, thereby affecting the friction power output signal. This study opens the door to constructing MOF materials with a double&#8208;helix metal chain and will promote their potential applications in self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.

         <title>Enantioselective para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization of Alkyl Benzene Derivatives via Cooperative Catalysis of Gold/Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of non&#8208;activated arenes via cooperative catalysis is disclosed. The strategy merges gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) in the synthesis of a variety of chiral diaryl esters with high site&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkyl benzene derivatives was successfully developed via cooperative catalysis of gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), leading to synthetically useful chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs. Chiral phosphoric acid, ligand, and molecular sieves were found to be crucial for enantioselectivity control of this transformation. The salient features of this protocol include mild conditions, high efficiency, commercially available starting materials, highly chemo&#8208; and site&#8208; as well as enantioselective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization, broad substrate scope, and extensive applications of the chiral products. The mechanistic studies suggested that two CPAs might be involved in chiral induction.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover and Its Relation to Hydrogenation: Observations on Structurally Defined Single&#8208;Atom Sites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to common belief, hydrogen spillover can be either beneficial or detrimental to the catalytic performance of hydrogenation catalysts. This was determined through in&#8208;depth studies of structurally well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom catalysts as well as conventional Pt/WO3.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the transfer of H atoms from metal sites onto the catalyst support, is ubiquitous in chemical processes such as catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogen storage. Atomic level information concerning the kinetics of this process, the structural evolution of catalysts during hydrogen spillover, as well as the nature of participation of the spilled over H in catalysis, remain vastly lacking. Here, we provide insights to those questions with a solubilized polyoxometalate&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalyst which allows for the use of characterization techniques generally inaccessible to the study of heterogeneous catalysts. Hydrogenation kinetics together with poisoning studies further reveal that hydrogen spillover can be either detrimental or beneficial for catalysis, the direction and magnitude of which depends mostly on the nature of the reducible functional group. Similar trends were observed on one of the most prototypical hydrogen spillover catalysts&#8212;Pt/WO3.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence Duality in Tetracationic Binaphthyl&#8208;Based Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetracationic enantiopure cyclophanes have been synthesized by the insertion of axially chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl fluorophores into the constitutions of pyridinium&#8208;based macrocycles. These highly charged fluorescent cyclophanes exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emissions and display CPL responses both in solution and in the aggregated state.







Abstract
Here, we report an approach to the synthesis of highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes by the insertion of axially chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl fluorophores into the constitutions of pyridinium&#8208;based macrocycles. Remarkably, these fluorescent tetracationic cyclophanes exhibit a significant AIE compared to their neutral optically active binaphthyl precursors. A combination of theoretical calculations and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the AIE originates from limited torsional vibrations associated with the axes of chirality present in the chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl units and the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic landscape when incorporated within the cyclophane structure. Furthermore, these highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes display CPL responses both in solution and in the aggregated state. This unique duality of AIE and CPL in these tetracationic cyclophanes is destined to be of major importance in future development of photonic devices and bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>What Matters for a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article provides tips on how to increase the chances of securing a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant.







Abstract
European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grants are arguably the most competitive grants in Europe and their prestige is fully justified considering that they (i) allow focus on a high risk/high gain project through generous funding of 1.5&#8211;2&#8197;million Euros, (ii) they can enable the foundation of a new academic group and earn the submitting principal investigator a professorship, and (iii) they serve as a highly reputable award that can either facilitate tenure/promotion or assist in securing a subsequent academic position. However, the journey to getting one is far from easy. In this Viewpoint Article, I will discuss my first two unsuccessful attempts to secure an ERC Starting Grant and how the lessons learned during the process led me to ultimately secure a grant upon my third attempt.

Enter stereogradient PLA: A tripodal zirconium complex catalyzes the polymerization of L&#8208;lactide contaminated with meso&#8208;lactide to yield stereogradient poly(lactic acid) (PLA), as described by Moshe Kol and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202207652). The stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers derived from tin octanoate, and may alleviate the need for L&#8208;lactide purification.

Grafting N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on porous materials to realize high activity and recyclability is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202207478), Yuan&#8208;Biao Huang, Rong Cao, and co&#8208;workers describe the development of a facile method for utilizing NHC sites generated in&#8197;situ from CO2&#8208;masked precursors anchored on a covalent organic framework (COF) for sustainable catalytic CO2 conversion. The NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties can be transformed into NHC sites by heating in a catalytic process, in which the CO2 molecules mask the NHC sites and reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 after catalysis.

         <dc:description>
Strategies for the construction of bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels as well as recent advances form the focus of this Minireview. The feasibility of these bio&#8208;inspired channels for exploring physiological events, the detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion is presented along with prospects for the future development of this vibrant field.







Abstract
Highly efficient biological ion channels with sophisticated transport characteristics in living organisms have inspired the design of artificial channels that are functionally comparable to those of their natural counterparts and applicable on a much larger scale. Self&#8208;assembly currently offers a facile approach for producing nanoconfined ion channels that exhibit smart ion&#8208;transport properties, including ion selectivity, gating, and rectification, and have shown great potential for various applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of strategies for engineering bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels. We focus on emerging channel assemblies based on different fabrication processes such as supramolecular assembly, nanosystem&#8208;based fabrication, and polymer&#8208;based integration. The applications of these bio&#8208;inspired channels in the exploration of physiological events, detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion are concisely presented. Finally, future developments and challenges of this booming research field are proposed.

         <dc:description>
The possibility of generating unidirectional, controlled rotary motion by chemical conversion is a major challenge. This Review provides an overview of approaches to the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of various classes of atropisomers that can perform controlled switching or directional rotational motion under the influence of a chemical stimulus. Future strategies and challenges for the development of autonomous molecular motors are also provided.







Abstract
Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are major steps towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light&#8208;induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task. In this Review, an overview of approaches towards the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of different classes of atropisomers which can undergo controlled switching or rotation under the influence of a chemical stimulus is presented. They are categorized as molecular switches, rotors, motors, and autonomous motors according to their type of response. Furthermore, we provide a future perspective and challenges focusing on building sophisticated molecular machines.

Let's make metal&#8208;based drugs more selective! Metal&#8208;based compounds have been widely used for biomedical applications. Their unique characteristics make them attractive for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. However, numerous issues including toxicity, poor aqueous solubility, and unfavorable biodistribution hamper their widespread use. To overcome these drawbacks, the concept of metal&#8208;based prodrugs emerged. The main advances in the use of metal&#8208;based prodrugs are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based compounds have been widely used for biomedical applications. Their unique characteristics make them attractive for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. However, numerous issues including toxicity, poor aqueous solubility, and unfavorable biodistribution hamper their widespread use. To overcome these drawbacks, the concept of metal&#8208;based prodrugs emerged. This field is particularly developed for applications in oncology. More precisely, tumor&#8208;associated stimuli (e.g., pH variation, redox activity, enzyme overexpression, etc.) have been exploited to trigger the selective delivery of active metal&#8208;based drugs to the tumor site. The main advances in this area are discussed in this Review.

         <title>Design and Growth of Branched Organic Crystals: Recent Advances and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional hierarchical organic crystals with branched architectures are suitable fundamental building blocks in integrated photonic devices because of their inherent multichannel characteristics for the efficient generation and processing of optical signals. This Review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis and photonic applications of organic branched crystals as well as the challenges and prospects for their future development.







Abstract
The rapid development of information technology has resulted in a growing demand for low&#8208;dimensional photonic materials. Organic semiconductor materials play an important role in various photonic devices due to their adjustable physicochemical properties, while individual organic crystals do not exhibit the desired performance due to the limitations of their simple structure. Branched organic crystals with inherent multichannel characteristics based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are favorable components in optoelectronics. However, the preparation of branched organic crystals still faces great challenges before they can be applied in integrated optoelectronic devices. In this Review, the development and representative examples of branched organic crystals in terms of molecular design, synthesis, and advanced applications are discussed. We also provide a summary and outlook for the direction of future research on branched organic crystals as excellent candidates in photonic integrated circuits.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Formation of B&#8722;N Bonds for BN&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Multiple Resonance Emitters with Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access multiple resonance (MR) emitter is constructed by simplifying multiborylation through amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds, while introducing an additional para&#8208;positioned N atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, m[B&#8208;N]N1 and m[B&#8208;N]N2, exhibit impressive maximum EQE values of 36.0&#8201;% and 33.4&#8201;%, with narrowband emissions at 480 and 486&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of only 26 and 32&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable multiple resonance (MR) optoelectronic properties of organic nanographenes with boron and nitrogen atoms disposed para to each other, the synthetic procedures are sophisticated with low yields and the molecular skeletons are limited. Here, a new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access MR emitter is constructed by simplifying the multiborylation through amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds while introducing an additional para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules exhibit narrowband emissions at 480 and 490&#8197;nm, with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of only 29 and 34&#8197;nm. The devices based on them showed external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of &gt;33.0&#8201;%, which remained above 24.0&#8201;% even at a high brightness of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the first example of MR emitters with a B&#8722;N covalent bond, not only decreasing the synthesis difficulty but also increasing the diversity of MR skeletons for emerging new optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Over Atomically Dispersed Synergistic Ni/Co Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ni/Co dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (a&#8208;NiCo/NC) hollow prisms are synthesized through a templated assisted atom migration&#8208;trapping route. Due to the delicately designed dual&#8208;metal sites and their synergistic interactions, the a&#8208;NiCo/NC electrocatalyst exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance compared with atomically dispersed single&#8208;metal&#8208;site counterparts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are being pursued as economical electrocatalysts. However, their low active&#8208;site loading, poor interactions, and unclear catalytic mechanism call for significant advances. Herein, atomically dispersed Ni/Co dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (a&#8208;NiCo/NC) hollow prisms are rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites and their synergistic interactions, the obtained a&#8208;NiCo/NC sample exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and kinetics towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that the strong synergistic interactions from heteronuclear paired Ni/Co dual sites lead to the optimization of the electronic structure and the reduced reaction energy barrier. This work provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;efficiency atomically dispersed dual&#8208;site SACs in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Symmetric Azoarenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Silicon&#8208;Masked Diazenyl Anions and (Hetero)Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric azobenzene derivatives by an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling is presented. N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;silyldiazenes are employed as diazenyl anion equivalents that can be selectively coupled under palladium catalysis with a large array of (hetero)aryl bromides in high yields. The functional&#8208;group tolerance on either (hetero)aryl ring is excellent.







Abstract
The photoswitchable motif of azobenzenes is of great importance across the life and materials sciences. This maintains a constant demand for their efficient synthesis, especially that of non&#8208;symmetric derivatives. We disclose here a general strategy for their synthesis through an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling where functionalized aryl&#8208;substituted diazenes masked with a silyl group are employed as diazenyl pronucleophiles. These equivalents of fragile diazenyl anions couple with a diverse set of (hetero)aryl bromides under palladium catalysis with no loss of dinitrogen. The competing denitrogenative biaryl formation is fully suppressed. The reaction requires only a minimal excess, that is 1.2 equivalents, of the diazenyl component. By this, a broad range of azoarenes decorated with two electron&#8208;rich/deficient aryl groups can be accessed in a predictable way with superb functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation with a Carbon&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst and Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water&#8208;donating transfer hydrogenation can be achieved over a palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon nitride, in which hydrogen protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are sequentially added to various unsaturated bonds. In&#8208;depth characterization confirms the direct hydrogenation mechanism and links the outstanding performance to reduced barriers for hydrogenation and accelerated proton supply from water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds has received considerable attention in the research area of sustainable organic synthesis; however, water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen, has rarely been investigated due to the high barrier associated with splitting of water molecules. We report a carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalyst with unparalleled performance in photocatalytic water&#8208;donating transfer hydrogenation compared to its nanoparticle counterparts. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments and operando nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirm the direct hydrogenation mechanism using in situ&#8208;generated protons from water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Density functional theory calculations attribute the high activity to lower barriers for hydrogenation, facilitated desorption of ethylbenzene, and facile hydrogen replenishment from water on the atomic palladium sites.

         <title>Novel Poxin Stable cGAMP&#8208;Derivatives Are Remarkable STING Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dideoxy&#8208;cyclic&#8208;dinucleotide analogs of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP are prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. The dideoxy analogs are found to exhibit remarkable in cellulo and in vitro properties, are stable against degradation by poxvirus immune nucleases, and exhibit superior tumor growth control in a mouse model.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP is a cyclic A&#8208; and G&#8208;containing dinucleotide second messenger, which is formed upon cellular recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA as part of the innate immune response. The molecule binds to the adaptor protein STING, which induces an immune response characterized by the production of type I interferons and cytokines. The development of STING&#8208;binding molecules with both agonistic as well as antagonistic properties is currently of tremendous interest to induce or enhance antitumor or antiviral immunity on the one hand, or to treat autoimmune diseases on the other hand. To escape the host innate immune recognition, some viruses encode poxin endonucleases that cleave 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP. Here we report that dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP (1) and analogs thereof, which lack the secondary ribose&#8208;OH groups, form a group of poxin&#8208;stable STING agonists. Despite their reduced affinity to STING, particularly the compound constructed from two A nucleosides, dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cAAMP (2), features an unusually high antitumor response in mice.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Isolation of An Aza&#8208;Triangulene and Its Cation in Crystalline Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene and its cation were synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. The cation is an isoelectronic structure of triangulene, showing a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of about 0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives is challenging due to their intrinsic high spin nature. Herein, we report solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (i.e., aza&#8208;triangulene) (NT) and its cation (NT+) in single&#8208;crystal form. Notably, the cation NT+ can be regarded as an isoelectronic structure of the corresponding all&#8208;carbon triangulene. Both NT and NT+ show reasonable stability due to kinetic blocking by bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl substituents, and intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Bond length analysis, magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the neutral NT has a doublet ground state with a zwitterionic character, while the cation NT+ exhibits a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of +0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This study provides a rational strategy to access high&#8208;spin systems by heteroatom doping of pure &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Stereoselective Three&#8208;Step One&#8208;Pot Cascade Combining Amino&#8208; and Biocatalysis to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Nitro Alcohols

         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic cascades offer a simple and efficient way to rapidly build structural complexity. A three&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process is reported in which a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;mediated asymmetric conjugate addition, and a bioreduction step were combined to access chiral nitro alcohols from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives in good overall yields and excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The combination of small&#8208;molecule catalysis and enzyme catalysis represents an underexploited area of research with huge potential in asymmetric synthetic chemistry due to both compatibility of reaction conditions and complementary reactivity. Herein, we describe the telescopic synthesis of chiral nitro alcohols starting from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives through the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step chemoenzymatic cascade combination of a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysed asymmetric conjugate addition, and ketoreductase&#8208;mediated reduction to access the corresponding target compounds in moderate to excellent overall isolated yields (36&#8211;80&#8201;%) and high diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios (up to &gt;97&#8201;:&#8201;3). This represents the first example of the combination of an organocatalysed asymmetric conjugate addition via iminium ion activation and a bioreduction step catalysed by ketoreductases.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol over a Carbon&#8208;Coated CuOx Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;coated CuOx catalyst achieves a remarkable ethanol partial current density of 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 46&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, substantially higher than those over most reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. The surface carbon coating can effectively stabilize the abundant Cu+ species, thus facilitate C&#8722;C coupling by improving *CO adsorption, and tune the key intermediate *HOCCH in the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.







Abstract
The design of efficient copper(Cu)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for CO2 electroreduction into multiple carbon products. However, most Cu&#8208;based catalysts are favorable for ethylene production while selective production of ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency and current density still remains a great challenge. Herein, we design a carbon&#8208;coated CuOx (CuOx@C) catalyst through one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), which exhibits high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with Faradaic efficiency of 46&#8201;%. Impressively, the partial current density of ethanol reaches 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is higher than that of most reported catalysts. Operando Raman spectra indicate that the carbon coating can efficiently stabilize Cu+ species under CO2 electroreduction conditions, which promotes the C&#8722;C coupling step.

&lt;p&gt;The design of efficient copper(Cu)-based catalysts is critical for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction into multiple carbon products. However, most Cu-based catalysts are favorable for ethylene production while selective production of ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency and current density still remains a great challenge. Herein, we design a carbon-coated CuO&lt;sub&gt;

Impressively, the partial current density of ethanol reaches 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is higher than that of most reported catalysts. Operando Raman spectra indicate that the carbon coating can efficiently stabilize Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction conditions, which promotes the C&#8722;C coupling step.

         <title>Tuning the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Polymerization through Cocrystallization of the Monomer with an Inert Isostere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the regioselectivity of topochemical reactions is challenging as they occur under reagent&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. Employing a cocrystal strategy, we rationally tuned the regiochemistry of a topochemical polymerization. A monomer, known to polymerize topochemically to give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of two differently linked polymers, was cocrystallized with a dummy molecule. This cocrystal underwent topochemical polymerization regioselectively.







Abstract
Regiochemistry of topochemical reactions depends on the crystal packing and biasing the regiochemistry necessitates precise crystal engineering. The pristine crystals of monomer 1 upon topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymers due to the presence of two self&#8208;sorted reactive conformers in the crystal. We designed a binary isomorphous cocrystal of monomer 1 and a structurally similar dummy molecule 2 to limit the number of reactive conformers of 1 to one and thus to get one type of polymer. Equimolar solution of 1 and 2 in chloroform&#8208;acetone mixture gave two 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals Co&#8208;I and Co&#8208;II. The Co&#8208;II, a chloroform adduct, on heating undergoes desolvation and polymorphic transition to Co&#8208;I. Co&#8208;I is isomorphic to 1 and 2 and possess self&#8208;sorted arrays of 1 and 2. Heating Co&#8208;I results in the TAAC polymerization giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer of 1 selectively, showing the power of crystal engineering in regiocontrol.

         <title>Fano Resonance in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers the first direct observation of the Fano resonance effect in single&#8208;molecule junctions by the charge injection on the nitrogen atom using an EC&#8208;STM&#8208;BJ technique at room temperature, which provides a facile way to manipulate electron tunneling in the single&#8208;molecule junctions and opens a new avenue toward the design of interference&#8208;based molecular electronic devices.







Abstract
The Fano resonance in single&#8208;molecule junctions could be created by interaction with discrete and continuous molecular orbitals and enables effective electron transport modulation between constructive and destructive interference within a small energy range. However, direct observation of Fano resonance remains unexplored because of the disappearance of discrete orbitals by molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We demonstrated the room&#8208;temperature observation of Fano resonance from electrochemical gated single&#8208;molecule conductance and current&#8211;voltage measurements of a para&#8208;carbazole anion junction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the negative charge on the nitrogen atom induces a localized HOMO on the molecular center, creating Fano resonance by interfering with the delocalized LUMO on the molecular backbone. Our findings demonstrate that the Fano resonance in electron transport through single&#8208;molecule junctions opens pathways for designs of interference&#8208;based electronic devices.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Donor&#8208;Acceptor Strategy Enables Fast Spin&#8208;Flip of Multiple Resonance Emitters for Suppressing Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

A &#8220;space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy is presented to boost the kRISC of multiple resonance emitters to &#8764;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a high EQEmax of 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9&#8201;%).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have experienced great success in assembling narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of MR&#8208;emitters (103&#8211;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) that will lead to severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off has received extensive attention and remains a challenging issue. Herein, we put forward a &#8220;space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy to accelerate RISC process. The introduction of SCDA units onto the MR&#8208;skeleton induces intermediate triplet states, which leads to a multichannel RISC process and thus increases kRISC. As illustrated examples, efficient MR&#8208;emitters have been developed with a sub&#8208;microsecond delayed lifetime and a high kRISC of 2.13&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) as high as 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Direct Arene Trifluoromethylation Enabled by a High&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound enables direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes for the first time. Thermolysis of CuIII&#8722;CF3 bond provides concurrently CF3 radical and a CuII oxidant, which synergistically engage in a SEAr type reaction with arenes. This study establishes an unprecedented fundamental reactivity of CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds, and thus represents a significant progress for CuIII chemistry.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes poses an important synthetic challenge that is highly desirable. High&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds have often been invoked in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation reactions, but the fundamental reactivity toward arenes is elusive. Herein, direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes by a high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound is disclosed for the first time. The CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound serves CF3 radical and a CuII oxidant by homolytic cleavage of a CuIII&#8722;CF3 bond, which engage synergistically in a SEAr type reaction with arenes. The presence of K2S2O8 co&#8208;oxidant can significantly improve the reaction yields. This reaction shows good efficiency, broad functional group tolerance, and the potential in late&#8208;stage functionalization. The reactivity of high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds disclosed in this study represents an important progress in organofluorine and CuIII chemistry.

Thermolysis of Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond provides concurrently CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical and a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; oxidant, which synergistically engage in a S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;Ar type reaction with arenes. This study establishes an unprecedented fundamental reactivity of Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds, and thus represents a significant progress for Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes poses an important synthetic challenge that is highly desirable. High-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds have often been invoked in copper-mediated trifluoromethylation reactions, but the fundamental reactivity toward arenes is elusive. Herein, direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes by a high-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compound is disclosed for the first time. The Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compound serves CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical and a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; oxidant by homolytic cleavage of a Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond, which engage synergistically in a S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;Ar type reaction with arenes. The presence of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; co-oxidant can significantly improve the reaction yields. This reaction shows good efficiency, broad functional group tolerance, and the potential in late-stage functionalization. The reactivity of high-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds disclosed in this study represents an important progress in organofluorine and Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Character of &#945;,3&#8208;Dehydrotoluene Intermediates Generated from Isolable Allenyne&#8208;Containing Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;,3&#8208;Dehydroluenes (DHT), a relatively rare class of reactive intermediate(s), can be formed by warming isolable allenynes bearing a remote alkyne or nitrile. The product distributions produced in solvents of different polarity give insight to the electronic nature/structure of the DHTs (zwitterion vs. diradical vs. cyclic allene).







Abstract
We report here the generation of &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluenes, a relatively rare subset of reactive intermediates of the dehydroaromatic family, from isolable allenynes. The substructure motif in the allenyne substrates is distinct from, and complementary to, those found in Myers&#8208;Saito/Schmittel&#8208;type cycloisomerizations. The reactions reported here give rise to product profiles that provide insight about the electronic nature (i.e., diradical vs. zwitterion vs. cyclic allene) of the particular isomeric DHT(s) that is(are) produced under different reaction conditions differing most significantly in the polarity of the reaction solvent. One example also revealed previously unobserved carbene&#8208;like reactivity of the DHT.

         <title>Bright and Photostable Fluorescent Metal Nanocluster Supraparticles from Invert Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are formed by drying the water droplets in invert emulsions, resulting in a profoundly enhanced photoluminescence emission and resistance to photobleaching. The supraparticle structure greatly enhances the performance, where the inhibition of the twisted intermolecular charge transfer is one of the responsible causes.







Abstract
Fluorescent supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are synthesized by simply drying of invert emulsions, resulting in a dozen&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (up to &#8776;80&#8201;%) and a significant improvement in photostability. The inhibition of the ligand twisting during the intramolecular charge transfer is found to be responsible for the enhancement, especially for the gold nanocluster supraparticles. This research provides a general, flexible, and easy method for producing highly luminescent and photostable metal nanocluster&#8208;based materials that promise practical applications in white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Acrylamides via Lewis&#8208;Base&#8208;Mediated Aryl/Hydrogen Exchange</title>

         <dc:description>
A DABCO&#8208;induced polar aryl migration allows for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides from sulfonyl acrylimides. This reaction proceeds through a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange, including SO2 loss. A range of valuable building blocks have been synthesised and the underlying reaction mechanism has been explored using quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides leveraging polar S&#8208;to&#8208;C aryl migrations induced by a Lewis basic organocatalyst. In contrast to previously reported radical aryl migrations of sulfonyl acrylimides, this polar process enables subsequent elimination, ultimately leading to a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange including SO2 extrusion. This reaction is selective for electron&#8208;deficient aromatic groups, while tolerating a variety of substituents on nitrogen and in the &#946;&#8208;position, and it delivers useful building blocks for further transformations, including cycloaddition and cyclisation reactions. The mechanism was investigated in detail using quantum chemical calculations, which unexpectedly revealed the Lewis base to be involved in several decisive steps.

         <title>pH&#8208;Induced Symmetry Conversion of DNA Origami Lattices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motifs, like i&#8208;motif sequence, can be inserted into prescribed dimensions through strict dimensional manipulation strategy, to trigger in situ reversible expansion and shrinkage in 3D DNA origami frameworks.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has provided credible approaches for assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lattices with complex patterns. However, the symmetries are strictly dependent on their initial configurations and difficult to alter via non&#8208;thermal treatments. While switchable nucleic acid structures have been employed to construct deformable DNA motifs, it remains challenging to arrange them anisotropically in 3D lattices to trigger directed collective shape transition and dynamic symmetry conversion. In this work, we used octahedral DNA origami frames to synthesize four DNA origami lattices by placing the pH&#8208;reactive i&#8208;motif sequences in the desired dimensions. Thereinto, lattices with an anisotropic design can switch between simple cubic (SC) and simple tetragonal (ST) upon pH change. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results reveal the feasibility of obtaining 3D lattices with sensitive responses to external stimuli, expanding the way to obtain low&#8208;symmetry lattices.

         <title>Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Interactions Support a Robust Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Gold(I) Complex for OLEDs with Little Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off and Good Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust mononuclear AuI emitters are prepared by harnessing intramolecular Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions. The new emitter displays appealing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as well as thermal and photo&#8208;stability, leading to high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off and good operational stability. This work shows the potential of secondary interactions for developing optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
The practical use of luminescent mononuclear gold(I) complexes as optoelectronic materials has been limited by their inferior stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to improve the stability of gold(I) complexes which display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). A highly rigid and groove&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;donating aryl ligand has been used to form dual Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The secondary metal&#8208;ligand interactions have been authenticated by single&#8208;crystal structure, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The TADF AuI complex exhibits appealing emission properties (photoluminescence quantum yield=76&#8201;%; delayed fluorescence lifetime=1.2&#8197;&#956;s) and much improved thermal and photo&#8208;stability. Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promising electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 23&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. An estimated LT50 longer than 77&#8201;000&#8197;h with initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 reveals good operational stability.

     alt="Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Interactions Support a Robust Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Gold(I) Complex for OLEDs with Little Efficiency Roll-Off and Good Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust mononuclear Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters are prepared by harnessing intramolecular Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions. The new emitter displays appealing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as well as thermal and photo-stability, leading to high-performance organic light-emitting diodes with negligible efficiency roll-off and good operational stability. This work shows the potential of secondary interactions for developing optoelectronic materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical use of luminescent mononuclear gold(I) complexes as optoelectronic materials has been limited by their inferior stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to improve the stability of gold(I) complexes which display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). A highly rigid and groove-like &#963;-donating aryl ligand has been used to form dual Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The secondary metal-ligand interactions have been authenticated by single-crystal structure, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The TADF Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex exhibits appealing emission properties (photoluminescence quantum yield=76&#8201;%; delayed fluorescence lifetime=1.2&#8197;&#956;s) and much improved thermal and photo-stability. Vacuum-deposited organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promising electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 23&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll-off even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. An estimated LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; longer than 77&#8201;000&#8197;h with initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; reveals good operational stability. This work suggests a way for design of stable luminescent gold(I) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rebuilding&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Strategy Enables Ultrasensitive Genotyping, N&#8208;in&#8208;1 Logic Screening and Accurate Multiplex Assay of Dangerous Pathogens</title>

         <dc:description>
We implement a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal pathogen detection strategy based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective isothermal amplification. This strategy can greatly save detection cost and time, and avoid cross&#8208;interference.







Abstract
Sensitive, rapid and low&#8208;cost nucleic acid detection is critical for controlling infectious pathogens. Here, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal detection based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective strategy named dual hairpin ligation&#8208;induced isothermal amplification pro (DHLApro). Taking influenza A, influenza B, MERS&#8208;CoV, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as model targets, we demonstrate DHLApro provides &#8776;zM level ultra&#8208;sensitivity, being equaling to 0.45&#8197;copy/&#956;L in original sample. By simply changing the recognition module, a set of DHLApro components can be applied to a new target without performance loss. Moreover, DHLApro innovatively allows flexible logic/multiplex assay using one set of primer, for example, the &#8220;N pathogens&#8208;in&#8208;1&#8221; OR gate screening and accurate multi&#8208;channel multiplex assay. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross&#8208;interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.

         <title>1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ca2+:Cu2+ A&#8208;site Order in a Ferrimagnetic Double Double Perovskite</title>

CaCuFeReO6 adopts the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. Ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins is observed at TC=567&#8197;K and the magnetoresistance displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases.







Abstract
Cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we report discovery of CaCuFeReO6 with the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. CaCuFeReO6 occurs in the same phase field as CaCu3Fe2Re2O12 demonstrating that different A&#8208;cation ordered peroskites may be obtained in the same chemical system. CaCuFeReO6 has ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins below TC=567&#8197;K, in contrast to Mn analogues where the Mn spins order separately at much lower temperatures. The magnetoresistance of CaCuFeReO6 displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases. Many more AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites may be accessible for A&#8242;=Cu and other divalent transition metals at high pressure, so the presently known phases likely represent only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; for this family.

         <title>Molecular Electrochemical Reductive Splitting of Dinitrogen with a Molybdenum Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N2 splitting is achieved with a simple Mo complex at a carbon electrode. Controlled reduction (a 3 electron transfer process) at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (vs. SCE) and ambient conditions (room T and atmospheric P) afforded a Mo nitride complex in 30&#8201;% yield. DFT studies support the transient formation of a MoI&#8722;N2&#8722;MoI bridging dimer.







Abstract
Nitrogen reduction under mild conditions (room T and atmospheric P), using a non&#8208;fossil source of hydrogen remains a challenge. Molecular metal complexes, notably Mo based, have recently been shown to be active for such nitrogen fixation. We report electrochemical N2 splitting with a MoIII triphosphino complex [(PPP)MoI3], at room temperature and a moderately negative potential. A MoIV nitride species was generated, which is confirmed by electrochemistry and NMR studies. The reaction goes through two successive one electron reductions of the starting Mo species, coordination of a N2 molecule, and further splitting to a MoIV nitride complex. Preliminary DFT studies support the formation of a bridging MoIN2MoI dinitrogen dimer evolving to the Mo nitride via a low energy transition state. This example joins a short list of molecular complexes for N2 electrochemical reductive cleavage. It opens a door to electrochemical proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) conversion studies of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids to Derivatize or Degrade Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;driven direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acid side chains in macromolecules was explored as a robust post&#8208;polymerization modification strategy. Multiple transformations of copolymers were achieved, including derivatization with olefin units, functionalization with pendent alkenes, and backbone degradation. These decarboxylative processes were rapid, selective, and displayed high atom economy.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;mediated direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acids with an acridine photocatalyst is a convenient and powerful method to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals in polymer chains. Advantageously, this process proceeds under mild conditions, without preactivation of the acid groups. We utilize decarboxylation in the presence of a hydrogen atom donor to form statistical acrylate&#8208;ethylene and acrylate&#8208;propylene copolymers, which are challenging to obtain by direct polymerization. We additionally show that decarboxylation of methacrylic acid units within polymethacrylates can trigger degradation of the polymer backbones. Moreover, a dual catalytic approach, which combines the function of an acridine photocatalyst with that of a cobaloxime catalyst, is leveraged to furnish unique copolymers with pendent alkenes. Our work indicates that direct decarboxylation is a versatile technique for the synthesis of functional materials with tailored compositions and properties.

         <title>Integrating Light&#8208;Harvesting Ruthenium(II)&#8208;based Units into Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional metal covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs) with stp topology were constructed by integrating ruthenium(II)&#8208;based units in the skeleton, which exhibited superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability and excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (20&#8201;308&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
Three metal covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), namely RuCOF&#8208;ETTA, RuCOF&#8208;TPB and RuCOF&#8208;ETTBA, were synthesized by incorporating the photosensitive RuII tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) unit into the skeleton. Interestingly, each RuCOF contains three isostructural covalent organic frameworks that interlock together with the RuII centers serving as point of registry. The covalently linked network coupling with uniformly distributed RuII units allowed the RuCOFs to exhibit superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, and high photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution (20&#8201;308&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work illustrates the potential of developing versatile MCOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts from functionalized metal complex building unit and further enriches the MCOFs family.

         <title>Proton Chemistry Induced Long&#8208;Cycle Air Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 40, October 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) battery was developed in acidic electrolyte. The Pb/PTO batteries display excellent cycle stability during repeated self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging process because the self&#8208;charging behavior in acidic medium can effectively avoid the formation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrode.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries usually suffer from capacity loss after self&#8208;charging cycles due to the formation of basic salts on cathodes in the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Here, air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries based on proton chemistry are developed in acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of H+ uptake/removal endows the battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. Owing to the high standard electrode potential of oxygen in acid electrolyte, the discharged cathodes are spontaneously oxidized by oxygen in air along with H+ extraction and thus achieve self&#8208;charging without external power supply. Notably, the air self&#8208;charging mechanism involved H+&#8208;based redox can effectively avoid the generation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrodes and thus guarantee long&#8208;term self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging cycles of Pb/PTO batteries. This work provides a promising strategy for designing long&#8208;cycle air self&#8208;charging systems.

         <title>Taming Heavier Group 14 Imine Analogues: Accessing Tin Nitrogen [Sn=N] Double Bonds and their Cycloaddition/Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic study to access stable stannaimines is reported, by combining different heteroleptic stannylenes with a range of organic azides. The reactions of terphenyl&#8208;/hypersilyl&#8208;substituted stannylenes yield the putative tin nitrogen double bond, but is directly followed by 1,2&#8208;silyl migration to give Sn(II) systems featuring bulky silylamido ligands. By contrast, the transition from a two V donor ligand set to a mixed V&#8208;donor / S&#8208;donor scaffold allows access to three new stannaimines which can be handled at room temperature. The reactivity profile of these Sn=N bonded species is crucially dependent on the substituent at the nitrogen atom. As such, the Sn=NMes system is capable of activating a broad range of substrates under ambient conditions via 1,2&#8208;addition reactions, [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Most interestingly, very rare examples of main group multiple bond metathesis reactions are also found to be viable.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe  c  ooperative bimetallic catalysis that enables regio&#8208;/stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylations of aldimine esters.  By employing Et  3  B as the key activator, racemic allylic alcohols can be directly ionized to form Pd or Ir&#8208;  p&#8208;allyl species in the presence of achiral Pd or chiral Ir complexes, respectively. The less or more substituted allylic termini of the metal&#8208;p&#8208;allyl species are amenable to  nucleophilic  attack  by the chiral Cu&#8208;azomethine ylide  , the formation of which is simultaneously facilitated by Et  3  B, affording &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high regioselectivity and excellent stereoselectivity.  The use of readily available allylic alcohols as electrophilic precursors represents an improvement from an environmental and atom/step economy perspective  . Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et  3  B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.</dc:description>

Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et  3  B additive and the origins of stereo- and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helical Molecular Springs with Varying Spring Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general synthetic route toward freeform helical ladder polymers with&#160; varying &#160;spring constants, built with chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape&#8208;persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs. Our synthesis is adaptable to helices with different pitch and diameter, which allowed us to investigate how molecular flexibility in solution depends on the exact geometry of the ladder polymers. Specifically, we showed with molecular dynamic simulations and by measuring the longitudinal&#160;  1  H NMR relaxation times (  T  1  ) for our polymers at different Larmor frequencies, that increasing the helix diameter leads to increased flexibility. Our results present initial design rules for tuning the mechanical properties of intrinsically helical ladder polymers in solution, which will help inspire a new class of robust, spring&#8208;like molecular materials with&#160; varying mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitride complexes have recently been proposed as an efficient noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for ammonia synthesis utilizing a dual active site concept. However, their high sensitivity to air and moisture restricted potential applications. Here, we report that their chemical sensitivity can be improved by introducing Al into LaN lattice that form La&#8208;Al metallic bond (La&#8208;Al&#8208;N). The catalytic activity and mechanism of the resulting  TM  /La&#8208;Al&#8208;N (  TM  = Ni, Co) are comparable to the previously reported  TM  /LaN catalyst. Notably, the catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture. Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La&#8208;Al&#8208;N is responsible for N  2  absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of lattice N remained largely unchanged. These findings show the effectiveness of metallic bond formation, allowing rare&#8208;earth&#8208;nitride to co&#8208;host chemical stability and catalytic functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network without Creep: Mission Impossible?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent polymer networks provide an interesting solution to the challenging recyclability of thermosets and elastomers. One of the remaining design constraints, however, is balancing thermal reprocessability in the form of material flow with dimensional stability during use. As a result, many chemistries are being investigated in order to improve bond reactivity control and material robustness. This perspective highlights a number of promising concepts, with a particular emphasis on disconnecting chemical reactivity in low and high temperature regimes to obtain creep resistant, yet highly dynamic polymer networks. In addition, we will highlight the impact of sharp reactivity changes when applying extrapolation&#8208;based approaches during rheological analysis. As a result, we are confident that abandoning the myth of 'permanent' reactivity will aid in the development of sustainable polymeric materials that can truly combine the benefits of thermoplastic and thermoset behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#176; to 125.3&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically require expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such transformation is relevant for industry as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine chemicals due to the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different set of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes avoiding the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last years paving the way for generating more sustainable protocols including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes utilizing more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>H+&#8208;H&#8208; Pairs in Partial Oxidized MAX Phases for Bifunctional Catalytic Conversion of Furfurals into Linear Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the less favorable C=O hydrogenation and weak concerted acid catalysis cause unsatisfactory catalytic performance in the upgrading biomass&#8208;derived furfurals (i.e., furfural, 5&#8208;methyl furfural, and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural) to ketones (i.e., cyclopentanone, 2,5&#8208;hexanedione, and 1&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;hexanedione). Herein, a series of  partial oxidized MAX phase  (i.e., Ti  3  AlC  2  , Ti  2  AlC, Ti  3  SiC  2  ) supported Pd catalysts were fabricated, which showed high catalytic activity, particularly the Pd/Ti  3  AlC  2  displayed high efficiency to the target ketones. Detailed studies of catalytic mechanism confirm that in situ hydrogen spillover generates Frustrated Lewis H  +  &#8208;H  &#8722;  pairs, which not only act as the hydrogenation sites for the selective C=O hydrogenation but also provide acid sites for the ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites largely promote the bifunctional catalytic reactions, substantially reducing the reported minimum reaction temperature of various furfurals by at least 30&#8211;60 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical assembly of a micro&#8208; and macroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic molecular framework with tailored single&#8208;crystal size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>:  Porous organic molecular materials represent an emergent field of research in Chemistry and Materials Science due to their unique combination of properties. To enhance their performance and expand the number of applications, the incorporation of hierarchical porosity is required, as exclusive microporosity entails several limitations. However, the integration of macropores in porous organic molecular materials is still an outstanding challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (  MM&#8208;TPY  )  with hierarchical skeletal morphology, containing stable micro&#8208; and macroporosity. The crystal size, from micro to centimetre scale, can be controlled in a single step without using additives or templates.  The mechanism of assembly during the crystal formation is compatible with a skeletal crystal growt  h. As proof of concept, we employed the hierarchical porosity as a platform for the dual, sequential and selective co&#8208;recognition of molecular species and microparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State Creutz&#8208;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excited&#8208;state version of the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion was prepared via visible light excitation of [(NH  3  )  5  Ru  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;pz)Ru  II  (NH  3  )  5  ]  4+  . The resulting excited state is a mixed valence {Ru  III&#8211;&#948;  (  &#956;  &#8208;pz  &#8226;&#8211;  )Ru  II+&#948;  } transient species, which was characterized using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with vis&#8208;NIR detection. Very intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfers were observed at 7500 cm  &#8208;1  , revealing an excited&#8208;state electronic coupling element H  DA  = 3750 cm  &#8208;1  . DFT calculations confirm a strongly delocalized excited state. A notable consequence of strong electron delocalization is the nanosecond excited state lifetime, which was exploited in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept intermolecular electron transfer. The excited&#8208;state Creutz&#8208;Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli responsive silylene: Electromerism induced reversible switching between mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromerism is a very well&#8208;known phenomenon in transition metal chemistry. In main group chemistry, this concept has only started getting attention recently. We report stimuli responsive low&#8208;valent silicon compounds exhibiting electromerism. A mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8208;silylene  1  , [  L  Si&#8208;Si(NDipp)  L  ] (  L  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ), was synthesized in a single step from amidinate&#8208;chlorosilylene. Compound  1  has two interconnected Si atoms in formally +I and +III oxidation states. Upon treatment with Lewis acidic Cu(I)X (X = Mesityl, Cl, Br, I), electron redistribution occurs resulting in the formation of [{  L  Si(NDipp)Si(  L  )}&#8208;CuX], in which both silicon atoms are in the +II formal oxidation state. Removal of the copper center from [{  L  Si(NDipp)Si(  L  )}&#8208;CuX] by using a Lewis basic carbene led to reformation of the precursor [  L  Si&#8208;Si(NDipp)  L  ]. Thus, the process is fully reversible. This showcases the first example of Lewis acid/base induced reversible electromerism in silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a  de novo  designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH 7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH 3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 Labeling Constitutes a Sensitive 19F NMR Probe for&#160;Characterization of Interactions in the Minor Groove of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated nucleotides are invaluable for  19F NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and function. Here, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  &#8208;thymidine (T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  ) and incorporated it into DNA by means of solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis. NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  &#8208;DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high  19F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  make it a valuable  19F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;couplings follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that were reported to undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretic and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible&#8208;light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;couplings. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (  E  )&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the  E/Z  selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs  2  CO  3  ) to obtain more stable intermediates and evaluate the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Topology&#8208;Defined Polyester Elastomer from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: A One&#8208;Pot&#8208;One&#8208;Step &#8220;Scrambling Polymerizations&#8221; Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is significant and challenging to use CO  2  to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO  2  &#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break &gt; 600% is able to be used as an elastomer. The communication proposes a method to provide polyester elastomer from CO  2  and olefins for the first time, and expands the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Germapyramidane Switches Between 3D Cluster and 2D Cyclic Structures in Single Electron Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;substituted diphosphete&#8208;diide, (IPr)2C2P2 (IDP), with GeCl2&#8729;dioxane and KBArF24 [(BArF24)&#8722; = tetrakis[(3,5&#8208;trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate)] afforded the dicationic spherical&#8208;aromatic nido&#8208;cluster [Ge(&#951;4&#8208;IDP)]2+ ([1]2+) (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). This complex is a rare heavy analogue of the elusive pyramidane [C(&#951;4&#8208;C4H4)]. [1]2+ undergoes two reversible one&#8208;electron reductions which yield the radical cation [2] &#8226;+  and the neutral Ge(II) species 3. Both [2] &#8226;+  and 3 rearrange in solution forming the 2D aromatic and planar imidazolium&#8208;substituted digermolide [4]2+ and germole&#8208;diide 5, respectively. Both planar species can be oxidized back to [1]2+ using AgSbF6. These redox&#8208;isomerizations correspond to the fundamental transformation of a 3D aromatic cluster into a 2D aromatic ring compound upon reduction and vice versa. The mechanism of these reactions was elucidated using DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspective for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We wish that this minireview can provide inspirations in the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report here a new method for synthesis of densely functionalized chiral allyl SCF  3  , SCF  2  R, SCN and SAr species with a separate CF  3  functionality. The synthetic approach is based on selenium catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of chiral &#945;&#8208;CF  3  allylboronic acids. The reactions proceeded with remarkably high stereo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and site selectivity based on formation of a stable thiiranium ion followed by rapid deborylative ring opening.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Isoxazole as a Native Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker for Photoaffinity Labeling and Chemoproteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique to interrogate drug&#8208;protein interactions in native cellular environments. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers are instrumental for this technique. However, the introduction of unnatural photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers may significantly reduce the bioactivity of the drug, thus impairing the chemoproteomic outcomes. Herein, we developed a common pharmacophore, isoxazole, into a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics, which minimally perturbs the drug structure. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking reactions of the isoxazole were thoroughly investigated for the first time. Functionalized isoxazoles were then designed and applied to protein labeling, demonstrating the superior photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking efficiency. Subsequently, two isoxazole&#8208;based drugs, Danazol and Luminespib, were employed in chemoproteomic studies, revealing their potential cellular targets. These results provide valuable strategies for future chemoproteomic study and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Based Engineering of the Active Pocket of D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase Leading to Highly Improved Specificity toward D&#8208;Glufosinate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its stringent stereospecificity, D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has made it incredibly easy to synthesize L&#8208;amino acids. However, the wild&#8208;type enzyme's low activity toward unnatural substrates like D&#8208;glufosinate (D&#8208;PPT) restricts its application. Herein, DAAO from  Rhodotorula gracilis  (  Rg  DAAO) was directly evolved using a hydrophilicity&#8208;substitution saturation mutagenesis strategy, yielding a mutant with significantly increased catalytic activity against D&#8208;PPT. The mutant displays distinctive catalytic properties to hydrophilic substrates compared to numerous WT&#8208;DAAOs. The analysis of homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate that the extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity was the reason for the enhanced activity. The current study established an enzymatic synthetic route to L&#8208;PPT, an excellent herbicide, with high efficiency, and the proposed strategy provided a new viewpoint on enzyme engineering for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids.</dc:description>

Abstract
Post&#8208;modification of robust guanine&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;linked 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;containing HOF&#8208;25 with Ni(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O followed by exfoliation using sonication method affords hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanosheets (NSs) of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni in the yield of 56&#8201;%. TEM and AFM technologies disclose the ultrathin nature of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni NSs with thickness of 4.4&#8197;nm. STM observation determines the presence of sql segments assembled from HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni building blocks at the heptanoic acid/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite interface, supporting the simulated 2D supramolecular framework.

         <title>Simultaneous Photoactivation of cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Pyroptosis by Platinum (II) Triphenylamine Complexes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small molecule that can activate cGAS&#8208;STING in a photocontrollable way is reported. Upon irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 can damage mitochondrial DNA, the nuclear envelope and nuclear DNA sequentially, which effectively releases DNA into cytoplasm to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway is a potent anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy, and the induction of pyroptosis is a feasible way to stimulate the anticancer immune responses. Herein, two PtII complexes (Pt1 and Pt2) were designed as photoactivators of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In response to light irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 could damage mitochondrial/nuclear DNA and the nuclear envelope to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and concurrently induce pyroptosis in cancer cells, which evoked an intense anticancer immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Overall, we present the first photoactivator of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, which may provide an innovative design strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>In Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle was achieved by dark&#8208;field microscopy and disclosed the transformation of amorphous SeNPs into polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2.







Abstract
Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.

         <title>Ultrasmall Copper Nanoclusters in Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature synthetic strategy is reported for incorporation of ultrasmall Cu nanoclusters into a series of robust Zr&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The resultant core&#8211;shell composites mediate CO2 photoreduction selectively and outperform similar composites even with variable Cu spatial distribution.







Abstract
Encapsulating ultrasmall Cu nanoparticles inside Zr&#8208;MOFs to form core&#8211;shell architecture is very challenging but of interest for CO2 reduction. We report for the first time the incorporation of ultrasmall Cu NCs into a series of benchmark Zr&#8208;MOFs, without Cu NCs aggregation, via a scalable room temperature fabrication approach. The Cu NCs@MOFs core&#8211;shell composites show much enhanced reactivity in comparison to the Cu NCs confined in the pore of MOFs, regardless of their very similar intrinsic properties at the atomic level. Moreover, introducing polar groups on the MOF structure can further improve both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the CuI sites located at the interface between Cu NCs and support serve as the active sites and efficiently catalyze CO2 photoreduction. This synergetic effect may pave the way for the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient catalysts for CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;value chemical feedstock.

&lt;p&gt;A room-temperature synthetic strategy is reported for incorporation of ultrasmall Cu nanoclusters into a series of robust Zr-metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The resultant core&#8211;shell composites mediate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction selectively and outperform similar composites even with variable Cu spatial distribution.

         <title>Regioselective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8722;H Borylation: A Subject of Practical and Ongoing Interest in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in strategies for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation are summarized in this Review. Strategies developed to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic borylation, such as approaches controlled by electronic effects, auxiliaries, and steric factors, are also discussed. EDG=electron donating group, DG=directing group, TM=transition metal.







Abstract
Considerable advances have been made in the area of C&#8722;H functionalization in the last few decades. A number of approaches including both directed and nondirected strategies have been developed thus far. Among the various C&#8722;H functionalizations, C&#8722;H borylation is of special interest due to the wide applications of organoboron compounds. In this regard, various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective strategies have been developed. However, the major concern regarding metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation procedures is the requirement of a precious metal as well as the contamination by metal precursors in the desired products, which limit the application of this process in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, recent trends have involved the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems. We summarize recent developments in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation. We believe that this Review will help to increase interest in this field and stimulate further progress.

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can directly quantify the overall structure parameters of nanoclusters in solution without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization. A series of silver and gold nanoclusters were studied with SANS demonstrating good agreement with crystallographic data in both the shape, size and the molecular weight information.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula can be precisely determinated from mass spectroscopy. However, a complete structure characterization by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution. The results not only correlate well to their crystallographic structures, but also allow the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.

         <title>Understanding the Nature and Strength of Noncovalent Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new series of fullerene&#8208;based molecular torsion balances and examined their folding equilibrium to understand the nature and strength of noncovalent face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8722;fullerene interactions. The contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions were experimentally quantified by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.







Abstract
Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8722;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.

         <title>Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron, its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a tessellated triangle T1 and the construction of a tessellated octahedron O1 containing metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels are demonstrated. O1 has a diameter on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and a molecular weight greater than 84&#8197;kDa. After hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and compounds with advanced functions. Whereas two&#8208;dimensional supramolecules with complex and giant skeletons are plentiful, the constructions of polyhedrons are limited by using basic polygons as the panels. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tessellated triangle and tessellated octahedron with metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels and formed via template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These architectures have diameters on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and molecular weights greater than 84&#8197;kDa. Interestingly, fiber and spherical&#8208;like nanostructures could be formed from the tessellated triangles and octahedrons, respectively, through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. In addition, after hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.

         <title>Anticancer Approach Inspired by the Hepatotoxic Mechanism of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids with Glycosylated Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. We developed a therapeutic approach, in which a precursor is transformed into a synthetic DHP via 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization catalyzed by a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a glycosylated ArM suppressed cell growth of targeted cancer cells.







Abstract
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA&#8208;induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization using a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450.

&lt;p&gt;Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro-PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. We developed a therapeutic approach, in which a precursor is transformed into a synthetic DHP via &lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization catalyzed by a gold-based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). In cell-based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a glycosylated ArM suppressed cell growth of targeted cancer cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro-PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA-induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization using a gold-based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell-based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer-targeting glycosylated gold-based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Applications of Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Oxide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise of being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials with a small environmental footprint. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years, more complex oxides have emerged. This Review discusses different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials having a small environmental footprint and excellent performance, albeit inferior to that of noble metal counterparts. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years more complex oxides and added functionality have emerged with enhanced performance. We will discuss different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis. We pay special attention to discriminate between the role of free versus that of bound charges within the catalyst, which is crucial to disentangle the different contributions to the catalytic reaction for the benefit of the overall enhanced catalytic performance in e.g. wastewater treatment and ultimately water&#8208;splitting.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamidation of (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with excellent reaction scope by using oxalamides or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides as the ligands. For bromides, only 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% CuI and oxalamides were required. For chlorides, increasing catalytic loadings to 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu2O and ligands was needed. Direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs were achieved under these conditions.







Abstract
Direct N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing pharmaceutically important N&#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulting from the previous condensation method. Most known catalytic methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper salts and oxalamides at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the catalysis of Cu2O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>

A reversible and fast vapor&#8208;triggered mechanical response of an actuating composite film based on crystalline organic cages.







Abstract
The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (Oba&#8208;cage) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Morphological Anisotropy in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Micro/Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework micro/nanoparticles (MOF MNPs) are reviewed with a focus on their morphological anisotropy, which plays a unique role in producing innovative structures and regulating properties with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Anisotropy plays a unique role in the structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. However, there is a lack of a understanding of MOF micro/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the perspective of morphological anisotropy. In this Minireview, recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy leads to innovative structures and modulates properties. First, anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are introduced and classified by their morphology&#8208;dependent and morphology&#8208;independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy&#8208;enabled site&#8208;selective higher&#8208;order construction of MOF&#8208;based materials is highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for further developments in this interesting research field.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Recognition of Dicyanoaurate(I) by a Bambusuril Macrocycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bambusuril macrocycle is utilized for selective stripping of [Au(CN)2]&#8722; anion from activated carbon&#8212;a process relevant to industrial gold production. The efficient stripping is due to the complex of the macrocycle and [Au(CN)2]&#8722; formed at micromolar concentration in aqueous media.







Abstract
Dicyanoaurate(I) anion, [Au(CN)2]&#8722;, plays a central role in the current industrial production of gold, as its extraction from crude ore samples represents the most money&#8208;consuming step. Herein, we present the strongest host&#8211;guest recognition of dicyanoaurate anion using the bambusuril receptor in water, a highly competitive solvent. The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)2]&#8722; differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)2]&#8722; over [Ag(CN)2]&#8722;.

The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; over [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introducing the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand into Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* analogue [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; resisted all coordination attempts for more than 40&#8197;years. Now its first transition metal complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] is reported. The exceptionally weak binding character of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is proved by DFT calculations and substitution reactions with arenes, allowing to switch between ligand and weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
The reaction of AgBF4 and [Rh(COD)Cl]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the fluorocarbon soluble complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] by salt metathesis. This complex represents the first example for a successful coordination of the weakly basic [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand, since its first synthesis in 1980. In addition to [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] also the byproduct [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)4H)] was isolated and fully characterized. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the interaction energy of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand towards the 12&#8208;electron fragment [Rh(COD)]+ is &#8776;70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in comparison to [C5(CH3)5]&#8722; due to reduced electrostatic interactions and weaker &#960;&#8208;donor properties of the ligand. The quantitative but reversible substitution of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand by toluene, converting it into a weakly coordinating anion, experimentally proved the extraordinary weak bonding interaction.

         <title>Diterpene Biosynthesis from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogues with Changed Reactivities Expands Skeletal Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogues of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bond were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases. The double bond shift causes a change of reactivity that results in the formation of many diterpenes with novel skeletons. A total number of 28 new diterpenes is reported and their mechanism of formation is discussed.







Abstract
Two analogues of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bonds, named iso&#8208;GGPP I and iso&#8208;GGPP II, were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases from bacteria, fungi and protists. The changed reactivity in the substrate analogues resulted in the formation of 28 new diterpenes, many of which exhibit novel skeletons.
