         <title>Unlocking Charge Transfer Limitations for Extreme Fast Charging of Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme fast charging of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is achieved by simultaneously reducing the anode and cathode charge transfer energy barriers through electrolyte engineering. Ah&#8208;level commercial cells demonstrate rapid charging from 0 to 80&#8201;% state of charge (SOC) within 10 to 25&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Extreme fast charging (XFC) of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is a key enabler of electrified transportation. While previous studies mainly focused on improving Li ion mass transport in electrodes and electrolytes, the limitations of charge transfer across electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces remain underexplored. Herein we unravel how charge transfer kinetics dictates the fast rechargeability of Li&#8208;ion cells. Li ion transfer across the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is found to be rate&#8208;limiting during XFC, but the charge transfer energy barrier at both the cathode and anode have to be reduced simultaneously to prevent Li plating, which is achieved through electrolyte engineering. By unlocking charge transfer limitations, 184&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pouch cells demonstrate stable XFC (10&#8208;min charge to 80&#8201;%) which is otherwise unachievable, and the lifetime of 245&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 21700 cells is quintupled during fast charging (25&#8208;min charge to 80&#8201;%).

         <title>The Eschenmoser's Salt as a Formylation Agent for the Synthesis of Indolizinecarbaldehydes and Their Use for Colorimetric Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented use of the Eschemoser's salt&#8212;a well&#8208;known and commercial reagent for (dimethylamino)methylation reactions&#8212;as a formylation agent of indolizines. The method is simple and mild, whereas the classical formylation methods failed. Moreover, some indolizinecarbaldehydes have been transformed into highly conjugated push&#8208;pull dyes and have proven to be selective and sensitive colorimetric anion sensors for nitrite detection.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond formylation is the most immediate way to incorporate the versatile formyl group into (hetero)aromatics. However, the type of reagents and severe conditions involved in the classical formylation methods often curtail their application, especially in the presence of other functional groups. Herein, we present the Eschenmoser's salt, a commercially available (dimethylamino)methylating chemical, as a useful reagent for the C&#8722;H formylation of indolizines and other compounds. The method is straightforward and mild, furnishing indolizinecarbaldehydes in modest&#8208;to&#8208;good yields with exclusive and remote regioselectivity. Furthermore, these compounds can be easily transformed into push&#8208;pull dyes and are highly selective in the colorimetric detection of nitrite, a substance extensively employed as preservative in the food industry, the concentration of which is crucial to control to prevent harmful effects in living organisms. The assay is simple, allowing the naked&#8208;eye detection of nitrite in solution or on a cotton swab for a wide range of concentrations.

         <title>CAPturAM, a Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Strategy for Selective Enrichment and Detection of Physiological CAPAM&#8208;Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach, allows for direct enrichment and detection of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets by harnessing CAPAM's cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on all its targets. These are then functionalized with an affinity handle, enriched, and assessed via RT&#8208;qPCR.







Abstract
Modified nucleotides impact all aspects of eukaryotic mRNAs and contribute to regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level. At the 5&#8242; cap, adenosine as first transcribed nucleotide is often N6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl adenosine (m6Am). This modification is tissue dependent and reversible, pointing to a regulatory function. CAPAM was recently identified as methyltransferase responsible for m6Am formation, however, the direct assignment of its target transcripts proves difficult. Antibodies do not discriminate between internal N6&#8208;methyl adenosine (m6A) and m6Am. Here we present CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach for direct enrichment and probing of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets. We harness CAPAM's cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on its targets. Subsequent functionalization with an affinity handle allows for their enrichment. Using wildtype and CAPAM&#8722;/&#8722; cells, we successfully applied CAPturAM to confirm or disprove CAPAM&#8208;targets, facilitating the verification and identification of CAPAM targets.

         <title>Boraalkenes Made by a Hydroboration Route: Cycloaddition and B=C Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene hydroboration by the in situ generated IMes(X)BH+ cations followed by deprotonation gave the neutral boraalkenes. They underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with a variety of heterocumulenes among them carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide. A two&#8208;step reaction sequence led to the formal CS2 insertion product with complete rupture of the B=C double bond. A boraalkene/CO2 cycloaddition product opened its core B&#8722;C bond upon treatment with HB(C6F5)2.







Abstract
Hydroboration of styrene or vinylcyclohexane with the IMes(C6F5)BH+ cation followed by deprotonation provided a convenient synthetic entry to the [B]=CHCH2R boraalkenes 9&#8201;a and 9&#8201;b. The in situ generated IMes(SCN)BH+ system reacted similarly with 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene followed by deprotonation to give the isothiocyanato substituted boraalkene 9&#8201;c. The boraalkenes underwent [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with a small series of heterocumulenes to give the respective four&#8208;membered heterocycles. The [B]=CHCH2R+CO2 cycloadducts 13&#8201;a and 13&#8201;b added the borane HB(C6F5)2 with cleavage of the central B&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond. CS2 underwent an unusual reaction with the boraalkenes, namely insertion into the B=C bond with formation of the borylated dithioketene acetal under complete rupture of the strong B=C double bond. The intermediate dithiobora&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone type intermediate was isolated in the case of the isothiocyanato&#8208;boraalkene reaction and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Structure and Dynamics Landscape of Proteins in Mammalian Cells Revealed by In&#8208;Cell NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In buffer the NMR spectrum of a folded protein (A) shows no peak splitting effect due to the absence of multiple structural species. Inside cells (B) a subpopulation of the same protein binds different partners which results in structural changes leading to chemical shift perturbations of the cross peaks. The co&#8208;existence of these structurally different variants in cells leads to the peak splitting effect and the appearance of two daughter peaks.







Abstract
Governing function, half&#8208;life and subcellular localization, the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins are in nature constantly changing in a tightly regulated manner to fulfill the physiological and adaptive requirements of the cells. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we applied in&#8208;cell NMR to three folded model proteins and propose that the splitting of cross peaks constitutes an atomic fingerprint of distinct structural states that arise from multiple target binding co&#8208;existing inside mammalian cells. These structural states change upon protein loss of function or subcellular localisation into distinct cell compartments. In addition to peak splitting, we observed NMR signal intensity attenuations indicative of transient interactions with other molecules and dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Hybrid Neutral Lipids with Archaeal and Eukaryotic Characteristics in Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstitution of archaeal lipid biosynthesis in eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in unexpected production of hybrid neutral lipids, which contain both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids. The responsible enzymes, diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), were found to be present in all domains of life.







Abstract
Discovery of the Asgard superphylum of archaea provides new evidence supporting the two&#8208;domain model of life: eukaryotes originated from an Asgard&#8208;related archaeon that engulfed a bacterial endosymbiont. However, how eukaryotes acquired bacterial&#8208;like membrane lipids with a sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (G3P) backbone instead of the archaeal&#8208;like sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (G1P) backbone remains unknown. In this study, we reconstituted archaeal lipid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing unsaturated archaeol&#8208;synthesizing enzymes. Using Golden Gate cloning for pathway assembly, modular gene replacement was performed, revealing the potential biosynthesis of both G1P&#8208; and G3P&#8208;based unsaturated archaeol by uncultured Asgard archaea. Unexpectedly, hybrid neutral lipids containing both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids were observed in recombinant S. cerevisiae. The ability of yeast and archaeal diacylglycerol acyltransferases to synthesize such hybrid lipids was demonstrated.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Atomic Structure in Multivariate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Guiding Electrocatalysts Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique is utilized to visualize the structure and resolve the lattice strain information of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) at an atomic level, providing important guidance in the further design of MOFs for efficient OER.







Abstract
The direct utilization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we employ the low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique to visualize the atomic structure of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) for guiding the structural design of bulk MOFs for efficient OER. The iDPC&#8208;STEM images revealed that incorporating Fe3+ or 2&#8208;aminoterephthalate (ATA) into Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC: benzenedicarboxylate) can introduce inhomogeneous lattice strain that weaken the coordination bonds, which can be selectively cleaved via a mild heat treatment to simultaneously generate coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, conductive Ni@C and hierarchical porous structure. Thus, excellent OER activity with current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved over the defective MOFs at small overpotentials of 286&#8197;mV and 365&#8197;mV, respectively, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 catalyst and most of the bulk MOFs.

         <title>A Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid System to Manipulate the Cascade Reaction for Highly Selective Electrosynthesis of Aldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel liquid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid system was designed to manipulate the selectivity of cascade reaction and the selectivity for benzaldehyde is increased 200&#8208;fold compared with the traditional liquid&#8208;solid system. The produced benzaldehyde could be in situ extracted into the organic phase and separated from the complex electrolyte to achieve purification.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes from alcohols exhibits unique superiorities as a promising technology, in which cascade reactions are involved. However, the cascade reactions are severely limited by the low selectivity resulting from the peroxidation of aldehydes in a traditional liquid&#8208;solid system. Herein, we report a novel liquid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid system to regulate the selectivity of benzyl alcohol electrooxidation. The selectivity of benzaldehyde increases 200&#8208;fold from 0.4&#8201;% to 80.4&#8201;% compared with the liquid&#8208;solid system at a high current density of 136&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the highest one up to date. In the tri&#8208;phase system, the benzaldehyde peroxidation is suppressed efficiently, with the conversion of benzaldehyde being decreased from 87.6&#8201;% to 3.8&#8201;%. The as&#8208;produced benzaldehyde can be in situ extracted to toluene phase and separated from the electrolyte to get purified benzaldehyde. This strategy provides an efficient way to efficiently enhance the selectivity of electrocatalytic cascade reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Production of Nanoporous Block Copolymers with Arbitrary Structural Characteristics for Advanced Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pore&#8208;forming strategy has been developed for the fabrication of nanoporous block copolymers (BCPs) with arbitrary structural characteristics with 1&#8197;s soaking. This rapid, facile, and universal strategy can produce percolating nanopore structures in the polystyrene&#8208;based BCPs with various bulk morphologies, which inspires us to prepare advanced membranes derived from the CO2&#8208;based sustainable BCPs for fast molecular separation for the first time.







Abstract
The great significance of boosting the design of percolating nanopore structures in block copolymers (BCPs) for various cases has been widely demonstrated in the past several decades. However, it still remains challenging to prepare the desired porous structures in a rapid, facile, and universal manner. Here we have developed an unconventional and benchtop strategy to rapidly generate the nanoporous polystyrene&#8208;based BCPs with arbitrary structural characteristics regardless of the BCP bulk morphology. This universal pore&#8208;forming strategy enables the sustainable CO2&#8208;based BCPs to form advanced membranes after 1&#8197;s soaking for efficiently rejecting 94.2&#8201;% brilliant blue R (826&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Meanwhile, the water permeance retains around 1020&#8197;L&#8201;(m2&#8201;h&#8201;bar)&#8722;1, which is 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other membranes. This strategy may offer an excellent opportunity to introduce percolating pore structures in those newly developed BCPs with which the previously reported pore&#8208;forming methods may not deal.

Meanwhile, the water permeance retains around 1020&#8197;L&#8201;(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&#8201;bar)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other membranes. This strategy may offer an excellent opportunity to introduce percolating pore structures in those newly developed BCPs with which the previously reported pore-forming methods may not deal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Electrochemical Peptide Modifications: Unlocking New Levels of Orthogonality for Side&#8208;Chain Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The programmable electrochemical modification of peptides is enabled by designer electroauxiliaries which are readily compatible with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Anodic oxidation facilitates the functionalization of &#8220;electroactive&#8221; glutamine residues to deliver high&#8208;value peptide N,O&#8208;acetals. By dialing in the oxidation potential of distinct electroauxiliaries, the iterative and orthogonal functionalization of peptides is accomplished.







Abstract
Electrochemical transformations provide enticing opportunities for programmable, residue&#8208;specific peptide modifications. Herein, we harness the potential of amidic side&#8208;chains as underutilized handles for late&#8208;stage modification through the development of an electroauxiliary&#8208;assisted oxidation of glutamine residues within unprotected peptides. Glutamine building blocks bearing electroactive side&#8208;chain N,S&#8208;acetals are incorporated into peptides using standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. Anodic oxidation of the electroauxiliary in the presence of diverse alcohol nucleophiles enables the installation of high&#8208;value N,O&#8208;acetal functionalities. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for an electrochemical peptide stapling protocol, as well as the functionalization of dynorphin B, an endogenous opioid peptide, demonstrates the applicability of the method to intricate peptide systems. Finally, the site&#8208;selective and tunable electrochemical modification of a peptide bearing two discretely oxidizable sites is achieved.

         <title>Reversible Isomerization Between Silacyclopropyl Cation and Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation has been synthesized and fully characterized. Interestingly, this silacyclopropyl cation reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene at room temperature via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond. Although the silylene has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by various trapping reactions.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation 2 has been synthesized and fully characterized. Of particular interest, 2 reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene 3 at room temperature via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond. Although silylene 3 has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by the isolation of the corresponding disilene dimer 5 as well as by trapping reactions.

         <title>Diboraanthracene&#8208;Doped Polymer Systems for Colour&#8208;Tuneable Room&#8208;Temperature Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diboraanthracene compounds are presented as a new class of room temperature organic afterglow materials for colour&#8208;tuneable polymer&#8208;based systems. The afterglow consists of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), or organic afterglow, is a unique phenomenon, gaining widespread attention due to its far&#8208;reaching application potential and fundamental interest. Here, two laterally expanded 9,10&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) derivatives are demonstrated as excellent afterglow materials for red and blue&#8208;green light emission, which is traced back to persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and RTP. The lateral substitution of polycyclic DBA scaffold, together with weak transversal electron&#8208;donating mesityl groups, ensures the optimal molecular properties for (reverse) intersystem crossing and long&#8208;lived triplet states in a rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix. The achieved afterglow emission quantum yields of up to 3&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, afterglow lifetimes up to 0.8&#8197;s and 3.2&#8197;s and afterglow durations up to 5&#8197;s and 25&#8197;s (for red and blue&#8208;green emitters, respectively) are attributed to the properties of single molecules.

         <title>Crystalline Unipolymer Monolayer with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the ultimate goals in polymer science is how to approach physical limits such as density, modulus, conductivity, etc. Our work demonstrates the creation of crystalline polymer monolayers for approaching the physical limits of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline polymer with a well&#8208;defined orientated state and a two&#8208;dimensional crystalline size beyond a micrometer will be essential to achieve the highest physical feature of polymer material but remain challenging. Herein, we show the synthesis of the crystalline unipolymer monolayer with an unusual ultrahigh modulus that is higher than the ITO substrate and high conductance by simultaneous electrosynthesis and manipulation. We find that the polymer monolayer has fully extended in the vertical and unidirectional orientation, which is proposed to approach their theoretically highest density, modulus, and conductivity among all aggregation formations of the current polymer. The modulus and current density can reach 40 and 1000&#8197;times higher than their amorphous counterpart. It is also found that these monolayers exhibit the bias&#8208; and length&#8208;dependent multiple charge states and asymmetrically negative differential resistance (NDR) effect, indicating that this unique molecular tailoring and ordering design is promising for multilevel resistive memory devices. Our work demonstrates the creation of a crystalline polymer monolayer for approaching the physical limit of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks with Polyethylene Glycol as Self&#8208;Sustained Humidity&#8208;Responsive Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating rigid covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol generates rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators with outstanding humidity&#8208;responsive performance. These actuators exhibited interesting self&#8208;oscillating properties on the water surface, and can continuously generate electricity after coupling with a piezoelectric film.







Abstract
Regarding the global energy crisis, it is of profound significance to develop spontaneous power generators that harvest natural energy. Fabricating humidity&#8208;responsive actuators that can conduct such energy transduction is of paramount importance. Herein, we incorporate covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators. This strategy significantly improves the mechanical properties and humidity&#8208;responsive performance of the actuators, meanwhile, the existence of ordered structures enables us to unveil the actuation mechanism. These high&#8208;performance actuators can achieve various actuation applications and exhibit interesting self&#8208;oscillation behavior above a water surface. Finally, after being coupled with a piezoelectric film, the bilayer device can spontaneously output electricity over 2&#8197;days. This work paves a new avenue to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled actuators for self&#8208;sustained energy transduction.

This strategy significantly improves the mechanical properties and humidity-responsive performance of the actuators, meanwhile, the existence of ordered structures enables us to unveil the actuation mechanism. These high-performance actuators can achieve various actuation applications and exhibit interesting self-oscillation behavior above a water surface. Finally, after being coupled with a piezoelectric film, the bilayer device can spontaneously output electricity over 2&#8197;days. This work paves a new avenue to fabricate rigid-flexible coupled actuators for self-sustained energy transduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been realized. This reaction provided an efficient method to access a variety of chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes with two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters in good efficiency.







Abstract
We herein disclose a mild and efficient access to chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes. Various nucleophiles, such as alcohols, phenols, amines and water, are well compatible with the reaction system. This reaction forms three C&#8722;C bonds, two rings, two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters as well as one C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N bond with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The products could be further functionalized to generate a library of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks.

         <title>An Infectious Virus&#8208;like Particle Built on a Programmable Icosahedral DNA Framework
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;novo designed rigid icosahedral DNA framework was assembled to efficiently package single&#8208;stranded phage genome inside it. The packaging behavior was precisely regulated and systematically investigated. The entrapped ssDNA was available for molecular operations due to the structure&#8216;s permeability. Moreover, the phage mimetic particle could passively infect host bacteria and induce phage plaque.







Abstract
Viral genomes can be compressed into a near&#8208;spherical nanochamber to form infectious particles. In order to mimic the virus morphology and packaging behavior, we invented a programmable icosahedral DNA nanoframe with enhanced rigidity and encapsulated the phiX174 bacteriophage genome. The packaging efficiency could be modulated through specific anchoring strands adjustment, and the trapped phage genome remained accessible for enzymatic operations. Moreover, the packed complex could infect Escherichia coli (E.&#8197;coli) cells through bacterial uptake to produce plaques. This rigid icosahedral DNA architecture demonstrated a versatile platform to develop virus mimetic particles for convenient functional nucleic acid entrapment, manipulation and delivery.

         <title>Nine&#8208;Electron Transfer of Binder Synergistic &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ exhibits an ultra&#8208;high lithium storage capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfer and excellent rate performance due to its multiple redox active centers, &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and laminar structure. Meanwhile, the binder CMC, like an octopus, has an appropriate interaction with both the ligand and Ni2+ of Ni&#8208;DHBQ, thus reducing the solubility of Ni&#8208;DHBQ and enhancing its cycle life.







Abstract
To solve the problems such as the dissolution and the poor conductivity of organic small molecule electrode materials, we construct &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers as lithium storage materials. It exhibits an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfers, while the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and the laminar structure inside the crystal ensure fast electron transport and lithium ion diffusion, resulting in excellent rate performance (505.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles). The interaction of Ni&#8208;DHBQ with the binder CMC synergistically inhibits its dissolution and anchors the Ni atoms, thus exhibiting excellent cycling stability (650.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles). This work provides insight into the mechanism of lithium storage in &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers and the synergistic effect of CMC, which will contribute to the molecular design and commercial application of organic electrode materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Helical Nanofibrous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined, one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies are constructed for the first time involving a chiral aminal linkage. By adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis, the helicity of the resulting COF double helices can be readily inversed. Circularly polarized luminescence of the COF double helices is achieved via transferring chirality to achiral fluorophores.







Abstract
Despite significant progress on the design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), precise control over microstructures of such materials remains challenging. Herein, two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies were constructed via an unprecedented template&#8208;free method, capitalizing on the diastereoselective formation of aminal linkages. Detailed time&#8208;dependent experiments reveal the spontaneous transformation of initial rod&#8208;like aggregates into the double&#8208;helical microstructures. We have further demonstrated that the helical chirality and circular dichroism signal can be facilely inversed by simply adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis. Moreover, by transferring chirality to achiral fluorescent molecular adsorbents, the helical COF nanostructures can effectively induce circularly polarized luminescence with the highest luminescent asymmetric factor (glum) up to &#8776;0.01.

         <title>Mitigating Electron Leakage of Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have given insights into the electron leakage behavior that underlies the distinct SEI growth, by investigating the specific SEI component type/distribution in detail. The uniform SEI layer with favorable component and distribution is found to have both low electron driving force and high electron insulation. Therefore, the electron leakage causing SEI growth is largely restrained.







Abstract
The interfacial stability is highly responsible for the longevity and safety of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase(SEI) growth would deteriorate its stability. Essentially, the SEI growth is associated with the electron leakage behavior, yet few efforts have tried to suppress the SEI growth, from the perspective of mitigating electron leakage. Herein, we built two kinds of SEI layers with distinct growth behaviors, via the additive strategy. The SEI physicochemical features (morphology and componential information) and SEI electronic properties (LUMO level, band gap, electron work function) were investigated elaborately. Experimental and calculational analyses showed that, the SEI layer with suppressed growth delivers both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation ability. Thus, the electron leakage is mitigated, which restrains the continuous SEI growth, and favors the interface stability with enhanced electrochemical performance.

     alt="Mitigating Electron Leakage of Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have given insights into the electron leakage behavior that underlies the distinct SEI growth, by investigating the specific SEI component type/distribution in detail. The uniform SEI layer with favorable component and distribution is found to have both low electron driving force and high electron insulation. Therefore, the electron leakage causing SEI growth is largely restrained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interfacial stability is highly responsible for the longevity and safety of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous solid-electrolyte interphase(SEI) growth would deteriorate its stability. Essentially, the SEI growth is associated with the electron leakage behavior, yet few efforts have tried to suppress the SEI growth, from the perspective of mitigating electron leakage. Herein, we built two kinds of SEI layers with distinct growth behaviors, via the additive strategy. The SEI physicochemical features (morphology and componential information) and SEI electronic properties (LUMO level, band gap, electron work function) were investigated elaborately. Experimental and calculational analyses showed that, the SEI layer with suppressed growth delivers both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation ability. Thus, the electron leakage is mitigated, which restrains the continuous SEI growth, and favors the interface stability with enhanced electrochemical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Plasmonic Catalysis: Switching Reaction Pathway from Hydrogenation to Homocoupling Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light irradiation was employed to accelerate and control reaction selectivity by harvesting plasmonic and catalytic effects in AgPd nanoparticles. By focusing on the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, plasmonic effects allowed the control (switch) of the reaction pathway from hydrogenation (leading to ethylbenzene as the product in the dark) to homocoupling (leading to 1,4&#8208;diphenylbutadiyne as the product under visible&#8208;light irradiation).







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis enables the use of light to accelerate molecular transformations. Its application to the control reaction selectivity is highly attractive but remains challenging. Here, we have found that the plasmonic properties in AgPd nanoparticles allowed different reaction pathways for tunable product formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By employing the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene as a model transformation, we demonstrate that visible&#8208;light irradiation can be employed to steer the reaction pathway from hydrogenation to homocoupling. Our data showed that the decrease in the concentration of H species at the surface due to plasmon&#8208;enhanced H2 desorption led to the control in selectivity. These results provide important insights into the understanding of reaction selectivity with light, paving the way for the application of plasmonic catalysis to the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes, and bringing the vision of light&#8208;driven transformations with target selectivity one step closer to reality.

         <title>Persistent ATP&#8208;Concentration Gradients in a Hydrogel Sustained by Chemical Fuel Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled activation of two antagonistic enzymes installs macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentration gradients in a hydrogel. Gradients are maintained as long as chemical fuel is present to drive the reaction network. The ATP&#8208;concentration gradients affect the surface coverage of Au nanoparticles leading to fluorescent patterns that dynamically evolve over time.







Abstract
We show the formation of macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentrations in an agarose gel and demonstrate that these gradients can be sustained in time at the expense of the consumption of a chemical fuel. The approach relies on the spatially controlled activation of ATP&#8208;producing and ATP&#8208;consuming reactions through the local injection of enzymes in the matrix. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is maintained in a stationary non&#8208;equilibrium state as long as chemical fuel, phosphocreatine, is present. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is coupled to a supramolecular system composed of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles and a fluorescent probe. As a result of this coupling, fluorescence signals emerge spontaneously in response to the ATP&#8208;concentration gradients. We show that the approach permits the rational formation of complex fluorescence patterns that change over time as a function of the evolution of the ATP&#8208;concentrations present in the system.

         <title>Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable poly(vinyl ether)s were synthesized with periodically arranged in&#8208;chain thioacetal bonds via cationic degenerative chain&#8208;transfer copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal. The copolymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers via hydrolysis. One&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers is also achieved.







Abstract
We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal (7&#8208;CTA) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of 7&#8208;CTA with vinyl ethers, serve as in&#8208;chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.

         <title>Small Fluorogenic Amino Acids for Peptide&#8208;Guided Background&#8208;Free Imaging</title>

Benzodiazole amino acids are excellent small building blocks for the construction of background&#8208;free peptide probes for fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate their robustness and versatility for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, their minimally invasive character, and their compatibility with different optical imaging modalities, including super&#8208;resolution peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging.







Abstract
The multiple applications of super&#8208;resolution microscopy have prompted the need for minimally invasive labeling strategies for peptide&#8208;guided fluorescence imaging. Many fluorescent reporters display limitations (e.g., large and charged scaffolds, non&#8208;specific binding) as building blocks for the construction of fluorogenic peptides. Herein we have built a library of benzodiazole amino acids and systematically examined them as reporters for background&#8208;free fluorescence microscopy. We have identified amine&#8208;derivatized benzoselenadiazoles as scalable and photostable amino acids for the straightforward solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent peptides. Benzodiazole amino acids retain the binding capabilities of bioactive peptides and display excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. Furthermore, we have demonstrated their application in peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging of postsynaptic density protein&#8208;95 nanoclusters in the synaptosomes from mouse brain tissues.

         <title>Single Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Charged Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with High Volume Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single solution&#8208;phase synthesis method for charged covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) is developed. Charged monomers and appropriate solvent with good solubility and ion dissociation ability are mixed as a high&#8208;concentration stable colloidal solution, in which substantial charged COF&#8208;NSs are formed via charge&#8208;induced in&#8208;plane oriented growth, achieving high volume yield.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) are emerging building blocks for functional materials, and their scalable fabrication is highly desirable. Current synthetic methods suffer from low volume yields resulting from confined on&#8208;surface/at&#8208;interface growth space and complex multiple&#8208;phase synthesis systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of charged COF&#8208;NSs in open space using a single&#8208;phase organic solution system, achieving magnitudes higher volume yields of up to 18.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Charge&#8208;induced electrostatic repulsion forces enable in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from initial discrete and disordered polymers into large and crystalline COF&#8208;NSs.

     alt="Single Solution-Phase Synthesis of Charged Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with High Volume Yield"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single solution-phase synthesis method for charged covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF-NSs) is developed. Charged monomers and appropriate solvent with good solubility and ion dissociation ability are mixed as a high-concentration stable colloidal solution, in which substantial charged COF-NSs are formed via charge-induced in-plane oriented growth, achieving high volume yield.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF-NSs) are emerging building blocks for functional materials, and their scalable fabrication is highly desirable. Current synthetic methods suffer from low volume yields resulting from confined on-surface/at-interface growth space and complex multiple-phase synthesis systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of charged COF-NSs in open space using a single-phase organic solution system, achieving magnitudes higher volume yields of up to 18.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Charge-induced electrostatic repulsion forces enable in-plane anisotropic secondary growth from initial discrete and disordered polymers into large and crystalline COF-NSs. The charged COF-NS colloidal suspensions are cast into thin and compact proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with lamellar morphology and oriented crystallinity, displaying outstanding proton conductivity, negligible dimensional swelling, and good H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cell performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic C4&#8208;Epimerization of UDP&#8208;Glucuronic Acid: Precisely Steered Rotation of a Transient 4&#8208;Keto Intermediate for an Inverted Reaction without Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic C4&#8208;epimerization of UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid involves precisely steered rotation of a transient 4&#8208;ketohexuronic acid intermediate that is facilitated by chair&#8208;to&#8208;boat distortion of a sugar ring. The enzyme thus retains stereoelectronic control and prevents even trace amounts of decarboxylation occurring. A link between conformational selection and epimerase or decarboxylase activity is suggested.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid (UDP&#8208;GlcA) 4&#8208;epimerase illustrates an important problem regarding enzyme catalysis: balancing conformational flexibility with precise positioning. The enzyme coordinates the C4&#8208;oxidation of the substrate by NAD+ and rotation of a decarboxylation&#8208;prone &#946;&#8208;keto acid intermediate in the active site, enabling stereoinverting reduction of the keto group by NADH. We reveal the elusive rotational landscape of the 4&#8208;keto intermediate. Distortion of the sugar ring into boat conformations induces torsional mobility in the enzyme's binding pocket. The rotational endpoints show that the 4&#8208;keto sugar has an undistorted 4C1 chair conformation. The equatorially placed carboxylate group disfavors decarboxylation of the 4&#8208;keto sugar. Epimerase variants lead to decarboxylation upon removal of the binding interactions with the carboxylate group in the opposite rotational isomer of the substrate. Substitutions R185A/D convert the epimerase into UDP&#8208;xylose synthases that decarboxylate UDP&#8208;GlcA in stereospecific, configuration&#8208;retaining reactions.

         <title>Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed plastics were collected from Catalina Harbor on Catalina Island, CA. After sorting, polyethylenes were catalytically degraded into carboxylic diacids. These diacids are then upgraded by engineered strains of Aspergillus nidulans into structurally diverse secondary metabolites. Phase contrast micrographs show ample asperbenzaldehyde crystals in liquid culture medium containing polyethylene digest.







Abstract
Waste plastics represent major environmental and economic burdens due to their ubiquity, slow breakdown rates, and inadequacy of current recycling routes. Polyethylenes are particularly problematic, because they lack robust recycling approaches despite being the most abundant plastics in use today. We report a novel chemical and biological approach for the rapid conversion of polyethylenes into structurally complex and pharmacologically active compounds. We present conditions for aerobic, catalytic digestion of polyethylenes collected from post&#8208;consumer and oceanic waste streams, creating carboxylic diacids that can then be used as a carbon source by the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. As a proof of principle, we have engineered strains of A. nidulans to synthesize the fungal secondary metabolites asperbenzaldehyde, citreoviridin, and mutilin when grown on these digestion products. This hybrid approach considerably expands the range of products to which polyethylenes can be upcycled.

         <title>Unravelling the Complex LiOH&#8208;Based Cathode Chemistry in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex LiOH chemistry is studied using experimental methods combined with ab initio calculations. During discharge, LiOH formation proceeds via 4&#8201;e&#8722; O2 reduction. During charge, LiOH oxidation proceeds via 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation to form OH*, followed by water oxidation and proton formation that leads to high&#8208;potential discharge plateau at subsequent cycles.







Abstract
The LiOH&#8208;based cathode chemistry has demonstrated potential for high&#8208;energy Li&#8722;O2 batteries. However, the understanding of such complex chemistry remains incomplete. Herein, we use the combined experimental methods with ab initio calculations to study LiOH chemistry. We provide a unified reaction mechanism for LiOH formation during discharge via net 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, in which Li2O2 acts as intermediate in low water&#8208;content electrolyte but LiHO2 as intermediate in high water&#8208;content electrolyte. Besides, LiOH decomposes via 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation during charge, generating surface&#8208;reactive hydroxyl species that degrade organic electrolytes and generate protons. These protons lead to early removal of LiOH, followed by a new high&#8208;potential charge plateau (1&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation). At following cycles, these accumulated protons lead to a new high&#8208;potential discharge plateau, corresponding to water formation. Our findings shed light on understanding of 4&#8201;e&#8722; cathode chemistries in metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Engineering Hierarchical Recognition&#8208;Mediated Senolytics for Reliable Regulation of Cellular Senescence and Anti&#8208;Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;senolytic molecular prodrug is developed for reliable regulation of vascular senescence through hierarchical recognition of three types of senescence&#8208;related hallmarks. It can actively target and trigger cell&#8208;specific apoptosis in senescent endothelial cells caused by various stimuli, while keeping silent in non&#8208;senescent cells, contributing to effective inhibition effects on the senescence burden&#8208;induced progress of atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Precise regulation of vascular senescence represents a far&#8208;reaching strategy to combat age&#8208;related diseases. However, the high heterogeneity of senescence, alongside the lack of targeting and potent senolytics, makes it very challenging. Here we report a molecular design to tackle this challenge through multidimensional, hierarchical recognition of three hallmarks commonly shared among senescence, namely, aptamer&#8208;mediated recognition of a membrane marker for active cell targeting, a self&#8208;immolative linker responsive to lysosomal enzymes for switchable drug release, and a compound against antiapoptotic signaling for clearance. Such senolytic can target and trigger severe cell apoptosis in broad&#8208;spectrum senescent endothelial cells, and importantly, distinguish them from the quiescent state. Its potential for in vivo treatment of vascular diseases is successfully illustrated in a model of atherosclerosis, with effective suppression of the plaque progression yet negligible side effects.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane with an Ordered Ion&#8208;Conducting Channel via the McMurray Coupling Reaction</title>

McMurry coupling was used to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes (AEMs). The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels, leading to a high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system trigger in situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability.







Abstract
The McMurry coupling is a facile, gentle and low&#8208;cost chemical reaction for synthesizing. Here, for the first time, we employed the McMurry coupling reaction to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes (AEMs). The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels. The resulting structure was characterized through UV/VIS spectrum, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, leading to high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system also trigger in situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability. Benefiting from this advantage, the as&#8208;obtained Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 AEM exhibits superior alkaline stability (95&#8201;% conductivity retention after 3000&#8197;hrs in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and high mechanical strength of 34.8&#8197;MPa. Moreover, the fuel cell using Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 shows a maximum peak power density of 1.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Co&#8208;La&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Binary Organic Solar Cells with 18.82&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed Co&#8208;La&#8208;based hole transporting layers were developed for organic solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (18.82&#8201;%), superior reproductivity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used hole transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), but its acidity severely reduces the stability of devices. Until now, very few HTLs were developed to replace PEDOT:PSS toward stable and high&#8208;performance OSCs. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;lanthanum (Co&#8208;La) inorganic system was reported as HTL to show a high conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.82&#8201;%, which is among the top PCEs in binary OSCs. Since electron&#8208;rich outer shell of La atom can interact with Co atom to form charge transfer complex, the work function and conductivity of the Co&#8208;La system could be simultaneously enhanced compared to Co or La&#8208;based HTLs. This Co&#8208;La system could also be applied into other OSCs to show high performance. All these results demonstrate that binary Co&#8208;La systems as HTL can efficiently tackle the issue in hole transporting and show powerful application in OSCs to replace PEDOT:PSS.

         <title>Selective Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Catalyzed Depolymerization of Nylon&#8208;6 to &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercial and post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 are selectively recycled to the &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam monomer in high yields by readily accessible lanthanide tris(amide) catalysts in a solvent&#8208;free process. Catalytic activity scales with the lanthanide ionic radius. A chain&#8208;end backbiting mechanism is proposed from experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
Nylon&#8208;6 is selectively depolymerized to the parent monomer &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam by the readily accessible and commercially available lanthanide trisamido catalysts Ln(N(TMS)2)3 (Ln=lanthanide). The depolymerization process is solvent&#8208;free, near quantitative, highly selective, and operates at the lowest Nylon&#8208;6 to &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam depolymerization temperature reported to date. The catalytic activity of the different lanthanide trisamides scales with the Ln3+ ionic radius, and this process is effective with post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 as well as with Nylon&#8208;6+polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate mixtures. Experimental kinetic data and theoretical (DFT) mechanistic analyses suggest initial deprotonation of a Nylon terminal amido N&#8722;H bond, which covalently binds the catalyst to the polymer, followed by a chain&#8208;end back&#8208;biting process in which &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam units are sequentially extruded from the chain end.

         <title>Isolated Electron&#8208;Rich Ruthenium Atoms in Intermetallic Compounds for Boosting Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) are prepared via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. Electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms are the active sites and are isolated in bcc RuGa IMCs, which promote electron transfer from the electrocatalyst to key intermediates, thereby effectively improving the electrocatalytic performance of the nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR).







Abstract
The direct electrochemical nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is an attractive technique for converting NO into NH3 with low power consumption under ambient conditions. Optimizing the electronic structure of the active sites can greatly improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepare body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. The electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable NH4+ yield rate of 320.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Ru with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% at very low potential of &#8722;0.2&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in neutral media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms in bcc RuGa IMCs facilitate the adsorption and activation of *HNO intermediate. Hence, the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in NORR could be greatly reduced.

         <title>Monomer and Excimer Emission in a Conformational and Stacking&#8208;Adaptable Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of molecular conformations, alkyl chain lengths, and charge&#8208;transfer effects has been used to precisely regulate monomer and excimer emission in multiple states. This approach has led to conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules derived from cyanostilbene, diphenyldiacetylene, and alkyl side chains that show applications in temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.







Abstract
A design strategy that combines molecular conformation, alkyl chain length, and charge&#8208;transfer effects has been developed to obtain conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules for precisely regulating the monomer and excimer emission in a single luminous platform under different environments. These fluorophores can exhibit bright monomer emissions when they are in the dispersed state based on their planar conformation. However, when the luminous molecules with short alkyl side chains are in the crystalline state, their molecular conformation can become distorted, further inducing strong intermolecular interactions and staggered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking for bright excimer emission. More importantly, their dispersed and aggregated states can be reversibly regulated in a phase&#8208;change fatty acid matrix, to achieve temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence for temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.

     alt="Monomer and Excimer Emission in a Conformational and Stacking-Adaptable Molecular System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of molecular conformations, alkyl chain lengths, and charge-transfer effects has been used to precisely regulate monomer and excimer emission in multiple states. This approach has led to conformational and stacking-adaptable donor-acceptor-&#960; type molecules derived from cyanostilbene, diphenyldiacetylene, and alkyl side chains that show applications in temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design strategy that combines molecular conformation, alkyl chain length, and charge-transfer effects has been developed to obtain conformational and stacking-adaptable donor-acceptor-&#960; type molecules for precisely regulating the monomer and excimer emission in a single luminous platform under different environments. These fluorophores can exhibit bright monomer emissions when they are in the dispersed state based on their planar conformation. However, when the luminous molecules with short alkyl side chains are in the crystalline state, their molecular conformation can become distorted, further inducing strong intermolecular interactions and staggered &#960;-&#960; stacking for bright excimer emission. More importantly, their dispersed and aggregated states can be reversibly regulated in a phase-change fatty acid matrix, to achieve temperature-responsive fluorescence for temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Nickel Anchored on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon/TiO2 Composite for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CH4 Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2 photocatalyst was designed for direct CH4 oxidation with O2 to oxygenates. Single&#8208;atom Ni&#8722;NC sites not only promote the carrier separation to facilitate CH4 conversion, but also enhance the activation of O2 to &#8901;OOH radicals, thereby leading to a substantial enhancement in activity and selectivity to oxygenates.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenated products is a sustainable strategy for methane valorization at room temperature. However, in this reaction, noble metals are generally needed to function as cocatalysts for obtaining adequate activity and selectivity. Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/TiO2 composite (Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2) as a highly active and selective catalyst for photooxidation of CH4 to C1 oxygenates with O2 as the only oxidant. Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2 exhibits a yield of C1 oxygenates of 198&#8197;&#956;mol for 4&#8197;h with a selectivity of 93&#8201;%, exceeding that of most reported high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the single&#8208;atom Ni&#8722;NC sites not only enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to isolated Ni atoms but also dominantly facilitate the activation of O2 to form the key intermediate &#8901;OOH radicals, which synergistically lead to a substantial enhancement in both activity and selectivity.

         <title>Energy Transport in Dichroic Metallo&#8208;organic Crystals: Selective Inclusion of Spatially Resolved Arrays of Donor and Acceptor Dyes in Different Nanochannels
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between arrays of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores in a metal&#8211;organic framework has been observed. These arrays of aligned chromophores have been formed by size&#8208;selective inclusion in differently nanosized channels, resulting in micro&#8208;sized crystals with anisotropic optical properties.







Abstract
In this study, the precise positioning and alignment of arrays of two different guest molecules in a crystalline host matrix has been engineered and resulted in new optically active materials. Sub&#8208;nm differences in the diameters of two types of 1D channels are sufficient for size&#8208;selective inclusion of dyes. Energy transport occurs between the arrays of different dyes that are included in parallel&#8208;positioned nanochannels by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The color of individual micro&#8208;sized crystals are dependent on their relative position under polarized light. This angular&#8208;dependent behavior is a result of the geometrically constrained orientation of the dyes by the crystallographic packing of the host matrix and is concentration dependent.

         <title>Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Using Vinyl Ethers as Effective Chain&#8208;Transfer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic polymerization mechanism (relying on a regioselective Fischer to Fischer&#8208;carbene exchange) is used to prepare living and degradable ring opening metathesis polymers in one pot. This method also allowed us to synthesize ROMP&#8208;ROMP, ROMP&#8208;ATRP, PEG&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow dispersities using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium catalyst quite straightforwardly.







Abstract
A catalytic living ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) method is described that relies on a degenerative, reversible and regioselective exchange of propagating Fischer&#8208;carbenes. All characteristics of a living polymerization such as narrow dispersity, excellent molar mass control and the ability to form block copolymers are achieved by this method. The method allows the use of up to 200&#8197;times less ruthenium complex than traditional living ROMP. We demonstrate the synthesis of ROMP&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers, ATRP from a ROMP macro&#8208;initiator and living ROMP from a PEG&#8208;based macro chain transfer agent. The cost&#8208;effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis of degradable polymers and block copolymers enabled by this strategy will find various applications in biomedicine, materials science, and technology.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Allylation of Alkanes: Facile Access to Allylic Quaternary sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion of unactivated alkanes with non&#8208;acceptor vinylcarbenes was achieved by silver catalysis and with bench&#8208;stable vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as substrates. The corresponding products feature allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers and were obtained in high yields.







Abstract
The construction of allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers has long been a formidable challenge in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;allyl coupling reactions due to the severe steric hindrance. Herein, we report an effective carbene strategy that employs well&#8208;defined vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as a versatile allylating reagent to enable direct assembly of these medicinally desirable structural elements from low&#8208;cost alkane feedstocks. The reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity for tertiary C&#8722;H bonds, broad scope (&gt;60&#8197;examples and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1:0 r.&#8201;r.) and good efficiency, even on a gram&#8208;scale, making it a convenient alternative to the well&#8208;known Trost&#8211;Tsuji allylation reaction for the formation of alkyl&#8211;allyl bonds. Combined experimental and computational studies were employed to unravel the mechanism and origin of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented Ultrathin Surface: Combining the Merits of Single Crystals and Nanoparticles to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented ultrathin surface with up to 6.9&#8201;% compressive strain combines the high specific activity of single crystals and high electrochemically active surface area of nanoparticles, achieving order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in specific and mass activities toward oxygen reduction reaction compared with benchmark Pt/C.







Abstract
Single crystal surfaces with highly coordinated sites very often hold high specific activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and others. Transposing their high specific activity to practical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area electrocatalysts remains challenging. Here, ultrathin Pt(100) alloy surface is constructed via epitaxial growth. The surface shows 3.1&#8211;6.9&#8201;% compressive strain and bulk&#8208;like characteristics as demonstrated by site&#8208;probe reactions and different spectroscopies. Its ORR activity exceeds that of bulk Pt3Ni(100) and Pt(111) and presents a 19&#8208;fold increase in specific activity and a 13&#8208;fold increase in mass activity relative to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is increased by 4&#8208;fold compared to traditional thin films (e.g. NSTF), which makes the catalyst more tolerant to voltage loss at high current densities under fuel cell operation. This work broadens the family of extended surface catalysts and highlights the knowledge&#8208;driven approach in the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Automated and Efficient Generation of General Molecular Aggregate Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A completely automated, efficient, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool for generating accurate dimers up to large aggregate structures is presented. This algorithm, termed aISS, can be applied to molecules of any size and across the periodic table, which allows combined with its high efficiency the accurate modeling of systems not possible before.







Abstract
Modeling intermolecular interactions of complex non&#8208;covalent structures is important in many areas of chemistry. To facilitate the generation of reasonable dimer, oligomer, and general aggregate geometries, we introduce an automated computational interaction site screening (aISS) workflow. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool combines a genetic algorithm employing the intermolecular force&#8208;field xTB&#8208;IFF for initial search steps with the general force&#8208;field GFN&#8208;FF and the semi&#8208;empirical GFN2&#8208;xTB method for geometry optimizations. Compared with the alternative CREST program, aISS yields similar results but with computer time savings of 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude. This allows for the treatment of systems with thousands of atoms composed of elements up to radon, e.g., metal&#8208;organic complexes, or even polyhedra and zeolite cut&#8208;outs which were not accessible before. Moreover, aISS can identify reactive sites and provides options like site&#8208;directed (user&#8208;guided) screening.

         <title>Up/Down Tuning of Poly(ionic liquid)s in Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel responsive aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) comprising Azo&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified poly(ionic liquid)s were fabricated, whose upper and lower phases could be adjusted using the grafting degree of the Azo and Bn groups. Thermally induced up/down tuning of poly(ionic liquid)s in ATPSs was achieved for the first time in this study.







Abstract
Thermally induced reversible up/down migration of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) was achieved for the first time in this study. Novel ATPSs were fabricated using azobenzene (Azo)&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified PILs, and their upper and lower phases could be easily tuned using the grafting degree (GD) of the Azo and Bn groups. Bn&#8208;PIL with higher GDBn could go up into the upper phase and Azo&#8208;PIL come down to the lower phase when the temperature increased (&gt;65&#8201;&#176;C); this behavior was reversed at lower temperatures. Moreover, a reversible two&#8208;phase/single&#8208;phase transition was realized under UV irradiation. Experimental and simulation results revealed that the difference in the hydration capacity between Bn&#8208;PIL and Azo&#8208;PIL accounted for their unique phase&#8208;separation behavior. A versatile platform for fabricating ATPSs with tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior can be realized based on our findings, which can broaden their applications in the fields of smart separation systems and functional material development.

         <title>Monolithic Phosphate Interphase for Highly Reversible and Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic solid electrolyte interphase was constructed to boost the long&#8208;term cycling of zinc metal anode via a hybrid non&#8208;aqueous/aqueous electrolyte strategy. The interphase exhibits a simple composition (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6) and a highly robust structure, which could help alleviate zinc corrosion and reduce zinc dendrites formation.







Abstract
Zinc metal battery (ZMB) is promising as the next generation of energy storage system, but challenges relating to dendrites and corrosion of the zinc anode are restricting its practical application. Here, to stabilize Zn anode, we report a controlled electrolytic method for a monolithic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via a high dipole moment solvent dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The DMMP&#8208;based electrolytes can generate a homogeneous and robust phosphate SEI (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6). Benefiting from the protecting impact of this in situ monolithic SEI, the zinc electrode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling of 4700&#8197;h and a high Coulombic efficiency 99.89&#8201;% in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cell, respectively. The full V2O5|Zn battery with DMMP&#8208;H2O hybrid electrolyte exhibits a high capacity retention of 82.2&#8201;% following 4000 cycles under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The first success in constructing the monolithic phosphate SEI will open a new avenue in electrolyte design for highly reversible and stable Zn metal anodes.

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) featuring an sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon matrix is found to show ultrahigh proton conductivity. The unique carbon hybridization enables the significant water uptake of GDYO. The giant water uptake of GDYO is beneficial for the formation of multiple proton conduction pathways and the dissociation of huge numbers of protons, thus leading to ultrahigh proton conductivity.







Abstract
Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (100&#8201;% RH, 348&#8197;K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit voltage, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroxylation of C&#8722;H bonds by Synergistic Use of Protein Engineering and Exogenous Dual&#8208;Functional Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic approach is reported for multiple&#8208;site highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by a combination of P450 variants and exogenous dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs). Crystallographic analysis and molecular dynamic simulations provided strong evidence for the synergistic effects of engineered P450s and DFSMs, thus establishing a new synthetic toolbox for sustainable divergent biohydroxylation of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to optionally access diverse hydroxylation products from a given substrate bearing multiple reaction sites of sp3 and sp2 C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we report the highly selective divergent hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by an engineered P450 peroxygenase driven by a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Using combinations of various P450BM3 variants with DFSMs enabled access to more than half of all possible hydroxylated products from each substrate with excellent regioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%), enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee), and high total turnover numbers (up to 80963). Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and theoretical calculations revealed that synergistic effects between exogenous DFSMs and the protein environment controlled regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work has implications for exogenous&#8208;molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroxylation with potential applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Plasmonic Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond of the Benzylic C&#945; atom for Cleavage of Alkyl Aryl Ether Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field and hot electrons of illuminated plasmonic metal nanoparticles enable hydrogen abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of the C&#945; atom of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages. The cleavage of unreactive ether C&#946;&#8722;O bonds is facilitated to produce aromatic compounds with unsaturated double bonds.







Abstract
Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is an important process in organic synthesis, where efficiently activating a specific C(sp3)&#8722;H bond without causing side reactions remains one of chemistry's great challenges. Here we report that illuminated plasmonic silver metal nanoparticles (NPs) can abstract hydrogen from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of the C&#945; atom of an alkyl aryl ether &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage. The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field generated at the illuminated plasmonic NPs promotes chemisorption of the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 compound and the transfer of photo&#8208;generated hot electrons from the NPs to the adsorbed molecules leads to hydrogen abstraction and direct cleavage of the unreactive ether C&#946;&#8722;O bond under moderate reaction conditions (&#8776;90&#8201;&#176;C). The plasmon&#8208;driven process has certain exceptional features: enabling hydrogen abstraction from a specific C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, along with precise scission of the targeted C&#8722;O bond to form aromatic compounds containing unsaturated, substituted groups in excellent yields.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphile Mediated Co&#8208;assembly for Nanoplasmonic Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric probe for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease is reported by modulating the interplay of peptide amphiphiles and gold nanoparticles via aromatic interactions. This probe showed good performance in exhaled breath and saliva, demonstrating a favorable strategy for designing amphiphilic peptides for plasmonic coupling in complex media.







Abstract
Aromatic interactions are commonly involved in the assembly of naturally occurring building blocks, and these interactions can be replicated in an artificial setting to produce functional materials. Here we describe a colorimetric biosensor using co&#8208;assembly experiments with plasmonic gold and surfactant&#8208;like peptides (SLPs) spanning a wide range of aromatic residues, polar stretches, and interfacial affinities. The SLPs programmed in DDD&#8722;(ZZ)x&#8722;FFPC self&#8208;assemble into higher&#8208;order structures in response to a protease and subsequently modulate the colloidal dispersity of gold leading to a colorimetric readout. Results show the strong aggregation propensity of the FFPC tail without polar DDD head. The SLPs were specific to the target protease, i.e., Mpro, a biomarker for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This system is a simple and visual tool that senses Mpro in phosphate buffer, exhaled breath condensate, and saliva with detection limits of 15.7, 20.8, and 26.1&#8197;nM, respectively. These results may have value in designing other protease testing methods.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Transfer Hydroiodination of Terminal Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a shuttle approach for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of terminal alkynes to vinyl iodides. For aliphatic alkynes, a ligand&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent stereodivergence is observable. The vinyl iodides are engaged in a variety of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming reactions. The method is used to shorten a synthetic sequence to a cis&#8208;fatty acid. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and stoichiometric experiments give insights into the mechanism.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes is reported. Depending on the choice of ligand and substrate, either (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;configured alkenyl iodides are obtained in high to exclusive isomeric purity. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance, employing easily accessible or commercially available aliphatic iodides as HI surrogates through a shuttle process. The synthesized vinyl iodides were applied in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with full retention of the stereoselectivity. The developed method could be used to significantly shorten the total synthesis of a marine cis&#8208;fatty acid. Additionally, initial deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and stoichiometric reactions shed some light on the potential reaction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
A novel, two&#8208;step chemical&#8208;biological approach converts post&#8208;consumer polyethylenes into structurally diverse and pharmacologically active fungal natural products, as reported by Travis&#8197;J. Williams, Clay&#8197;C.&#8197;C. Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202214609). Polyethylenes are first cleaved into carboxylic diacids using catalytic oxidation. Genetically engineered strains of fungi then rapidly convert these diacids into natural product pharmaceutical platforms implicated in the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and bacterial infections.

         <dc:description>
The emission color and bandgap of halide perovskites are routinely tuned by halide mixing or quantum confinement. In their Communication (e202215947), Vasudevanpillai Biju and co&#8208;workers demonstrate selective exciton and carrier recombination in donor&#8211;acceptor bandgap engineered halide perovskite single crystals or nanocrystal films to show color tuning at desired locations. By real&#8208;time stitching of a narrow bandgap iodide domain in a wide bandgap microrod, microplate or nanocrystal sample, excitons and carriers are quantitatively transferred from the green&#8208;emitting bromide regions to the red&#8208;emitting iodide domain.

The circular ssDNA genome originating from the bacterial phage phiX174 is efficiently packaged into an icosahedral DNA nanoframe to form a virus mimetic particle, which can passively infect the host E.&#8197;coli bacteria through cell uptake. The structural rigidity, integrity, permeability, and programmability of the nanoframe are key features in the genome packaging and E.&#8197;coli infection process, as reported by Yang Yang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214731).

         <title>Electrosynthetic C&#8722;O Bond Activation in Alcohols and Alcohol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deoxygenative transformations of alcohols and their derivatives are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. This Review includes preparative protocols and their mechanistic aspects for the activation and functionalization of C&#8722;O bonds, detailing direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.







Abstract
Alcohols and their derivatives are ubiquitous and versatile motifs in organic synthesis. Deoxygenative transformations of these compounds are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. However, electrochemically driven redox events have been shown to facilitate the C&#8722;O bond cleavage in alcohols and their derivatives either through direct electron transfer or through the use of electron transfer mediators and electroactive catalysts. Herein, a comprehensive overview of preparative electrochemically mediated protocols for C&#8722;O bond activation and functionalization is detailed, including direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.

         <title>Formal Cycloadditions Driven by the Homolytic Opening of Strained, Saturated Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring strain provides a driving force for the formation of reactive intermediates. Bonds of strained rings may undergo homolysis upon thermolysis, photolysis, radical addition, or following single electron transfer events. Regardless of homolytic method, intermediates competent in formal cycloaddition can be formed. Herein, we describe formal cycloadditions of strained systems operating via radical pathways.







Abstract
The field of strain&#8208;driven, radical formal cycloadditions is experiencing a surge in activity motivated by a renaissance in free radical chemistry and growing demand for sp3&#8208;rich ring systems. The former has been driven in large part by the rise of photoredox catalysis, and the latter by adoption of the &#8220;Escape from Flatland&#8221; concept in medicinal chemistry. In the years since these broader trends emerged, dozens of formal cycloadditions, including catalytic, asymmetric variants, have been developed that operate via radical mechanisms. While cyclopropanes have been studied most extensively, a variety of strained ring systems are amenable to the design of analogous reactions. Many of these processes generate lucrative, functionally decorated sp3&#8208;rich ring systems that are difficult to access by other means. Herein, we summarize recent efforts in this area and analyze the state of the field.

         <title>Engineering Heterogeneous Catalysis with Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions: Characterization, Theory and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) are a key concept in heterogeneous catalysis, which governs catalytic performance in various processes. The application of modern characterization and modeling approaches is revolutionary in the study of SMSI phenomena. This Minireview focuses on recent progress in understanding and utilizing SMSI and provides an outlook for the future development in this multidisciplinary field.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) represent a classic yet fast&#8208;growing area in catalysis research. The SMSI phenomenon results in the encapsulation and stabilization of metal nanoparticles (NPs) with the support material that significantly impacts the catalytic performance through regulation of the interfacial interactions. Engineering SMSI provides a promising approach to steer catalytic performance in various chemical processes, which serves as an effective tool to tackle energy and environmental challenges. Our Minireview covers characterization, theory, catalytic activity, dependence on the catalytic structure and inducing environment of SMSI phenomena. By providing an overview and outlook on the cutting&#8208;edge techniques in this multidisciplinary research field, we not only want to provide insights into the further exploitation of SMSI in catalysis, but we also hope to inspire rational designs and characterization in the broad field of material science and physical chemistry.

         <title>Advancing MXene Electrocatalysts for Energy Conversion Reactions: Surface, Stoichiometry, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their remarkable physical properties and diversity of chemical structures, MXenes offer a platform to create highly active and selective electrocatalysts for key energy conversion reactions. This Review discusses the latest literature relevant to their application in electrocatalysis and provides a perspective supplemented by new DFT calculations on how MXenes may play a key role in the global sustainable energy transition.







Abstract
MXenes, due to their tailorable chemistry and favourable physical properties, have great promise in electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions. To exploit fully their enormous potential, further advances specific to electrocatalysis revolving around their performance, stability, compositional discovery and synthesis are required. The most recent advances in these aspects are discussed in detail: surface functional and stoichiometric modifications which can improve performance, Pourbaix stability related to their electrocatalytic operating conditions, density functional theory and advances in machine learning for their discovery, and prospects in large scale synthesis and solution processing techniques to produce membrane electrode assemblies and integrated electrodes. This Review provides a perspective that is complemented by new density functional theory calculations which show how these recent advances in MXene material design are paving the way for effective electrocatalysts required for the transition to integrated renewable energy systems.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective Allylic C&#8722;H Amination with Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed branch&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective allylic C&#8722;H amination from 1,4&#8208;dienes and aromatic amines has been established for the efficient synthesis of thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines also smoothly engage in the allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction without any Lewis acid additive, preferentially giving linear&#8208;selective allylamines as the major regioisomers.







Abstract
Allylamines are important building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive compounds. The direct coupling of allylic C&#8722;H bonds and commonly available amines is a major synthetic challenge. An allylic C&#8722;H amination of 1,4&#8208;dienes has been accomplished by palladium catalysis. With aromatic amines, branch&#8208;selective allylic aminations are favored to generate thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines can also engage in the reaction, but linear dienyl allylic amines are the major products.

         <title>Strong Anchoring of Hydrogels through Superwetting&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Density Interfacial Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to fabricate strongly anchored hydrogel&#8208;solid samples by forming high&#8208;density covalent bonds. By manipulating the initiator wettability, the hydrogels prepared by the SAIP strategy exhibit a high&#8208;strength adhesion of &#8776;1.37&#8197;MPa to resist swelling destruction.







Abstract
Strong adhesion of hydrogels on solids plays an important role in stable working for various practical applications. However, current hydrogel adhesion suffers from poor interfacial bonding with solid surfaces. Here, we propose a general superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to robustly anchor hydrogels onto solids by forming high&#8208;density interfacial covalent bonds. The key of our strategy is to make the initiator fully contact solid surfaces via a superwetting way for enhancing the interfacial grafting efficiency. The designed anchored hydrogels show strong bulk failure with a high breaking strength of &#8776;1.37&#8197;MPa, different from weak interfacial failure that occurs in traditional strategies. The strong interfacial adhesion greatly enhances the stability of hydrogels against swelling destruction. This work opens up new inspirations for designing strongly anchored hydrogels from an interfacial chemistry perspective.

Protoglobins were engineered to catalyze stereodivergent cyclopropanation to afford a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes using trifluorodiazoethane as the trifluoromethyl&#8208;carbene precursor.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (CF3&#8208;CPAs) constitute an important class of compounds for drug discovery. While several methods have been developed for synthesis of trans&#8208;CF3&#8208;CPAs, stereoselective production of corresponding cis&#8208;diastereomers remains a formidable challenge. We report a biocatalyst for diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of cis&#8208;CF3&#8208;CPAs with activity on a variety of alkenes. We found that an engineered protoglobin from Aeropyrnum pernix (ApePgb) can catalyze this unusual reaction at preparative scale with low&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yield (6&#8211;55&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (17&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), depending on the substrate. Computational studies revealed that the steric environment in the active site of the protoglobin forced iron&#8208;carbenoid and substrates to adopt a pro&#8208;cis near&#8208;attack conformation. This work demonstrates the capability of enzyme catalysts to tackle challenging chemistry problems and provides a powerful means to expand the structural diversity of CF3&#8208;CPAs for drug discovery.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Transport in Metal Nanocluster&#8208;Based Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)&#8208;based spin valves are fabricated and a magnetoresistance value of 1.6&#8201;% is achieved even at room temperature. The atomic structure regulated spin transport property of MNCs has been fully explored.







Abstract
As a new type of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid semiconductor, quantum&#8208;confined atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have been widely applied in the fields of chemical sensing, optical imaging, biomedicine and catalysis. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate the first example of MNC&#8208;based spin valves (SVs) that exhibit remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to 1.6&#8201;% even at room temperature (300&#8197;K). The concomitant photoresponse of MNC&#8208;based SVs unambiguously confirms that the spin&#8208;polarized electron transmission takes place across the MNC interlayer. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;dependent transport property of MNC&#8208;based SVs is largely varied by changing the atomic structure of MNCs. Both experimental proofs and quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the atomic structure&#8208;discriminative spin transport behavior is attributed to the distinct spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect of MNCs.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Nanocrystal Films as Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using focused near&#8208;infrared laser trapping, bromide&#8208;iodide perovskite heterojunctions are prepared by local anion exchange reactions in methylammonium lead bromide perovskite microcrystals or nanocrystal thin films. The resulting donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunctions efficiently transport and trap photogenerated carriers. This method offers a route to heterojunction fabrication in single crystals for solar cells and LEDs.







Abstract
Halide perovskites are materials for future optical displays and solar cells. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor perovskite heterostructures with distinguishing halide compositions are promising for transporting and harvesting photogenerated charge carriers. Combined e&#8208;beam lithography and anion exchange are promising to develop such heterostructures but challenging to prepare multiple heterojunctions at desired locations in single crystals. We demonstrate swift laser trapping&#8208;assisted band gap engineering at the desired locations in MAPbBr3 microrods, microplates, or nanocrystal thin films. The built&#8208;in donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunction structures let us transport and trap photogenerated charge carriers from wide&#8208;band gap bromide to narrow&#8208;band gap iodide domains. We discuss the charge carrier transport and trapping mechanisms from the viewpoints of engineered bands and band continuity. This work offers a convenient method for designing single&#8208;, double&#8208; and multi&#8208;heterojunction donor&#8208;acceptor halide perovskites for photovoltaic, photonic, and electronic applications.

         <title>Copper Complexes with Diazoolefin Ligands and their Photochemical Conversion into Alkenylidene Complexes</title>

A copper(I) complex with a diazoolefin ligand was converted into an alkenylidene complex by in crystallo photolysis.







Abstract
Homometallic copper complexes with alkenylidene ligands are discussed as intermediates in catalysis but the isolation of such complexes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the structural characterization of copper complexes with bridging and terminal alkenylidene ligands. The compounds were obtained by irradiation of CuI complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin ligands. The complex with a terminal alkenylidene ligand required isolation in a crystalline matrix, and its structural characterization was enabled by in crystallo photolysis at low temperature.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive silylarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using chlorosilanes and aryl bromides is reported. The reaction affords 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is distinct from those obtained with conventional hydro&#8208; and carbosilylation methods. This work shows the possibility to achieve the silyl&#8208;functionalization of unsaturated bonds using readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Catalytic, three&#8208;component, cross&#8208;electrophile reactions have recently emerged as a promising tool for molecular diversification, but studies have focused mainly on the alkyl&#8208;carbonations of alkenes. Herein, the scope of this method has been extended to conjugated dienes and silicon chemistry through silylative difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with chlorosilanes and aryl bromides. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions to afford 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is different to those obtained from conventional methods via an intermediary of H(C)&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allylmetal species. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that chlorosilane reacts with 1,3&#8208;diene first and then couples with aryl bromide.

Directed transformations of amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) structures lead to the self&#8208;assembled synthesis of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;scale fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up preparation of two&#8208;dimensional material micro&#8208;nano structures at scale facilitates the realisation of integrated applications in optoelectronic devices. Fibrous Phosphorus (FP), an allotrope of black phosphorus (BP), is one of the most promising candidate materials in the field of optoelectronics with its unique crystal structure and properties.[1] However, to date, there are no bottom&#8208;up micro&#8208;nano structure preparation methods for crystalline phosphorus allotropes.[1c,&#8201;2] Herein, we present the bottom&#8208;up preparation of fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays via a low&#8208;pressure gas&#8208;phase transport (LP&#8208;CVT) method that controls the directional phase transition from amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) to FP. In addition, self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PD) of FP&#8208;MP arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects achieved detection beyond the band gap limit. Our results provide a new approach for bottom&#8208;up preparation of other crystalline allotropes of phosphorus.

         <title>An Isolable Bis(Germylene)&#8208;Stabilized Plumbylone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable plumbylone was synthesized and characterized, which possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb0 center. In accord with its electron&#8208;rich nature, the plumbylone exhibits intriguing reactivity involving transfer of Pb0 atom to an organic azide to form a tetrameric imido complex and undergoing a metathetic reaction with GeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane to afford a germylone.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of a stable plumbylone (3) by reduction of a bromodigermylplumbylene (2) with 2.2&#8197;equiv of potassium graphite (KC8). The molecular structure of 3 was established by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and features a two&#8208;coordinated Pb center with an acute Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge bond angle. Computational studies showed that this complex (3) possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb0 center. Its high thermal stability can be most likely ascribed to the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge moiety. A preliminary reactivity study demonstrates that complex 3 can deliver Pb0 atoms to an organic azide producing a tetrameric imido complex [(PbNDipp)4] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr&#8208;C6H3, 4) and perform a metathesis reaction with GeCl2&#8901;dioxane to produce a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized germylone (5), highlighting the synthetic utility of 3.

         <title>Designing Thiophene&#8208;Enriched Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework as Metal&#8208;Free Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was designed and synthesized. Attributed to its conjugated and thiophene&#8208;enriched skeletons, the material exhibited intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen&#8208;reduction catalytic activity. It was for the first time integrated into the hydrogen fuel cells as cathode catalyst, and the devices displayed a peak power density up to 493&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The application of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in renewable energy fields is greatly limited due to their non&#8208;conjugated skeletons. Here, we design and successfully synthesize a thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11) through an all&#8208;thiophene&#8208;linked saddle&#8208;shaped building block (COThTh&#8208;CHO). The BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11 exhibits excellent semiconducting property with intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Using the COF as cathode catalyst, the assembled anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) exhibited a high peak power density up to 493&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. DFT calculations reveal that thiophene introduction in the COF not only improves the conductivity but also optimizes the electronic structure of the sample, which therefore boosts the ORR performance. This is the first report on the application of COFs as metal&#8208;free catalysts in fuel cells, demonstrating the great potential of fully conjugated 3D COFs as promising semiconductors in energy fields.

         <title>Access to Disentangled Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene via a Binuclear Synergic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient synthetic method is reported to tie together two half&#8208;sandwich scandium dialkyls with short linkers. The binuclear complex C1&#8208;Sc2 exhibits extremely high activity for ethylene polymerization and affords ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) featuring low entanglement degree and excellent processing capability under a wide range of reaction temperatures (25&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) and ethylene pressures (2&#8211;13&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Disentangled ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (dis&#8208;UHMWPE) has excellent processability but can be achieved under extreme conditions. Herein, we report ethylene polymerization with the binuclear half&#8208;sandwich scandium complexes C1&#8208;Sc2 and C2&#8208;Sc2 to afford UHMWPE. C1&#8208;Sc2 bearing a short linker shows higher activity and gives higher molecular weight PEs than C2&#8208;Sc2 containing a flexible spacer and the mononuclear Sc1. Strikingly, all UHMWPEs isolated from C1&#8208;Sc2 under broad temperature range (25&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) and wide ethylene pressures (2&#8211;13&#8197;bar) feature very low degree of entanglement as proved by rheological test, DSC annealing study and SEM. These dis&#8208;UHMWPEs are facilely mediated solid&#8208;state&#8208;process at 130&#8201;&#176;C and their tensile strength and modulus reach up to 149.2&#8197;MPa and 1.5&#8197;GPa, respectively. DFT simulations reveal that the formation of dis&#8208;UHMWPE is attributed to the binuclear synergic effect and the agostic interaction between the active center and the growing chain.

         <title>Helical Bilayer Nonbenzenoid Nanographene Bearing a [10]Helicene with Two Embedded Heptagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene has been synthesized with a novel [10]helicene backbone bearing two heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197;, in which the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation between the two layers is determined. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of this helical nanographene have also been evaluated.







Abstract
The precision synthesis of helical bilayer nanographenes (NGs) with new topology is of substantial interest because of their exotic physicochemical properties. However, helical bilayer NGs bearing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain synthetically challenging. Here we present the efficient synthesis of the first helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene (HBNG1) from a tailor&#8208;made azulene&#8208;embedded precursor, which contains a novel [10]helicene backbone with two embedded heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveals its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a record small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197; among the reported helical bilayer NGs. Notably, the close interlayer distance between the two layers offers intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation as revealed by in situ spectroelectrochemistry studies together with DFT simulations. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of HBNG1 are also evaluated by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

     alt="Helical Bilayer Nonbenzenoid Nanographene Bearing a [10]Helicene with Two Embedded Heptagons"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene has been synthesized with a novel [10]helicene backbone bearing two heptagons. Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197;, in which the intramolecular through-space conjugation between the two layers is determined. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; enantiomers of this helical nanographene have also been evaluated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precision synthesis of helical bilayer nanographenes (NGs) with new topology is of substantial interest because of their exotic physicochemical properties. However, helical bilayer NGs bearing non-hexagonal rings remain synthetically challenging. Here we present the efficient synthesis of the first helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene (&lt;b&gt;HBNG1&lt;/b&gt;) from a tailor-made azulene-embedded precursor, which contains a novel [10]helicene backbone with two embedded heptagons. Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a record small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197; among the reported helical bilayer NGs. Notably, the close interlayer distance between the two layers offers intramolecular through-space conjugation as revealed by in situ spectroelectrochemistry studies together with DFT simulations. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of &lt;b&gt;HBNG1&lt;/b&gt; are also evaluated by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Annealing in Adaptive Multicomponent Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annealing changes the assembly of fibres and leads to self&#8208;sorting in the case of multicomponent systems. When a multilayer gel is formed, annealing can be used to form hybrid materials.







Abstract
We use a pH&#8208;driven annealing process to convert between co&#8208;assembled and self&#8208;sorted networks in multicomponent gels. The initially formed gels at low pH are co&#8208;assembled, with the two components coexisting within the same self&#8208;assembled structures. We use an enzymatic approach to increase the pH, resulting in a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition, followed by a hydrolysis to lower the pH once again. As the pH decreases, a self&#8208;sorted network is formed by a two&#8208;stage gelation process determined by the pKa of each component. This approach can be expanded to layered systems to generate many varied systems by changing composition and rates of pH change, adapting their microstructure and so allowing access to a far greater range of morphologies and complexity than can be achieved in single component systems.

         <title>Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO and Methanol over a Silicon Photocathode Functionalized with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Molecular Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrode assembly based on planar p&#8208;type silicon and a cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst is developed for photoelectrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and methanol under solar irradiation and in aqueous media.







Abstract
We report a precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free molecular catalyst&#8208;based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide which is integrated via a (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p&#8208;type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Methanol production is observed at an onset potential of &#8722;0.36&#8197;V vs RHE, and reaches a peak turnover frequency of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1. To date, this is the only molecular catalyst&#8208;based photoelectrode that is active for the six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to methanol. This work puts forth a strategy for interfacing molecular catalysts to p&#8208;type semiconductors and demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and methanol.

         <title>Cycling a Tether into Multiple Rings: Pt&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles for Differentiated Guest Recognition, Pseudorotaxane Transformations, and Guest Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrapping a tether around a platinum ion gives five different pseudocrown ethers that differ in shape and host activity. The Pt ion in the rings is redox&#8208;active and stays that way even if the host is occupied by a guest, facilitating expeditious pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane transformations, guest&#8208;directed ring reactivity, and release of guests upon redox stimulation.







Abstract
Macrocycle engineering is a key topic in supramolecular chemistry. When synthesizing a ring, one can obtain either complex mixtures of macrocycles of different sizes or a single ring if a template is utilized. Here, we unite these approaches along with post&#8208;synthetic modifications to transform a single tether into multiple rings&#8212;up to five per tether. The macrocycles contain two bridged phenylpyridine ligands that are connected through a Pt atom, which defines the rings&#8217; shape, size, and host activity. All rings undergo redox reactions (between PtII and PtIV) that allow for large conformational changes. Their reactivity, together with their host performance, is a convenient way to control the capture and release of guests, to mediate ring transformations, and to control pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane conversions. This novel approach could serve to assemble other libraries of small ring molecules, create cyclic polymers bridged by responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal nodes, and produce processable mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>A Synthesis of Alstonlarsine A via Alstolucines&#8197;B and F Demonstrates the Chemical Feasibility of a Proposed Biogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alstonlarsine&#8197;A, an indole monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Alstonia plants, was prepared by a rearrangement of other Alstonia alkaloids, alstolucines&#8197;B and F. The successful process was patterned after a revised biogenetic proposal that features the first example of the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221; in alkaloid biogenesis.







Abstract
We offer a new biogenetic proposal for the origin of the complex alkaloid alstonlarsine&#8197;A, through rearrangement of the Strychnos alkaloids alstolucines&#8197;B and F. Further, we provide evidence of the chemical feasibility of this proposal in the facile conversion of synthetic alstolucines into alstonlarsine&#8197;A through a short, efficient sequence of N&#8208;methylation, &#946;&#8208;elimination, and a cascade 1,7&#8208;hydride shift/Mannich cyclization. We believe that this is the first biogenetic proposal involving the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221;, a hydride&#8208;shift&#8208;based internal redox trigger of a Mannich cyclization. A further interesting feature of the cascade is that its stereochemical outcome most likely originates in conformational preferences during the hydride shift.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Azaarylethynyl Tertiary Alcohols by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Phosphine&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general kinetic resolution of azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols was developed by a novel phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation strategy catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid. Besides enabling the asymmetric construction of azaarene&#8208;functionalized tertiary alcohols of biological importance, the method provides a precise synthetic path to generate enantioenriched azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes and deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation protocol is reported. This metal&#8208;free method provides a precise kinetic resolution platform for azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols, which are a broad category of biologically and synthetically important azaarene derivatives. In addition to providing an efficient method for the first asymmetric preparation of these tertiary alcohols, the strategy facilitates the construction of azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The high selectivity factors (s up to 235), broad substrate scope, and ability to convert azaaryl compounds into both chiral tertiary alcohols and allenes robustly underscore the efficiency and promising utility of this method. The practicability is further validated by the successful synthesis of deuterated allenes with high ee values and substantial incorporation of deuterium using inexpensive D2O as the deuterium source.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient and general kinetic resolution of azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols was developed by a novel phosphine-mediated deoxygenation strategy catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid. Besides enabling the asymmetric construction of azaarene-functionalized tertiary alcohols of biological importance, the method provides a precise synthetic path to generate enantioenriched azaaryl-functionalized allenes and deuterated derivatives.

         <title>17O Hyperfine Spectroscopy Reveals Hydration Structure of Nitroxide Radicals in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration structure of two different nitroxide radicals in bulk water is investigated by hyperfine spectroscopy that detects H217O. Combination of ENDOR and HYSCORE methods reveals preferred coordination geometries and H&#8208;bonding. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with DFT calculations provided the link between observed spectroscopic parameters and their distribution.







Abstract
The hydration structure of nitroxide radicals in aqueous solutions is elucidated by advanced 17O hyperfine (hf) spectroscopy with support of quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations. A piperidine and a pyrrolidine&#8208;based nitroxide radical are compared and show clear differences in the preferred directionality of H&#8208;bond formation. We demonstrate that these scenarios are best represented in 17O hf spectra, where in&#8208;plane coordination over 
&#8208;type H&#8208;bonding leads to little spin density transfer on the water oxygen and small hf couplings, whereas 
&#8208;type perpendicular coordination generates much larger hf couplings. Quantitative analysis of the spectra based on MD simulations and DFT predicted hf parameters is consistent with a distribution of close solvating water molecules, in which directionality is influenced by subtle steric effects of the ring and the methyl group substituents.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Chiral Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;based chiral nanographene has been synthesized through helical &#960;&#8208;extension of highly emissive chromophores whilst maintaining the frontier molecular orbital distributions. This nanographene exhibits excellent luminescence properties, with a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among chiral nanographenes and a remarkable CPL brightness of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Chiral nanographenes with both high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) and large dissymmetry factors (glum) are essential to the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, most studies have been focused on the improvement of glum, whereas how to design highly emissive chiral nanographenes is still unclear. In this work, we propose a new design strategy to achieve chiral nanographenes with high &#934;F by helical &#960;&#8208;extension of strongly luminescent chromophores while maintaining the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution pattern. Chiral nanographene with perylene as the core and two dibenzo[6]helicene fragments as the wings has been synthesized, which exhibits a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among the reported chiral nanographenes and excellent CPL brightness (BCPL) of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>A Sterically Tuned Directing Auxiliary Promotes Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Carbofluorination of Alkenyl Carbonyl Compounds

         <dc:description>
Judicious tuning of the steric environment on the bidentate directing auxiliary is proposed to facilitate challenging C(sp3)&#8722;F reductive elimination from a PdIV intermediate in the site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of unactivated alkenyl carbonyl compounds, aryl&#8208; or alkenylboronic acids, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide.







Abstract

Tuning of the steric environment on the bidentate directing auxiliary enhances regioselectivity and facilitates challenging C(sp3)&#8722;F reductive elimination from a PdIV intermediate to afford 1,2&#8208;carbofluorination products in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Color Photoconvertible Fluorescent Probes Based on Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to obtain bright dual&#8208;color photoconvertible fluorophores is presented based on a new mechanism called Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion (DPIC). The mechanism is based on the directed oxidation of the pyrrole that is conjugated to the fluorophore. This approach led to SC&#8208;P, which stains the lipid droplets in live cells and that undergoes a hypsochromic shift of 68&#8197;nm upon visible light irradiation.







Abstract
We herein present a new concept to produce dual&#8208;color photoconvertible probes based on a mechanism called Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion (DPIC). As a support of this mechanism, styryl&#8208;coumarins (SCs) bearing Aromatic Singlet Oxygen Reactive Moieties (ASORMs) like furan and pyrrole have been synthesized. SCs are bright fluorophores, which undergo a hypsochromic conversion upon visible light irradiation due to directed photooxidation of the ASORM that leads to the disruption of conjugation. SC&#8208;P, a yellow emitting probe bearing a pyrrole moiety, converts to a stable blue emitting coumarin with a 68&#8197;nm shift allowing the photoconversion and tracking of lipid droplet in live cells. This new approach might pave the way to a new generation of photoconvertible dyes for advanced bioimaging applications.

A nitro&#8208;nitride &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr featuring broad visible&#8208;light absorption, high thermal stability, and low defect concentration is revealed as a multifunctional photocatalyst for effective water reduction, water oxidation and CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Developing mixed&#8208;anion semiconductors for solar fuel production has inspired extensive interest, but the nitrohalide&#8208;based photocatalyst is still in shortage. Here we report a layered nitro&#8208;halide &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr with a narrow band gap of ca. 2.3&#8197;eV and low defect density to exhibit multifunctionalities for photocatalytic water reduction, water oxidation and CO2 reduction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As confirmed by the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the formation of anion vacancies in the nitro&#8208;halide photocatalyst was inhibited due to its relatively high formation energy. Furthermore, performance of &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr can be effectively promoted by a simple exfoliation into nanosheets to shorten the carrier transfer distance as well as to promote charge separation. Our work extends the territory of functional photocatalysts into the nitro&#8208;halide, which opens a new avenue for fabricating efficient artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline Diamide &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system is developed, where site selective bromination, cyanation, and thionation can be accessed. Optoelectronic properties are effectively fine&#8208;tuned via chemical modifications for different electronic functions. The dicyanated BQQDA with a deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level exhibits air&#8208;stable electron mobility of 0.96&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;electron systems are urgently needed for organic electronics, yet their design and synthesis are challenging due to the low reactivity from large electron affinities. In this work, we report a benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system. The electron&#8208;rich condensed amide as opposed to the generally&#8208;employed imide provides a suitable electronic feature for chemical versatility to tailor the BQQDA &#960;&#8208;electron system for various electronic applications. We demonstrate an effective synthetic method to furnish the target BQQDA parent structure, and highly selective functionalization can be performed on bay positions of the &#960;&#8208;skeleton. In addition, thionation of BQQDA can be accomplished under mild conditions. Fine&#8208;tuning of fundamental properties and supramolecular packing motifs are achieved via chemical modifications, and the cyanated BQQDA organic semiconductor demonstrates a high air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence through Cooperative and Energy&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms in Yb3+&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,5&#8208;Benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and Yb3+ ions were assembled into Yb&#8208;BTC metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs) showing upconversion luminescence under near&#8208;infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. In addition, various activators were doped into the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs and their upconversion luminescence and energy&#8208;transfer mechanisms were studied. These MOFs show excellent potential for optical information storage.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) have versatile luminescence properties, however it is challenging to achieve lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence in these materials. Here, 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and trivalent Yb3+ ions were used to generate crystalline Yb&#8208;BTC MOF 1D&#8208;microrods with upconversion luminescence under near infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. Subsequently, the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs were doped with a variety of different lanthanides to evaluate the potential for Yb3+&#8208;based upconversion and energy transfer. Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs doped with Er3+, Ho3+, Tb3+, and Eu3+ ions exhibit both the cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ and the characteristic emission bands of these ions under 980&#8197;nm irradiation. In contrast, only the 497&#8197;nm upconversion emission band from Yb3+ is observed in the MOFs doped with Tm3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, and Dy3+. The effects of different dopants on the efficiency of cooperative luminescence were established and will provide guidance for the exploitation of Ln&#8208;MOFs exhibiting upconversion.

         <title>Highly Effective Hybrid Copper(I) Iodide Cluster Emitter with Negative Thermal Quenched Phosphorescence for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low efficiency triplet emission of hybrid copper(I) iodine clusters is a critical obstacle to their further practical optoelectronic application. Herein, we present an efficient hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster emitter (DBA)4Cu4I4, where the cooperation of excited state structure recombination and the metallophilicity interaction enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 94.9%, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8208;300 K. We also investigate the potential of this emitter for X&#8208;ray imaging. The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of ~5.0 lp mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.</dc:description>

The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of ~5.0 lp mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X-ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Strengthened Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Degradable X&#8208;ray Detector with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility and Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X&#8208;ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8226;H2O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H2O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron&#8208;phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X&#8208;ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and low detection limit (0.14 nGyair s&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Organic Framework Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered bicontinuous&#8208;structured metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using polymer cubosomes (PCs) with a double primitive structure (Im m symmetry) as the template. The filling of MOF precursors in the open channel of PCs, followed by their coordination and removal of the template, generates MOF cubosomes with a single primitive topology (Pm&#8208;3m) and average mesopore diameters of 60&#8211;65 nm. Mechanism study reveals that the formation of ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes undergoes a new MOF growth process, which involves the formation of individual MOF seeds in the template, their growth and eventual fusion into the cubosomes. Their growth kinetics follows the Avrami equation with an Avrami exponent of n = 3 and a growth rate of k = 1.33*10&#8208;4, indicating their fast 3D heterogeneous growth mode. Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Cation Migration and Deposition with Xylitol Additive and Oriented Reconstruction of Hydrogen Bonds for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly reversible plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes is one of the critical processes determining the performance of Zn&#8208;ion batteries, but it is severely impeded by the parasitic side reaction and dendrite growth. Herein, a novel electrolyte engineering strategy is first proposed based on the usage of 100 mM xylitol additive, which inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening electrostatic interaction through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. Concomitantly, xylitol molecules are preferentially adsorbed by Zn surface, which provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress the planar diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ transference number and cycling lifespan of Zn||Zn cells have been significantly elevated, overwhelmingly larger than bare ZnSO4. The cell coupled with a NaV3O8 cathode still behaves much better than the additive&#8208;free device in terms of capacity retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Passivating Lithiated Graphite via Targeted Repair of SEI to Inhibit Exothermic Reactions in Early&#8722;stage of Thermal Runaway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;exothermic in early stage of thermal runaway is blasting&#8208;fuse for Li&#8208;ion battery safety issues. The exothermic reaction between lithiated graphite (LiCx) and electrolyte accounts for onset of this behavior. However, prevent the deleterious reaction still encounters hurdles. Here, we manage to inhibit this reaction by passivating LiCx in real time via targeted repair of SEI. It is shown that 1,3,5&#8722;trimethyl&#8722;1,3,5&#8722;tris(3,3,3&#8722;trifluoropropyl)cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) can be triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8722;opening polymerization at elevated temperature, so as to targeted repair of fractured SEI. Due to the high thermal stability of polymerized D3F, exothermic reaction between LiCx and electrolyte is inhibited. As a result, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR trigger temperatures of pouch cell are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#176;C. This work opens up a new avenue for designing functional additives to block initial exothermal reaction and inhibit TR in early stage.</dc:description>

The Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;sulfolane&#8208;water hybrid electrolytes based on the deep eutectic solvents present an efficient strategy for hydrogen bond network reconstruction and multifunctional interfaces optimization, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping and excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The corrosion, parasitic reactions, and aggravated dendrite growth severely restrict development of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Here, we report a novel strategy to break the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and construct the Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;sulfolane&#8208;H2O deep eutectic solvents. This strategy cuts off the transfer of protons/hydroxides and inhibits the activity of H2O, as reflected in a much lower freezing point (&lt;&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C), a significantly larger electrochemical stable window (&gt;3&#8197;V), and suppressed evaporative water from electrolytes. Stable Zn plating/stripping for over 9600&#8197;h was obtained. Based on experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, it has been proved that sulfolane can effectively regulate solvation shell and simultaneously build the multifunctional Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the multi&#8208;layer homemade modular cell and 1.32&#8197;Ah pouch cell further confirm its prospect for practical application.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electron Transfer by Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In Sites on In2O3 for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency to generate more radicals is vital to promote the Fenton&#8208;like reaction activity, however, how to promote the PMS adsorption and accelerate the interfacial electron transfer to boost its activation kinetics remain a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Cu&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich In2O3 (Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov) catalysts containing asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites for PMS activation in water purification. The intrinsic catalytic activity is that the side&#8208;on adsorption configuration of the O&#8208;O bond (Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;In) at the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites significantly stretches the O&#8208;O bond length. Meanwhile, the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites increases the electron density near the Fermi energy level, promoting more and faster electron transfer to the O&#8208;O bond for generating more SO4&#8226;&#8208; and &#8226;OH. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov is 31.8 times faster than In2O3/Ov, and it shows the possibility of membrane reactor for practical wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Taxol Enabled by Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Radical Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taxol is a clinically used drug for the treatment of various types of cancers. Its 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) system is substituted by eight oxygen functional groups and flanked by four acyl groups, including a &#946;&#8208;amino acid side chain. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of this unusually oxygenated and intricately fused structure. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions connected the A&#8208; and C&#8208;ring fragments and cyclized the B&#8208;ring, respectively. Functional groups of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings were then efficiently decorated by employing newly developed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective reactions. Finally, construction of the D&#8208;ring and conjugation with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid delivered taxol. The powerful coupling reactions and functional group manipulations implemented in the present synthesis provide new valuable information for designing multistep target&#8208;oriented syntheses of diverse bioactive natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar Phosphorus Chalcogenide Cage Molecules: Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Properties in Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inorganic adduct is an emergent class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05 &#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO&#8208;active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;crystal superstructures via hierarchical assemblies of giant Rubik's cubes as tertiary building units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intricate superstructures possess unusual structural features and promising applications. The preparation of superstructures with single&#8208;crystalline nature are conducive to understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship, however, remains an intriguing challenge. Herein we put forward a new hierarchical assembly strategy towards rational and precise construction of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Firstly, two unprecedented superclusters in Rubik's cube's form with a size of ~ 2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 nm3 are constructed by aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Then, the Rubik's cubes further act as isolable tertiary building units (TBUs) to assemble diversified single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Importantly, intermediate assembly states are captured, which helps illustrate the evolution of TBU&#8208;based superstructures and thus provides a profound understanding of the assembly process of superstructures at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Ynamides: Chemoselective and Divergent Access to Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, allowing various bis(indole) derivatives in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope, which not only represents the first molecular iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C&#8722;C (alkyl) bond cleavage and rearrangement.







Abstract
Herein, an I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, furnishing various functionalized bis(indole) derivatives in generally good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and excellent atom&#8208;economy. This protocol not only represents the first molecular&#8208;iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations, but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage and rearrangement. Moreover, chiral tetrahydropyridine frameworks containing two stereocenters are obtained with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. Meanwhile, cycloisomerization and aromatization of ynamides produce pyrrolyl indoles with high efficiency enabled by I2. Additionally, control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that this reaction probably undergoes a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/rearrangement process.

         <title>Allosteric Regulation of Aptamer Affinity through Mechano&#8208;Chemical Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capacity to precisely modulate aptamer affinity is important for a wide variety of applications. However, most such engineering strategies entail laborious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing or require prior knowledge of an aptamer&#8217;s structure and ligand&#8208;binding domain. We describe here a simple and generalizable strategy for allosteric modulation of aptamer affinity by employing a double&#8208;stranded molecular clamp that destabilizes aptamer secondary structure through mechanical tension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer and show that we can alter its affinity by as much as 65&#8208;fold. We also show that this modulation can be rendered reversible by introducing a restriction enzyme cleavage site into the molecular clamp domain and describe a design strategy for achieving even more finely&#8208;tuned affinity modulation. This strategy requires no prior knowledge of the aptamer&#8217;s structure and binding mechanism and should thus be generalizable across aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cationic Disordering Induces two Distinct Degradation Pathways in Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA) oxides are synthesized through tailoring the heating temperature. The NA oxides with high cation disorder experience a comparably homogeneous fatigue process upon extended cycling, while a disordered surface with lattice mismatch is gradually formed in the NA with low cation disorder (i.e. heterogeneous degradation) which results in a rapid capacity decay during the fast charge&#8211;discharge cycling.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are one of the most attractive cathode materials in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their degradation mechanisms are still not completely elucidated. Herein, we report a strong dependence of degradation pathways on the long&#8208;range cationic disordering of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA). Interestingly, a disordered layered phase with lattice mismatch can be easily formed in the near&#8208;surface region of NA particles with very low cation disorder (NA&#8208;LCD, m&#8804;0.06) over electrochemical cycling, while the layered structure is basically maintained in the core of particles forming a &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structure. Such surface reconstruction triggers a rapid capacity decay during the first 100&#8197;cycles between 2.7 and 4.3&#8197;V at 1&#8197;C or 3&#8197;C. On the contrary, the local lattice distortions are gradually accumulated throughout the whole NA particles with higher degrees of cation disorder (NA&#8208;HCD, 0.06&#8804;m&#8804;0.15) that lead to a slow capacity decay upon cycling.

         <title>Reverse Engineering Caged Compounds: Design Principles for their Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caged compounds are optical probes in which biological signaling molecules are rendered inert by attachment of a photosensitive protecting group (PPG). Following Wittgenstein's dictum &#8220;Meaning is use&#8221;, the key features of such probes are deduced by consideration of the properties of the most widely used caged compounds that have been successfully applied to test numerous biological hypotheses.







Abstract
Light passes through biological tissue, and so it is used for imaging biological processes in situ. Such observation is part of the very essence of science, but mechanistic understanding requires intervention. For more than 50&#8197;years a &#8220;second function&#8221; for light has emerged; namely, that of photochemical control. Caged compounds are biologically inert signaling molecules that are activated by light. These optical probes enable external instruction of biological processes by stimulation of an individual element in complex signaling cascades in its native environment. Cause and effect are linked directly in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains in a quantitative manner by their use. I provide a guide to the basic properties required to make effective caged compounds for the biological sciences.

         <title>Dibenzomethanopentacene&#8208;Based Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Use in Gas&#8208;Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) containing polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) were synthesised showing both high performance for pure and mixed gas permeability/selectivity and reduced ageing. The data for DBMP&#8208;rich PIMs are close to the latest Robeson upper bounds for several important gas pairs indicating their potential for making gas separation membranes.







Abstract
Dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) is shown to be a useful structural component for making Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) with promise for making efficient membranes for gas separations. DBMP&#8208;based monomers for PIMs are readily prepared using a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between 2,3&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and norbornadiene as the key synthetic step. Compared to date for the archetypal PIM&#8208;1, the incorporation of DBMP simultaneously enhances both gas permeability and the ideal selectivity for one gas over another. Hence, both ideal and mixed gas permeability data for DBMP&#8208;rich co&#8208;polymers and an amidoxime modified PIM are close to the current Robeson upper bounds, which define the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, for several important gas pairs. Furthermore, long&#8208;term studies (over &#8776;3&#8197;years) reveal that the reduction in gas permeabilities on ageing is less for DBMP&#8208;containing PIMs relative to that for other high performing PIMs, which is an attractive property for the fabrication of membranes for efficient gas separations.

         <title>The Alarmone Diadenosine Tetraphosphate as a Cosubstrate for Protein AMPylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ap4A was investigated for its potential applicability as a cosubstrate in AMPylation mediated by FICD, instead of the common cosubstrate ATP. Proficient AMPylation capability of Ap4A was observed, and new potential target proteins were found by chemical proteomics. Interestingly, AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the cosubstrate.







Abstract
Diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnAs) are non&#8208;canonical nucleotides whose cellular concentrations increase during stress and are therefore termed alarmones, signaling homeostatic imbalance. Their cellular role is poorly understood. In this work, we assessed ApnAs for their usage as cosubstrates for protein AMPylation, a post&#8208;translational modification in which adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is transferred to proteins. In humans, AMPylation mediated by the AMPylator FICD with ATP as a cosubstrate is a response to ER stress. Herein, we demonstrate that Ap4A is proficiently consumed for AMPylation by FICD. By chemical proteomics using a new chemical probe, we identified new potential AMPylation targets. Interestingly, we found that AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the nucleotide cosubstrate. These results may suggest that signaling at elevated Ap4A levels during cellular stress differs from when Ap4A is present at low concentrations, allowing response to extracellular cues.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Networks Locking on Inorganic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;curvature two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization is proposed to form a single&#8208;layer 2D polymer network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of nanoparticles for their stabilization and functionalization. The 2D polymer network coated on nanoparticle surfaces can be turned into a non&#8208;contact ligand showing excellent shape retention and high nanoparticle&#8208;surface accessibility.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs), single&#8208;layer networks of covalently linked monomers, show perspectives as membranes and in electronics. However, 2D polymerization of monomers in orthogonal directions limited the formation of 2DPs on nanoparticles (NPs) with high surface curvatures. Here we propose a high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization to form a single&#8208;layer 2DP network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of NPs for their stabilization and functionalization. The high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization of amphiphilic Gemini monomers was conducted in situ on surfaces of NPs with various sizes, shapes, and materials, forming highly cross&#8208;linked 2DPs. Selective etching of core&#8211;shell NPs led to 2DPs as a non&#8208;contact ligand of yolk&#8208;shell structures with excellent shape retention and high NP&#8208;surface accessibility. In addition, by copolymerization, the 2DP ligands can covalently link to other functional molecules. This work promotes the development of 2DPs on NPs for their functional modification.

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB Upconversion, Solvent Sensitization and Challenging Bond Activation Enabled by a Benzene&#8208;Based Annihilator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB photon upconversion (UC) enabled by a benzene&#8208;based annihilator is presented for the first time. The annihilator's unprecedented singlet&#8208;excited energy of 4.15&#8197;eV was successfully employed to activate inert carbonyls via a subsequent FRET energy transfer. This UC&#8208;FRET reaction scheme was directly monitored by laser techniques and exploited in lab&#8208;scale NMR experiments demonstrating its potential in light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.







Abstract
Several energy&#8208;demanding photoreactions require harsh UV light from inefficient light sources. The conversion of low&#8208;energy visible light to high&#8208;energy singlet states via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) could offer a solution for driving such reactions under mild conditions. We present the first annihilator with an emission maximum in the UVB region that, combined with an organic sensitizer, is suitable for blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB upconversion. The annihilator singlet was successfully employed as an energy donor in subsequent FRET activations of aliphatic carbonyls. This hitherto unreported UC&#8208;FRET reaction sequence was directly monitored using laser spectroscopy and applied to mechanistic irradiation experiments demonstrating the feasibility of Norrish chemistry. Our results provide clear evidence for a novel blue light&#8208;driven substrate or solvent activation strategy, which is important in the context of developing more sustainable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion systems.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Blue&#8208;Emitting Heteroatom&#8208;Doped MR&#8208;TADF Nonacene for High&#8208;Performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes

A deep blue boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped nonacene emitter that shows multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) is described. The emitter shows bright, deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission in an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device.







Abstract
We present a p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped nonacene compound, NOBNacene, that represents a rare example of a linearly extended ladder&#8208;type multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. This compound shows efficient narrow deep blue emission, with a &#955;PL of 410&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum, FWHM, of 38&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;PL of 71&#8201;%, and a delayed lifetime, &#964;d of 1.18&#8197;ms in 1.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% TSPO1 thin film. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) using this compound as the emitter shows a comparable electroluminescence spectrum peaked at 409&#8197;nm (FWHM=37&#8197;nm) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 8.5&#8201;% at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.173, 0.055). The EQEmax values were increased to 11.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% doping of the emitter within the emissive layer of the device. At this concentration, the electroluminescence spectrum broadened slightly, leading to CIE coordinates of (0.176, 0.068).

         <title>Chemodivergent, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Cycloaddition Reactions between 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are ligand controlled, chemodivergent [4+2] or [2+2] cycloaddition reactions between readily available 1,3&#8208;dienes and alkynes. These reactions, catalyzed by cationic CoI proceed with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivies to give nearly enantiopure functionalized 1,4&#8208; cyclohexadienes or cyclobutenes from the same starting materials.







Abstract
Alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes are among the most readily available precursors for organic synthesis. We report two distinctly different, catalyst&#8208;dependent, modes of regio&#8208; and enantioselective cycloaddition reactions between these classes of compounds providing rapid access to highly functionalized 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes or cyclobutenes from the same precursors. Complexes of an earth abundant metal, cobalt, with several commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligands with narrow bite angles catalyze [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions between a 1,3&#8208;diene and an alkyne giving a cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene in excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In sharp contrast, complex of a finely tuned phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligand promotes unique [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between the alkyne and the terminal double bond of the diene giving a highly functionalized cyclobutene in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Unimer Exchange Is not Necessary for Morphological Transitions in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that morphological transitions during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in water do not require unimer exchanges. The monomer present in the polymerization medium enables morphological transitions although it unexpectedly slows down unimer exchange.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has established itself as a powerful and straightforward method to produce polymeric nano&#8208;objects of various morphologies in (aqueous) solution. Generally, spheres are formed in the early stages of polymerization that may evolve to higher order morphologies (worms or vesicles), as the solvophobic block grows during polymerization. Hitherto, the mechanisms involved in these morphological transitions during PISA are still not well understood. Combining a systematic study of a representative PISA system with rheological measurements, we demonstrate that&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;unimer exchange is not necessary to form higher order morphologies during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA. Instead, in the investigated aqueous PISA, the monomer present in the polymerization medium is responsible for the morphological transitions, even though it slows down unimer exchange.

         <title>Cooperative Catalysis of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Adsorption Competition by Tuning Cationic Geometric Configuration of Dual&#8208;active Sites in Spinel Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation behind attractive physicochemical properties functions as a universal descriptor for determining the geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalysis. By tuning cationic geometric configuration in spinel oxides, the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption competition on Mn3+Oh&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+Td backbones is well leveraged to spark the cooperative catalysis of LiPSs in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Fundamentally understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship is critical to design advanced electrocatalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, by manipulating the regulable cations in spinel oxides, their geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalytic activity for sulfur redox is investigated. Experimental and theoretical analyses validate that the modulation essence of cooperative catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is dominated by LiPSs adsorption competition between Co3+ tetrahedral (Td) and Mn3+ octahedral (Oh) sites on Mn3+Oh&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+Td backbones. Specifically, high&#8208;spin Co3+Td with stronger Co&#8722;S covalency anchors LiPSs persistently, while electron delocalized Mn3+Oh with adsorptive orbital (dz2) functions better in catalyzing specialized LiPSs conversion. This work inaugurates a universal strategy for sculpting geometrical configuration to achieve charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation in electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Reactivity and Recyclability of Ligand&#8208;Protected Metal Cluster Catalysts for CO2 Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;protected metal clusters composed of silver, gold, and copper integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and exhibit an excellent reactivity and recyclability for CO2 formylation with secondary amines. Fundamental insights are provided into the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction and design rules are presented for preparation of metal clusters with high stability and recyclability.







Abstract
It remains a significant challenge to construct an integrated catalyst that combines advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with clarified mechanism and high performance. Here we show atomically precise CuAg cluster catalysts for CO2 capture and utilization, where two functional units are combined into the clusters: metal and ligand. Due to atomic resolution on total and local structures of such catalysts to be achieved, which disentangles heterogeneous imprecise systems and permits tracing the reaction processes via experiments coupled with theory, site&#8208;specific catalysis induced by metal&#8208;ligand synergy can be accurately elucidated. The CuAg cluster catalysts exhibit excellent reactivity and recyclability to forge the C&#8722;N bonding from CO2 formylation with secondary amines that can make the cluster catalysts more unique compared with typically homogeneous complexes.

         <title>Disruption of Zinc Homeostasis by a Novel Platinum(IV)&#8208;Terthiophene Complex for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel cyclometalated PtIV&#8208;terthiophene complex as the first metal&#8208;based zinc homeostatic medicine that regulates zinc homeostasis to activate antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Zinc homeostatic medicine is of great potential for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy; however, there are few reports on antitumor compounds that can trigger Zn2+&#8208;mediated immune responses. In this work, we developed a novel cyclometalated PtIV&#8208;terthiophene complex, Pt3, that not only induces DNA damage and cellular metabolism dysregulation, but also disrupts zinc homeostasis as indicated by the abnormal transcriptional level of zinc regulatory proteins, excess accumulation of Zn2+ in cytoplasm, and down&#8208;regulation of metallothioneins (MTs), which further caused redox imbalance. The simultaneous disruption of zinc and redox homeostasis in response to Pt3 treatment activated gasdermin&#8208;D mediated pyroptosis accompanied by cytoskeleton remodeling, thus releasing pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T cell tumor&#8208;infiltration, eventually eliminating both primary and distant tumors in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first metal complex that can regulate zinc homeostasis to activate antitumor immunity.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Pyrrole&#8208;Fused Heteropine: Synthesis, Properties, and Application in Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report an efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused heteropine compounds and investigated their optical and electronic properties. A &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds have been used as building blocks for numerous organic semiconductors over the past few decades. While the success is based on thiophene&#8208;containing compounds, aromatic compounds that contain thiepine, a sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring arene, has been less well investigated. Here we report the synthesis and properties of &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused heteropine compounds such as thiepine and oxepine. A &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Uncovering Aging Chemistry of Perovskite Precursor Solutions and Anti&#8208;aging Mechanism of Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) is established as a molecular probe to unveil the aging chemistry of perovskite precursor solutions. In addition to uncovering the molecular mechanism of chemical aging reactions, it is demonstrated that the structure and stability difference of precursor&#8208;additive interactions determines the anti&#8208;aging effects of additives.







Abstract
The aging of precursor solutions is the major stumbling block for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time we used the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to molecularly explore the perovskite precursor solution chemistry. We identified that the methylammonium and formamidinium cations and the I&#8722; anion are the motivators of the aging chemistry. Further, we introduced two kinds of Lewis bases, triethyl phosphate (TP) and ethyl ethanesulfonate (EE), as new additives in the solution and unraveled that both of them can protect the reactive cations from aging through weak interactions. Significantly, TP is superior to EE in enhancing long&#8208;term solution stability as it can well&#8208;maintain the internal interaction structures within the solution phase. The PSC derived from a fresh TP&#8208;doped solution delivered a high power conversion efficiency of 23.06&#8201;%, 92.23&#8201;% of which remained in that from a 21&#8208;day&#8208;old solution.

         <title>Tuning the CO2 Hydrogenation Selectivity of Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Zirconium Dioxide with Alkali Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping alkali ions (e.g., Na) into Rh1/ZrO2 enables complete switching of the reaction product from CH4 to CO in CO2 hydrogenation over a broad temperature range. It was found that Na+ ions change the surface intermediate from HCOO* to COOH* and render the Rh1 atoms electron deficient with restrained H2 activation capability and weakened CO adsorption, thus cooperatively boosting CO formation.







Abstract
Tuning the coordination environments of metal single atoms (M1) in single&#8208;atom catalysts has shown large impacts on catalytic activity and stability but often barely on selectivity in thermocatalysis. Here, we report that simultaneously regulating both Rh1 atoms and ZrO2 support with alkali ions (e.g., Na) enables efficient switching of the reaction products from nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 to above 99&#8201;% CO in CO2 hydrogenation in a wide temperature range (240&#8211;440&#8201;&#176;C) along with a record high activity of 9.4&#8197;molCO&#8201;gRh&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 300&#8201;&#176;C and long&#8208;term stability. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations unveil that alkali ions on ZrO2 change the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species during CO2 activation, thus leading to exclusive CO formation. Meanwhile, alkali ions also reinforce the electronic Rh1&#8208;support interactions, endowing the Rh1 atoms more electron deficient, which improves the stability against sintering and inhibits deep hydrogenation of CO to CH4.

         <title>Fluorogenic Granzyme A Substrates Enable Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Adaptive Immune Cell Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe NIR fluorogenic substrates for granzyme A with rapid responses and enzyme sensitivity at physiological levels. We demonstrate that these probes can be used for real&#8208;time imaging of CTLs and NK cells in co&#8208;cultures with cancer cells and in ex vivo tissues, opening new avenues to monitor the functions of the immune system in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the near&#8208;infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These activity&#8208;based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity over other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild&#8208;type and GzmA knock&#8208;out mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how adaptive immune cells respond to antigen&#8208;driven recognition of cancer cells in real time.

PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) were designed to consist of an oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticle core and a dense shell of PD&#8208;L1 aptamer (denoted as M@O&#8208;A), as reported by Zhengyu Jin, Jie Tian, Yang Du, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/ange.202214750). Upon light irradiation, the versatile M@O&#8208;A allows for robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer by combining PDT, chemotherapy with immunotherapy in one nanoplatform with reduced immunotoxicity.

         <title>Crystalline Anions Based on Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable anions based on classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) can be prepared by KC8&#8208;reduction of the corresponding NHC radicals as reported by Diego&#8197;M. Andrada, Rajendra&#8197;S. Ghadwal et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215244). The key to the stability of these anions is the delocalization of the electron lone pair over the C2&#8208;biphenyl substituent. In the solid state, the anions form a hexameric tubular structure with biphenyl substituents pointing inwards, as a result of intriguing cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. The spider weaves its web.

         <title>Stereochemical Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitingly, a recent report from the Wendlandt group solved the epimerization of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers, providing a rapid approach to convert more readily available stereoisomers into stereoisomers that were previously challenging to access (see scheme; HAA=hydrogen atom abstraction; HAD=hydrogen atom donation).







Abstract
Stereochemical editing has recently risen to prominence, allowing the direct editing of organic molecules with stereocenter(s) to adjust their relative stereochemistry at a late&#8208;stage. Several seminal light&#8208;driven stereochemical editing reactions such as deracemization and epimerization have been successively developed. Recently, Wendlandt and co&#8208;workers reported a versatile photochemical epimerization of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers to rapidly prepare the stereoisomers that were previously challenging to access.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperbranched polymethacrylates were synthesized by green&#8208;light&#8208;induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under biologically relevant conditions in the open air. Sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate (SBA) was prepared in situ from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacrylic acid and used as a water&#8208;soluble inibramer to induce branching during the copolymerization of methacrylate monomers. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymethacrylates were obtained in less than 30 min with predetermined molecular weights (36 000 &#706; Mn &#706; 170 000), tunable degree of branching, and low dispersity values (1.14 &#8804; &#272; &#8804; 1.33). Moreover, the use of SBA inibramer enabled the synthesis of bioconjugates with a well&#8208;controlled branched architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for clean and renewable energy technologies, which require no fossil fuel but catalysts. Platinum (Pt) is the best&#8208;known catalyst for ORR. However, its high cost and scarcity have severely hindered renewable energy devices (e.g.,&#160;fuel cells) for large&#8208;scale applications. Recent breakthroughs in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) show great potential for earth&#8208;abundant carbon materials as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts towards ORR in acidic media. This article provides a focused, but critical review on C&#8208;MFECs for ORR in acidic media with an emphasis on advances in the structure design and synthesis, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and electrocatalytic mechanisms, and their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Current challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The recovery of gold from wastewaters is necessary from both environmental and economic standpoints. Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can serve as high capacity and selective adsorbants as shown in the highlighted work from Zhao and co&#8208;workers. Their novel three&#8208;dimension cationic framework goes further than selectively adsorbing AuCl4&#8208;. It also serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the CO2 electrochemical reduction. This work highlights the versatility of MOFs, which can serve as a selective adsorbant and a support for nanoparticle catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elegant geometry of viruses has inspired bio&#8208;engineers to&#160;synthetically explore&#160;the self&#8208;assembly of polyhedral capsids employed to protect new cargo or change an enzymatic microenvironment. Recently, Yang et al. used DNA nanotechnology to revisit the icosahedral capsid structure of the phiX174 bacteriophage and reloaded the original viral genome as cargo into their fully synthetic architecture. Surprisingly, when using a favorable combination of structural rigidity and dynamic multivalent cargo entrapment, the synthetic particles were able to infect non&#8208;competent bacterial cells and produce the original phiX174 bacteriophage. This work presents an exciting new direction of DNA nanotech for bio&#8208;engineering applications which involve bacterial interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Classification for the Prediction of Catalytic Activity of Organic Photosensitizers in the Nickel(II)&#8208;Salt&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic systems using a small amount of organic photosensitizer for the activation of an inorganic (on&#8208;demand ligand&#8208;free) nickel(II) salt represent a cost&#8208;effective method for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while C(sp2)&#8211;O bond formation remains less developed. Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of phenols with a nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer, which was identified via an investigation into the catalytic activity of 60 organic photosensitizers consisting of various electron donor and acceptor moieties. To examine the effect of multiple intractable parameters on the catalytic activity of photosensitizers, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were developed, wherein we embedded descriptors representing their physical and structural properties, which were obtained from DFT calculations and RDKit, respectively. The study clarified that integrating both DFT&#8208; and RDKit&#8208;derived descriptors in ML models balances higher &#8216;precision&#8217; and &#8216;recall&#8217; across a wide range of&#160;search&#160;space relative to using only one of the two descriptor sets.</dc:description>

Herein, we&#160;present&#160;a new hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5] (1, Ph3PEt+&#160;= ethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium),&#160;crystallizing&#160;in a polar space group P1&#160;and exhibiting&#160;thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal&#160;transitions&#160;with relatively low melting temperature of 132 oC, glass&#8208;transition temperature of&#160;40&#160;oC, and recrystallization on&#8208;set temperature of&#160;78&#160;oC, respectively. Taking advantage of such mild conditions, we fabricated&#160;an unprecedented&#160;hybrid&#160;glass&#8208;ceramic thin film, i.e., a thin glass uniformly embedding&#160;inner polar micro&#8208;crystals,&#160;which exhibits&#160;a&#160;much enhanced intrinsic&#160;second&#8208;order nonlinear optical effect,&#160;being&#160;ca. 25.6 and 3.1 times those of poly&#8208;crystalline 1&#160;and KH2PO4, respectively, without any poling treatments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid hydrocarbons exhibit very different optical and electronic properties than those of their well&#8208;studied benzenoid analogs. Yet, preparing such structures with extended conjugation length, remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulenes derivatives using a two&#8208;step sequence involving a four&#8208;fold aldol condensation between aromatic dialdehydes and readily available&#160;tetrahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;(1H,3H)&#8208;dione. Molecules with bandgap values ranging from 1.69 to 2.14 eV and molar extinction coefficient (&#949;) of nearly 3 x 105&#160;M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1&#160;have been prepared. These annulene&#8208;like structures exhibit significant diatropic ring current (aromatic), as supported by&#160;1H NMR and DFT calculations. Field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) using azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives as semiconductors exhibit charge mobility values up to 0.05 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 3,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Azobenzenes upon Complexation by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (2) with azoben&#173;zene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the cis&#8208;isomer. The addition product of 2 is stable, while the adduct of 1 isomerizes in solution in an ortho&#8208;benzidine&#8208;like [3,3]&#8208;rearrange&#173;ment by cleavage of the N&#8211;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen and formation of a new bond between two phenyl ortho&#8208;carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes (R = Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#173;diazene, while ortho&#8208;methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with 1. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectro&#173;scopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrange&#173;ment was explored by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphane, PH3 &#8208; a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas &#8208; is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10 wt% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25 &#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time &#8776; 6 h). Diphosphane P2H4 is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4 months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Design Enabling Stable Polymer/Thiophosphate Electrolyte Separators for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic/inorganic interfaces greatly affect Li+ transport in composite solid electrolytes (SEs), while SE/electrode interfacial stability plays a critical role in the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, incomplete understanding of interfacial (in)stability hinders the practical application of composite SEs in SSBs. Herein, chemical degradation between Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is revealed. The high polarity of PEG changes the electronic state and structural bonding of the PS43&#8722; tetrahedra, thus triggering a series of side reactions. A substituted terminal group of PEG not only stabilizes the inside interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. Moreover, a LiF&#8208;rich layer can effectively prevent side reactions at the Li/SE interface. The results provide insights into the chemical stability of polymer/sulfide composites and demonstrate an interface design to achieve dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A BiVO4 Photoanode with a VOx Layer Bearing Oxygen Vacancies Offers Improved Charge Transfer and Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics is one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, a vanadium oxide (VOx) with enriched oxygen vacancies is conformally grown on BiVO4 photoanodes by a simple photo&#8208;assisted electrodeposition process to address this issue. The optimized BiVO4/VOx photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 6.29 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is ~385% as high as that of its pristine counterpart. A high charge transfer efficiency of 96% is achieved and stable PEC water splitting is realized, with a photocurrent retention rate of 88.3% upon 40 h of testing. The excellent PEC performance is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in VOx that forms undercoordinated sites, which strengthen the adsorption of water molecules onto the active sites and promote charge transfer during oxygen evolution reaction. This work demonstrates the potential of vanadium&#8208;based catalysts for PEC water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning on the Antimicrobial Activity of Gold Nanoclusters Against Multidrug&#8208;resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we show that the addition of thiourea (TU) initiated broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive D&#8208;maltose&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNC&#8208;Mal). For example, AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was effective against multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1 &#181;g/mL&#160;(2.5 &#181;M [Au])&#160;while having 30&#8208;60 times lower in vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. The reaction of AuNC&#8208;Mal and TU generated the antimicrobial species of [Au(TU)2]+ and smaller AuNCs. TU increased the accumulation of Au in bacteria and helped maintain the oxidation state as AuI (vs. AuIII). The modes of action included the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, interference with the CuI regulation and depletion of ATP. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity did not change in the presence of colistin or carbonyl cyanide 3&#8208;chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting that AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was indifferent to the outer membrane barrier and to bacterial efflux pumps.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor chromism from a single chromophore through synergistic coupling of mechanochromic and photochromic subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a versatile mechanophore exhibiting a vividly detectable, light&#8208;regulable multicolor mechanochromism. Such optical features rely on the synergistic coupling of mechanochromic bis&#8208;rhodamine (Rh) and photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE). Poly(methyl acrylate)s incorporating this bis&#8208;mechanophore can be mechanically activated under sonication. The relative distribution of the two distinctly colored and fluorescent Rh ring&#8208;opening products is altered with different magnitudes of applied force. Orthogonal use of the photochromic reaction of the BTE core can strengthen the mechanochromism and gate the mechanofluorescence in polymers. Due to increased conjugation offered by the BTE linker, both force&#8208; and light&#8208;induced optical signals display high contrast. Combined DFT simulated and experimental results reveal that the three subunits (two Rhs and one BTE) in this chromophore are activated sequentially, thus generating switchable three&#8208;colored forms and gradient optical responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Production via Selective Two&#8208;electron Mild Electrochemical Oxidation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines Completely to Dihydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from the previous study that biomass derivatives replace water oxidation for enhancing hydrogen production, we found that mild oxidation was more conductive to cathodic hydrogen production. In this study, maximum Faradaic efficiency (&gt;99%) and lower energy consumption for hydrogen production was achieved by precisely controlling the two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) to dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) in place of the four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines (IQs). Moreover, the high value&#8208;added DHIQs were prepared from THIQs with high selectivity (&gt;99%) at the low potential of 1.36V. Operando electrochemical Raman and density functional theory proved that the high selectivity was attributed to the regulable active species of NiOOH induced by the interaction of Co and Fe for preferentially breaking C&#8208;H bond rather than N&#8208;H of THIQs. This novel method provides important insight into efficient biomass&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited cata&#173;lytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We pro&#173;pose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique which can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were syn&#173;thesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and oper&#173;ando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are par&#173;ticipating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3 A cm&#8208;2, and 24 h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1 A&#183;cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Concentration Sulfolane&#8208;based Electrolyte for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25 M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid SEI with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. LCE also enables excellent cycling stability of NCM523/Li cells at 1 C (90.7% retention after 500 cycles) and 0.3 C (83.3% retention after 1000 cycles). With a low N/P ratio (~2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3% after 100 cycles at 0.3 C. The exploring of the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salts selection, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to the cost effectiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework for Water Harvesting with Fast Kinetics and Low Regeneration Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atmospheric water harvesting represents a promising technique to address water stress. Advanced adsorbents have been rationally designed to achieve high water uptake, yet their water sorption kinetics and regeneration temperature greatly limit water production efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring hydrophobic skeleton, proper hydrophilic site density, and 1D open channels significantly lowered the water diffusion and desorption energy barrier. DHTA&#8208;Pa COF showed a high water uptake of 0.48 g/g at 30% R.H. with a remarkable adsorption rate of 0.72 L/Kg/h (298 K) and a desorption rate of 2.58 L/Kg/h (333 K). Moreover, more than 90% adsorbed water could be released within 20 min at 313 K. This kinetic performance surpassed the reported porous materials and boosted the efficiency for multiple water extraction cycles. It may shed light on the material design strategy to achieve high daily water production with low&#8208;energy input.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;backboned polymers with well&#8208;defined lengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing the backbone of polymers with metal atoms is an attractive strategy to develop new functional polymeric materials, but it has yet to be studied due to the synthesis challenge. Here, metal atoms are interconnected as the backbones of polymers to yield metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs). Rational design of multidentate ligands synthesized via an efficient iterative approach leads to the successful construction of a series of nickel&#8208;backboned polymers&#160;(NBPs) with well&#8208;defined lengths and up to 21 nickel atoms, whose structures are systematically confirmed. These NBPs exhibit strong and length&#8208;depended absorption with narrow bandgaps, offering promising applications in optoelectronic devices and semiconductors. We also demonstrate the high thermal stability and solution processability of such nickel&#8208;backboned polymers. Our results represent a new opportunity to design and synthesize a variety of new metal&#8208;backboned polymers for promising applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructing A Heterogeneous Layer on Lithium Metal Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and High Li&#8208;ion Flux</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing efficient artificial surface electrolyte interface (SEI) film is extremely vital for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, a dense artificial SEI film, in which lithiophilic Zn/LixZny are uniformly but nonconsecutively dispersed in the consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors of LixSiOy, Li2O and LiOH, is constructed via the in&#8208;situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets and Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors can promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of lithium ions, and lower the nucleation barrier. Therefore, a low polarization of ~50 mV for 750 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2 in symmetric cells, and a high capacity retention of 99.2% in full cells with a high LFP areal loading of ~13 mg cm&#8208;2 are achieved. This work offers new sights to develop advanced alkali metal anodes for efficient energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Encapsulating C60 Fullerene into Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often limited by poor charge separation and slow charge transfer kinetics. Herein, a novel MOF photocatalyst is successfully constructed by encapsulating C60 into a nano&#8208;sized Zirconium&#8208;based MOF, NU&#8208;901. By virtue of host&#8208;guest interactions and uneven charge distribution, a substantial electrostatic potential difference is set&#8208;up in C60@NU&#8208;901. The direct consequence is a robust built&#8208;in electric field, which tends to be in C60@NU&#8208;901 10.7 times higher than that found in NU&#8208;901. Driven by it, photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated and transported to the surface. For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaches 22.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for C60@NU&#8208;901, which is among the highest values for MOFs. Our concept of enhancing charge separation by harnessing host&#8208;guest interactions constitutes a promising strategy to design photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8211;S and C&#8211;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered functional dynamics of AsLOV2 by time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance at high magnetic fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present time&#8208;resolved Gd&#8208;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240 GHz for tracking inter&#8208;residue distances during a protein&#8217;s mechanical cycle in solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN as spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin&#8208;7  /  2 EPR&#8208;active center, a short linker, a narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high magnetic fields (8.6 T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we are able to determine that upon light activation, the J  &#945;  &#8208;helix and N&#8208;terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1 s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60 s. TiGGER reveals that the light&#8208;activated longrange mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. Our results demonstrate that TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.</dc:description>

Using TiGGER, we are able to determine that upon light activation, the J  &#945;  -helix and N-terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1 s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60 s. TiGGER reveals that the light-activated longrange mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. Our results demonstrate that TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Difunctionalization of Sulfur Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free difunctionalization of bench&#8208;stable sulfur salts gives facile access to iodo&#8208;substituted sulfides using either diaryliodonium or vinyliodonium salts. The methodology was extended to one&#8208;pot syntheses of electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and efficient late&#8208;stage transformations of medicinally important compounds.







Abstract
Efficient protocols for accessing iodo&#8208;substituted diaryl and aryl(vinyl) sulfides have been developed using iodonium salts as reactive electrophilic arylation and vinylation reagents. The reactions take place under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S&#8208;diarylation, enabling the regioselective late&#8208;stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S&#8208;difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive&#8208;free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of aryl(vinyl) sulfides. A one&#8208;pot strategy combining transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Pure Isotropic Proton NMR Spectra in Solids using Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning provides a powerful and robust approach to remove broadening due to dipolar interactions in proton NMR spectra of solids.







Abstract
The resolution of proton solid&#8208;state NMR spectra is usually limited by broadening arising from dipolar interactions between spins. Magic&#8208;angle spinning alleviates this broadening by inducing coherent averaging. However, even the highest spinning rates experimentally accessible today are not able to completely remove dipolar interactions. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to determine pure isotropic proton spectra from a two&#8208;dimensional set of magic&#8208;angle spinning spectra acquired at different spinning rates. Applying the model to 8 organic solids yields high&#8208;resolution 1H solid&#8208;state NMR spectra with isotropic linewidths in the 50&#8211;400&#8197;Hz range.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom or Dual&#8208;Atom in TiO2 Nanosheet: Which is the Better Choice for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 active center in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favourable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier as compared with single&#8208;atom Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.







Abstract
As rising star materials, single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely reported in the electro&#8208;catalysis area. To answer the key question: single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts, which is better for electrocatalytic urea synthesis? we design two types of catalysts via a vacancy&#8208;anchorage strategy: single&#8208;atom Pd1&#8722;TiO2 and dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 nanosheets. An ultrahigh urea activity of 166.67&#8197;molurea&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h1 with the corresponding 22.54&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved over Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2, which is much higher than that of Pd1&#8722;TiO2. Various characterization including an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and theoretical calculations demonstrate that dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 site in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favorable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier compared with Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.

         <title>The Highly Controlled and Efficient Polymerization of Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordinative chain transfer polymerization permits the controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene, currently the most important monomer for plastic production. The key to the combination of control, very high activity, and an excellent catalyst economy seems to be a Group 4 metal complex stabilized by only one bulky and strongly bound monoanionic ligand. NH+B&#8722;=N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylanilinium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate.







Abstract
The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo&#8208; or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60&#8201;000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N&#8208;ligand.

         <dc:description>The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8211; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant ( gem ) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 ( gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites ( TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the  gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than  TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size, and higher surface area, of  TBA&#8208;V2O5 enables faster lithium insertion kinetics and superior rate performance than  gem&#8208;V2O5.</dc:description>

         <title>Safer Polyurethane Foams with Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of materials classically synthesized from isocyanates, diols, and water. Water is essential for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used for self&#8208;blowing the foams. Due to safety concerns with the production of isocyanates, alternative chemistries have been evaluated and cyclic carbonate systems have shown great promise. In a recent advancement by Bourguignon, Grignard, and Detrembleur, a cyclic carbonate and diamine system is capable of generating CO2 for self&#8208;blowing through hydrolysis of the carbonate&#8208;based monomer. The authors demonstrate that with a simple variation of the diamine monomer a wide range of physical and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties were achievable. This work represents a significant step towards safer and more environmentally friendly PUs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Allylmagnesium Reagents by Hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated&#160;in situ&#160;by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetramine Aspect Ratio and Flexibility Determine Framework Symmetry for Zn8L6 Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We derive design principles for the assembly of rectangular tetramines into Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubic coordination cages. Because of the rectangular, as opposed to square, geometry of the ligand panels, and the possibility of either &#916; or &#923; handedness of each metal center at the eight corners of the pseudo&#8208;cube, many different cage diastereomers are possible. Each of the six tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponents investigated in this work assembled with zinc(II) and 2&#8208;formylpyridine in acetonitrile into a single Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cube diastereomer, however. Each product corresponded to one of four diastereomeric configurations, with T, Th, S6 or D3 symmetry. The preferred diastereomer for a given tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponent was shown to be dependent on its aspect ratio and conformational flexibility. Analysis of computationally modeled individual faces or whole pseudo&#8208;cubes provided insight as to why the observed diastereomers were favored.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conceptually novel catalytic domino approach is presented for the synthesis of highly functional 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,3benzoxazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. Key to the chemoselectivity is a proper design of the precursor to override thermodynamically favored parasitic cyclization processes and empower the formation of the desired product through Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effects. The synthetic diversity of these CO2&#8208;based heterocycles is further demonstrated, and the isolation of a reaction intermediate supports an unusual ringexpansion sequence from an &#945;&#8208;alkylidene, five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate to a six&#8208;membered cyclic carbamate by N&#8208;induced isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Diphosphene HPPH and Isomeric Diphosphinyldene PPH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simplest diphosphene HPPH and isomeric diphosphinyldene PPH2 features prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties that have been of long&#8208;standing interest in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the observation of cis&#8208;HPPH, trans&#8208;HPPH, and PPH2 among the respective laser photolysis products of phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10 K. The identification of these P2H2 isomers with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208;isotope labeling and the quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;F12 level using configuration&#8208;selective vibrational configuration interaction theory (VCI). Bonding analyses suggest that the two conformers of HPPH contain standard PP double bonds, whereas, PPH2 resembles P2 in having partial PP triple bond due to the H2P&#8592;P &#960; bonding interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Textured Zinc Metal Anodes through Regulating Electrodeposition Current for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Photoinduced Interparticle Chemical Communication In&#8208;situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring interparticle chemical communication plays critical role in the nanomaterial synthesis as this communication controls the final structure and stability of global nanoparticles (NPs). Yet most ensemble analytical techniques, which can only reveal average macroscopic information, are unable to elucidate NP&#8208;to&#8208;NP interactions. Here, we use stochastic collision electrochemistry to track the morphology transformation of Ag NPs in photochemical process at the single NP level. By further statistical analysis of time&#8208;resolved current transients, we quantitatively determine the dynamic chemical potential difference and interparticle communication between populations of large and small Ag NPs. The high sensitivity of stochastic collision electrochemistry enables the in&#8208;situ investigation of chemical communication&#8208;dependent transformation kinetics of NPs in photochemical process, shedding light on material design.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2) produced from renewables will have a growing impact on the global energy dynamics towards sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral standards. The share of green H2 is still too low to meet the net&#8208;zero target, while the demand for high&#8208;quality hydrogen continues to rise. These factors amplify the need for economically viable H2 generation technologies. The present article aims at evaluating the existing technologies for high&#8208;quality H2 production based on solar energy. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal reactors and plasma conversion utilize solar power directly or indirectly (as carbon&#8208;neutral electrons) and are reviewed from the prospective of their current development level, technical limitations and future potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Microporosity in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) are a novel class of porous materials that cover a wide range of organic&#8208;based molecular building blocks connected through weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, p&#8208;p stacking, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Despite of their diverse chemical and structural nature, common features to POMMs include solution processability, crystallinity and microporosity. Herein, we focus, for the first time, on the advance of the field of POMMs beyond the archetypical microporosity. In particular, we highlight relevant examples of meso&#8208; and macroporous POMMs, as well as hierchachical ones (micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;, micro&#8208;/macro&#8208; and meso&#8208;/macroporous). We also remark some of their unique properties, and how they can be key in many applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Modified Poly(vinyl Alcohol)s and Their Degradation Using an Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water&#8208;soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical&#8208;chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a general and selective nanostructured cobalt catalyst for the hydrogenation of benzofurans, indoles and benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first selective hydrogenation of benzofurans in the presence of a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal catalyst is reported. The developed optimal catalytic material consists of cobalt&#8208;cobalt oxide core&#8208;shell nanoparticles supported on silica, which has been prepared by the immobilization and pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid complex on silica under argon at 800 &#176;C. This novel catalyst allows for the selective hydrogenation of simple and functionalized benzofurans to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans as well as related heterocycles. The versatility of the reported protocol is showcased by the reduction of selected drugs and deuteration of heterocycles. Further, the stability, recycling, and reusability of the Co&#8208;nanocatalyst are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Reactive Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkylsodium Reagents for Benzylic Aroylation of Toluenes using Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deaggregating the alkyl sodium NaCH2SiMe3&#160;with polydentate nitrogen ligands enables the preparation and characterisation of new, hydrocarbon soluble chelated alkylsodium reagents. Equipped with significantly enhanced metalating power over their organolithium counterparts, these systems can promote controlled sodiation of weakly acidic&#160;benzylic C&#8211;H bonds from a series of toluene derivatives under mild stoichiometric conditions. This has been&#160;demonstrated through the benzylic aroylation of toluenes with Weinreb amides, that delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;arylacetophenones in good to excellent yields. Success in isolating and determining the structures of key organometallic intermediates has provided useful mechanistic insight into these new sodium&#8208;mediated transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Mixed&#8208;Linker Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Switchable Semiconductive Characteristics for Tailorable Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), with diverse metal nodes and designable organic linkers, offer unique opportunities for the rational engineering of semiconducting properties. In this work, we report a mixed&#8208;linker conductive MOF system with both tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) moieties, which allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and semiconductive characteristics. By continuously increasing the molar ratio between tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene), the switching of the semiconducting behaviors from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type was observed along with an increase in electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude (from 2.88 &#215; 10&#8722;7 S m&#8722;1 to 9.26 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S m&#8722;1). Furthermore, mixed&#8208;linker MOFs were applied for the chemiresistive detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the sensing performance was modulated by the corresponding linker ratios, showing synergistic and nonlinear modulation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Chiral Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutanes Enabled by Enantioconvergent Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling of Cyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic substitution of readily available dichlorocyclobutenones and subsequent enantioconvergent Negishi coupling afforded 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted cyclobutenones. Further structural elaborations provided a group of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes with different stereochemical classes.







Abstract
Cyclobutenones provide a straightforward four&#8208;carbon ring platform for further structural elaborations in that every carbon atom of the ring could be potentially functionalized. We report here a nickel catalyzed enantioconvergent Negishi coupling of 4&#8208;iodocyclobutenones with an array of aryl or alkenyl zinc reagents to access enantioenriched 4&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones, from which a modular approach to the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes was demonstrated.

A modified nucleotide for construction of reactive RNA probes that form covalent cross&#8208;linked conjugates with Cys&#8208; or His&#8208;containing peptides and proteins is reported. The nucleotide and probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.







Abstract
Reactive RNA probes are useful for studying and identifying RNA&#8208;binding proteins. To that end, we designed and synthesized chloroacetamide&#8208;linked 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;ATP which was a good substrate for T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription assay to synthesize reactive RNA probes bearing one or several reactive modifications. Modified RNA probes reacted with thiol&#8208;containing molecules as well as with cysteine&#8208; or histidine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable covalent products. They also reacted selectively with RNA&#8208;binding proteins to form cross&#8208;linked conjugates in high conversions thanks to proximity effect. Our modified nucleotide and RNA probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state fluorescent (SSF) carbon dots (CDs) with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained through surface ligand modulation. The emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering the conjugation ability between substituent ligands and carbon core. The developed SSF CDs showed great potential for widespread use in three&#8208;dimensional printing and various types of optical displays.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Epoxidation and Aziridination of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes via Palladium Catalyzed &#963;&#8208;Bond Nucleopalladation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strained spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines were synthesized via three&#8208;component coupling between in situ generated 1&#8208;lithio bicyclo[1.1.0]butane, a broad variety of ketones, aldehydes and N&#8208;tosyl imines, and aryl triflates. The key step involves a highly diastereoselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxyarylation (or aminoarylation) of bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinolate intermediates.







Abstract
The development of preparative methods for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbocycles is gaining increasing importance due to the widespread utility of cyclic compounds in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report the development of a new methodology for the production of spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines containing a cyclobutane motif. In a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process, a bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl sulfoxide is lithiated and added to a ketone, aldehyde or imine, and the resulting intermediate is cross&#8208;coupled with an aryl triflate through C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxy&#8208; or aminopalladation with concomitant epoxide or aziridine formation. After careful optimization, a remarkably efficient reaction was conceived that tolerated a broad variety of both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. Lastly, through several high yielding ring&#8208;opening reactions, we demonstrated the excellent applicability of the products as modular building blocks for the introduction of three&#8208;dimensional structures into target molecules.

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven prodrug photoactivation is highly desirable for applications such as neuromodulation, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. Herein, via triplet fusion, we report on the far red&#8208;light driven photo&#8208;release of an anti&#8208;cancer drug by coupling the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizers with a photocleavable perylene&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer drug. Notably, this metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) strategy can be further advanced when incorporating additional functional dopant (i.e., immunotherapy medicine indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor) and the far&#8208;red responsive triplet fusion pairs in an air&#8208;stable nanoparticle. In this way, we observed efficient inhibition of primary and distant tumors in the mouse model with this IDO inhibitor&#8208;assisted TFP system at record&#8208;low excitation power compared to other photo&#8208;assisted immunotherapy approaches. This metal&#8208;free TFP strategy will spur advancement in photonics and biophotonics fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Folding&#8208;Induced Promotion of Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfers via Proximal Base for Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally flexible, bipyridine&#8208;containing Ru macrocyles have shown a remarkable increase in turnover per Ru center in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Conformational studies in the solid state revealed an increased tendency of the auxiliary base close to the active centers of the larger complexes to undergo intramolecular folding and preorganization, which facilitates proton abstraction in the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) processes play a key role in biocatalytic energy conversion and storage, for example, photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation. Here, we report a series of bipyridine&#8208;containing di&#8208; to tetranuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles 2&#8201;C&#8211;4&#8201;C (bda: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) to promote O&#8722;O bond formation. In photocatalytic water oxidation under neutral conditions, all complexes 2&#8201;C&#8211;4&#8201;C prevail in a folded conformation that support the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway with remarkable turnover frequencies of up to 15.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 per Ru unit respectively. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed an increased tendency for intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and preorganization of the proximal bases close to the active centers for the larger macrocycles. H/D kinetic isotope effect studies and electrochemical data demonstrate the key role of the proximal bipyridines as proton acceptors in lowering the activation barrier for the crucial nucleophilic attack of H2O in the WNA mechanism.

         <title>Computing Arithmetic Functions Using Immobilised Enzymatic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes immobilised in hydrogel beads and compartmentalised in a continuous tank reactor were shown to serve as a novel modular and reusable platform for molecular information processing. With small molecules (peptide&#8208;based substrates and inhibitors) as inputs, the robustness of the platform in performing the fundamental arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication was demonstrated.







Abstract
Living systems use enzymatic reaction networks to process biochemical information and make decisions in response to external or internal stimuli. Herein, we present a modular and reusable platform for molecular information processing using enzymes immobilised in hydrogel beads and compartmentalised in a continuous stirred tank reactor. We demonstrate how this setup allows us to perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction and multiplication, using various concentrations of substrates or inhibitors as inputs and the production of a fluorescent molecule as the readout.

         <title>Recent Applications of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tf2O has been widely used in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progresses of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles, and nitro groups for the development of new reactions, and as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagents in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, not only for the conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing compounds to the triflates, but also for the electrophilic activation and further conversion of amides, sulfoxides, and phosphorus oxides. In recent years, the utilization of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles and nitro groups has become a promising tool for the development of new valuable methods with considerable success. In addition, Tf2O has been used as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagent due to the contained SO2CF3 fragment, and significant progress has been made in this area. This review summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Tf2O in the above two aspects, and aims to illustrate the role and potential application of this reagent in organic synthesis.

         <title>The First Synthesis of Subporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free base subporphyrin, also called subporphyrin can be seen as a contracted porphyrin analogue. Despite its postulated importance, its study was limited by a challenging synthesis while the first isolation of boron(III) subporphyrins was accomplished about 15&#8197;years ago. In a recent report, Kim, Osuka, and Song successfully met this challenge. This seminal work will hopefully pave the road to rich chemistries and applications in materials science.







Abstract
Because of the rich coordination chemistry and unique optical and electrochemical properties, porphyrin analogues have been intensively investigated. Among them, subporphyrins have been long&#8208;awaited molecules, with only their boron complexes known to date because of the crucial role of the central boron atom as a template in synthesis. The challenges related to the synthesis of a genuine subporphyrin (boron&#8208;free) have finally been met and reported in a recent article from Kim, Osuka, and Song. A key strategy of their synthesis lies in the introduction of an exocyclic double bond at the meso&#8208;position and subsequent reduction to obtain macrocyclic conjugation. Considering the fact that the development of porphyrin chemistry is ultimately linked to the availability of free base porphyrins, this seminal work will facilitate studies on coordination chemistry and applications in materials science.

         <title>A Highly Stable, Capacity Dense Carboxylate Viologen Anolyte towards Long&#8208;Duration Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboxylate functionalized viologen is developed as a capacity dense, highly stable anolyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries up to 50&#8197;days of stable cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have received increasing attention as an emergent battery technology for grid&#8208;scale renewable energy storage. However, physicochemical properties of redox&#8208;active organic electrolytes remain fine refinement to maximize their performance in RFBs. Herein, we report a carboxylate functionalized viologen derivative, N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutyrate&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium, (CBu)2V, as a highly stable, high capacity anolyte material under near pH neutral conditions. (CBu)2V can achieve solubility of 2.1&#8197;M and display a reversible, kinetically fast reduction at &#8722;0.43&#8197;V vs NHE at pH&#8197;9. DFT studies revealed that the high solubility of (CBu)2V is attributed to its high molecular polarity while its negative reduction potential is benefitted from electron&#8208;donating carboxylate groups. A 0.89&#8197;V (CBu)2V/(NH)4Fe(CN)6 AORFB demonstrated exceptional energy storage performance, specifically, 100&#8201;% capacity retention with a discharge energy density of 9.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles, power densities of up to 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an energy efficiency of 70&#8201;% at 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. (CBu)2V not only represents the most capacity dense viologen with pendant ionic groups and also exhibits the longest (1200&#8197;hours or 50&#8197;days) and the most stable flow battery performance to date.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell&#8208;Free Biosensors for Antibody Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum using electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensors. The platform is based on programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the transcription of an RNA sequence consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor.







Abstract
We report here the development of an electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensor for antibody detection directly in complex sample matrices with high sensitivity and specificity that is particularly suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The approach is based on the use of programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a specific target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected using a redox&#8208;modified probe strand immobilized to a disposable electrode. The platform couples the features of high sensitivity and specificity of cell&#8208;free systems and the strength of cost&#8208;effectiveness and possible miniaturization provided by the electrochemical detection. We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of three different antibodies, including the clinically&#8208;relevant Anti&#8208;HA antibody.

         <title>Unraveling the Structure Transition and Peroxidase Mimic Activity of Copper Sites over Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed copper&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs, with excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity were prepared from copper glutamate (Glu). The Cu binding sites in Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs had a Cu&#8722;N2C2 structure, and Cu&#8722;O bonds were converted into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. DFT calculations showed that H2O2 was cleaved by Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs by a dual&#8208;site catalytic pathway. The Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs enabled intracellular detection of H2O2.

The lack of systematic structural resolution makes it difficult to build specific transition&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots (TMA&#8208;doped CPDs). Herein, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between Cu atoms and CPDs was evaluated by studying the peroxidase&#8208;like properties of Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs prepared by using copper glutamate (Glu) with a Cu&#8722;N2O2 initial structure. The results showed that the Cu atoms bound to Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs in the form of Cu&#8722;N2C2, indicating that Cu&#8722;O bonds changed into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in other copper&#8208;doped CPDs. Moreover, the carboxyl and amino groups content decreased after copper&#8208;atom doping. Theoretical calculations revealed a dual&#8208;site catalytic mechanism for catalyzing H2O2. The detection of intracellular H2O2 suggested their application prospects. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation and catalytic mechanism of TMA&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs, allowing for the generation specific TMA&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed copper-doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs, with excellent peroxidase-like activity were prepared from copper glutamate (Glu). The Cu binding sites in Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs had a Cu&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure, and Cu&#8722;O bonds were converted into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions.

         <title>Na2Ba[Na2Sn2S7]: Structural Tolerance Factor&#8208;Guided NLO Performance Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the relationships between the structural tolerance factor and the dopant concentration and second&#8208;order susceptibility, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in Na2Ba[Na2Sn2S7] 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42&#8197;eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5&#215;AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12&#215;AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.







Abstract
The strong mutual coupling of and even the opposite change in the key parameters, such as the band gap (Eg) and second&#8208;order harmonic generation (SHG), leads to the extreme scarcity in high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Herein, we report 8 new sulfides, Na2Ba[(AgxNa1&#8722;x)2Sn2S7] (1, x=0; 1&#8197;series, x=0.1&#8211;0.6; Na2Ba[(Li0.58Na0.42)2Sn2S7], 1&#8208;0.6Li); Na2Sr[Cu2Sn2S7] (2); and Na2Ba[Cu2Sn2S7] (3). We use the structural tolerance factor (
) to connect the chemical composition, crystal structure, and NLO properties. Guided by these correlations, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42&#8197;eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5&#215;AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12&#215;AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.

         <title>Nanostructured Heterogeneous Catalysts for Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the use of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions are reviewed and discussed in detail. Synthetic strategies, applications, and external stimuli&#8208;driven processes are compiled, setting the basis for future development in this field.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has inspired a new subarea of chemistry providing a powerful tool to perform novel biocompatible chemospecific reactions in living systems. Following the premise that they do not interfere with biological functions, bioorthogonal reactions are increasingly applied in biomedical research, particularly with respect to genetic encoding systems, fluorogenic reactions for bioimaging, and cancer therapy. This Minireview compiles recent advances in the use of heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions. The synthetic strategies of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based materials, their applicability in the activation of caged fluorophores and prodrugs, and the possibilities of using external stimuli to release therapeutic substances at a specific location in a diseased tissue are discussed. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this emerging field.

         <title>A General Synthetic Route to High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Oxide Nanoparticles and Their Enhanced Solar Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generalization in preparing perovskite oxide nanomaterials with high purity and crystalline quality is crucial to permit their full study and widen their applicative potentials. We provide a generic and robust chemical bath route for synthesizing nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 nanoparticles oxides (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al) by simply changing the desired nitrate salts.







Abstract
The main limitations of current methods for synthesizing perovskite oxide (ABO3) nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., the high reagent costs and sophisticated equipment, the long time and high&#8208;temperature processing, or multiple post&#8208;processing and thermal treatment steps, hamper their full study and potential application. Here, we use a facile low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) chemical bath synthesis and only one annealing step to successfully produce high phase purity and crystalline quality nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 NPs (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al). We also show the versatility of this approach by fabricating La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 solid solution and non&#8208;RE&#8208;based BiFeO3 perovskite. To assess the potential of the as&#8208;prepared REFeO3 and REMnO3 NPs, they are used for photocatalytic degradation of the norfloxacin antibiotic and show high efficiency. We believe this easy, robust, versatile, and general route for synthesizing ABO3&#8208;based NPs can be further explored in the vast perovskite family and beyond.

         <title>Decreased Water Mobility Contributes To Increased &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ions can influence the mobility of water molecules in the solvation shell of a protein, which is important for folding and function. We show ions that decrease water mobility contribute to decreased protein mobility and subsequently to an increase in the self&#8208;association and aggregation rate. Alteration in water mobility may occur in ageing cells where ion concentrations become dysregulated and therefore promote &#945;Syn aggregation.







Abstract
The solvation shell is essential for the folding and function of proteins, but how it contributes to protein misfolding and aggregation has still to be elucidated. We show that the mobility of solvation shell H2O molecules influences the aggregation rate of the amyloid protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn), a protein associated with Parkinson's disease. When the mobility of H2O within the solvation shell is reduced by the presence of NaCl, &#945;Syn aggregation rate increases. Conversely, in the presence CsI the mobility of the solvation shell is increased and &#945;Syn aggregation is reduced. Changing the solvent from H2O to D2O leads to increased aggregation rates, indicating a solvent driven effect. We show the increased aggregation rate is not directly due to a change in the structural conformations of &#945;Syn, it is also influenced by a reduction in both the H2O mobility and &#945;Syn mobility. We propose that reduced mobility of &#945;Syn contributes to increased aggregation by promoting intermolecular interactions.

When the mobility of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O within the solvation shell is reduced by the presence of NaCl, &#945;Syn aggregation rate increases. Conversely, in the presence CsI the mobility of the solvation shell is increased and &#945;Syn aggregation is reduced. Changing the solvent from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O leads to increased aggregation rates, indicating a solvent driven effect. We show the increased aggregation rate is not directly due to a change in the structural conformations of &#945;Syn, it is also influenced by a reduction in both the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mobility and &#945;Syn mobility. We propose that reduced mobility of &#945;Syn contributes to increased aggregation by promoting intermolecular interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stability Challenges and Opportunities in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale application of polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is suffering from long&#8208;term stability challenges in anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This review provides a thorough discussion of degradation mechanisms, catalyst design principles and future research opportunities to serve as a cornerstone for overcoming the dilemma in acidic OER stability and achieving the industrialization of water electrolysis.







Abstract
Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has been regarded as a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability impose a grand challenge in its large&#8208;scale industrialization. In this review, critical factors that may lead to catalyst's instability in couple with potential solutions are comprehensively discussed, including mechanical peeling, substrate corrosion, active&#8208;site over&#8208;oxidation/dissolution, reconstruction, oxide crystal structure collapse through the lattice oxygen&#8208;participated reaction pathway, etc. Last but not least, personal prospects are provided in terms of rigorous stability evaluation criteria, in situ/operando characterizations, economic feasibility and practical electrolyzer consideration, highlighting the ternary relationship of structure evolution, industrial&#8208;relevant activity and stability to serve as a roadmap towards the ultimate application of PEMWE.

         <title>An Anomalous Electron Configuration Among 3d Transition Metal Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special [Ar]4s1 electron configuration was revealed for Sc2+ in ScS, with no typical 3d orbital features and a bare population of t2g orbital from electron density reconstruction and orbital population analysis. Our work should be the first to report such anomalous electron structure with preferred 4s over 3d orbital for 3d transition metal atoms and may provide a new method to modulate material properties via artificial orbital adjustment.







Abstract
Physical properties of materials are mainly determined by valence electron configurations, where different valence shells would induce divergent phenomena. In compounds containing Sc2+, 3d electron occupancy is expected, the same as other transition metal atoms like Ti3+. But this situation still awaits experimental verification in inorganic materials. Here, we selected ScS to measure the valence electron density and orbital population of Sc2+ through delicate quantitative convergent&#8208;beam electron diffraction. With the absence of 3d orbital features around Sc&#8208;atom sites and the nearly bare population of t2g orbital, the unintuitive occupation of 4s orbital in Sc2+ is concluded. It should be the first time to report such a special electron configuration in a transition metal compound, in which 4s rather than 3d orbital is preferred. Our findings reveal the distinct behavior of Sc and probable ways to modulate material properties by controlling electron orbitals.

         <title>Ranking Peptide Binders by Affinity with AlphaFold
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlphaFold is transforming the field of protein structure prediction. Standing on its highly accurate mapping between protein sequence and structure, we discovered a novel way to predict the ranking of peptide binding affinities through a competitive binding assay. While there are still limitations, we anticipate this approach can be easily adopted for identifying higher affinity peptide binders.







Abstract
AlphaFold has revolutionized structural biology by predicting highly accurate structures of proteins and their complexes with peptides and other proteins. However, for protein&#8208;peptide systems, we are also interested in identifying the highest affinity binder among a set of candidate peptides. We present a novel competitive binding assay using AlphaFold to predict structures of the receptor in the presence of two peptides. For systems in which the individual structures of the peptides are well predicted, the assay captures the higher affinity binder in the bound state, and the other peptide in the unbound form with statistical significance. We test the application on six protein receptors for which we have experimental binding affinities to several peptides. We find that the assay is best suited for identifying medium to strong peptide binders that adopt stable secondary structures upon binding.

         <title>Amyloid Against Amyloid: Dimeric Amyloid Fragment Ameliorates Cognitive Impairments by Direct Clearance of Oligomers and Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the N&#8208;terminal of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, we designed a dimeric A&#946;(1&#8211;17)&#8208;based peptide drug that crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier and dissociates amyloid plaques and oligomers upon administration to transgenic Alzheimer model mice.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in the form of neurotoxic aggregates is regarded as the main pathological initiator and key therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease. However, anti&#8208;A&#946; drug development has been impeded by the lack of a target needed for structure&#8208;based drug design and low permeability of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). An attractive therapeutic strategy is the development of amyloid&#8208;based anti&#8208;A&#946; peptidomimetics that exploit the self&#8208;assembling nature of A&#946; and penetrate the BBB. Herein, we designed a dimeric peptide drug candidate based on the N&#8208;terminal fragment of A&#946;, DAB, found to cross the BBB and solubilize A&#946; oligomers and fibrils. Administration of DAB reduced amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice, and downregulated neuroinflammation and prevented memory impairment in the Y&#8208;maze test. Peptide mapping assays and molecular docking studies were utilized to elucidate DAB&#8208;A&#946; interaction. To further understand the active regions of DAB, we assessed the dissociative activity of DAB with sequence modifications.

         <title>An Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Reporter for In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporter (i.e., DMP2) is designed to specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence upon binding to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibrils via a suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect. Benefiting from high specificity in response to A&#946; fibrils and suitable lipophilicity to penetrate BBB, DMP2 achieves in vivo visualization of A&#946; plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for in vivo visualization of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology, which can facilitate characterization and deep understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it has been rarely exploited. Herein, we report the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporters with a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) architecture for specific detection of A&#946; plaques in AD&#8208;model mice. Among all the designed probes, DMP2 exhibits the highest affinity to A&#946; fibrils and can specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence after binding to A&#946; fibrils via suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. With suitable lipophilicity for ideal blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability and deep&#8208;tissue penetration of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, DMP2 possesses specific detection of A&#946; plaques in in vivo AD&#8208;model mice. Thus, this study presents a potential agent for non&#8208;invasive imaging of A&#946; plaques and deep deciphering of AD progression.

Among all the designed probes, DMP2 exhibits the highest affinity to A&#946; fibrils and can specifically activate its NIR-II fluorescence after binding to A&#946; fibrils via suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. With suitable lipophilicity for ideal blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability and deep-tissue penetration of NIR-II fluorescence, DMP2 possesses specific detection of A&#946; plaques in in vivo AD-model mice. Thus, this study presents a potential agent for non-invasive imaging of A&#946; plaques and deep deciphering of AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Activity of Enzyme Immobilized on Hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 Modified by Ni2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize enzyme on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor, which can significantly promote the recyclability and activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
The development of efficient enzyme immobilization to promote their recyclability and activity is highly desirable. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been proved to be an effective platform for enzyme immobilization due to its easy preparation and biocompatibility. However, the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic hinders its further development in this filed. Herein, a facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize pepsin (PEP) on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni). By contrast, the direct coating of PEP on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP) generated significant conformational changes. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was employed to study the catalytic activity of immobilized PEP. The ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni composite attains remarkable OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of only 127&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is much lower than the 690 and 919&#8197;mV overpotential values of ZIF&#8208;8@PEP and PEP, respectively.

         <title>Quantitative Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay which allows imaging of single biomolecules with nanometer resolution based on localizing the repeated electrochemiluminescence reactions. Quantification of biomolecules is achieved by merging the clustered reactions at one molecule site and then counting the merged molecule numbers.







Abstract
A single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is developed here which allows imaging and direct quantification of single biomolecules. Imaging single biomolecules is realized by localizing the electrochemiluminescence events of the labeled molecules. Such an imaging system allows mapping the spatial distribution of biomolecules with electrochemiluminescence and contains quantitative single&#8208;molecule insights. We further quantify biomolecules by spatiotemporally merging the repeated reactions at one molecule site and then counting the clustered molecules. The proposed single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen, showing a limit of detection of 67 attomole concentration which is 10&#8201;000 times better than conventional electrochemiluminescence bioassays. This spatial resolution and sensitivity enable single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay a new toolbox for both specific bioimaging and ultrasensitive quantitative analysis.

         <title>Direct Excitation of Aldehyde to Activate the C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond by Cobaloxime Catalysis toward Fluorenones Synthesis with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct excitation of aldehydes to activate their C(sp2)&#8722;H bond through cobaloxime catalysis has been successfully developed. Upon irradiation, the highly reactive photoexcited triplet state of aromatic aldehyde intermediates is intercepted by the catalyst in the ground state, thus leading to the synthesis of a series of fluorenones, xanthones and thioxanthones in good to excellent yields without any external oxidants and with hydrogen as the byproduct.







Abstract
A new way to form fluorenones via the direct excitation of substrates instead of photocatalyst to activate the C(sp2)&#8722;H bond under redox&#8208;neutral condition is reported. Our design relies on the photoexcited aromatic aldehyde intermediates that can be intercepted by cobaloxime catalyst through single electron transfer for following &#946;&#8208;H elimination. The generation of acyl radical and successful interception by a metal catalyst cobaloxime avoid the use of a photocatalyst and stoichiometric external oxidants, affording a series of highly substituted fluorenones, including six&#8208;membered ketones, such as xanthone and thioxanthone derivatives in good to excellent yields, and with hydrogen as the only byproduct. This catalytic system features a readily available metal catalyst, mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, in which sunlight reaction and scale&#8208;up experiments by continuous&#8208;flow approach make the new methodology sustainable and amenable for potentially operational procedures.

         <title>Mechanisms and Synthetic Strategies in Visible Light&#8208;Driven [2+2]&#8208;Heterocycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between alkenes and carbonyls is a formidable strategy for the synthesis of complex strained 3D architectures. This Review provides an overview on the recent development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions driven by visible light. The diverse synthetic approaches are presented with special emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms along with possible future directions of the field.







Abstract
The synthesis of four membered heterocycles usually requires multi&#8208;step procedures and prefunctionalized reactants. A straightforward alternative is the photochemical [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between an alkene and a carbonyl derivative, conventionally based on the photoexcitation of this latter. However, this approach is limited by the absorption profile of the carbonyl, requiring in most of the cases the use of high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;light, that often results in undesired side reactions and/or the degradation of the reaction components. The development of new and milder visible light&#8208;driven [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions is, therefore, highly desirable. In this Review, we highlight the most relevant achievements in the development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions promoted by visible light, with a particular emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms. The open challenges will also be discussed, suggesting new possible evolutions, and stimulating new methodological developments in the field.

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Methylenecyclobutanes: Scope and Selectivity in an Unusual Setting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylenecyclobutanes undergo Wacker oxidation towards cyclopentanones under mild reaction conditions. A semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement is proposed to be responsible for the intermediary 1,2&#8208;shift, which not only explains the formation of the products, but also rationalizes the reaction outcomes in terms of site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Methylenecyclobutanes are found to undergo Wacker oxidation via a semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement. Key to a successful process is the use of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as oxidant, which not only enables efficient catalyst turn&#8208;over but also ensures high Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions. Thus, cyclopentanones (26 examples) can be accessed in an overall good yield and excellent selectivity (up to 97&#8201;% yield, generally &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 ketone:aldehyde ratio). Stereochemical analysis of the reaction sequence reveals migration aptitudes in line with related 1,2&#8208;shifts. By introducing a pyox ligand to palladium, prochiral methylenecyclobutanes can be desymmetrized, thus realizing the first enantioselective Wacker oxidation.

         <title>A Widely Distributed Biosynthetic Cassette Is Responsible for Diverse Plant Side Chain Cross&#8208;Linked Cyclopeptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopeptide alkaloids are a diverse class of plants natural products, yet little is known of their biosynthesis. By combining transcriptomics and genome mining, we uncover a widespread biosynthetic cassette responsible for side chain cross&#8208;linked cyclopeptides. We validate these observations by isolating a new cyclopeptide from Coffea arabica and reconstituting enzymatic activity for the family defining split BURP peptide cyclase.







Abstract
Cyclopeptide alkaloids are an abundant class of plant cyclopeptides with over 200 analogs described and bioactivities ranging from analgesic to antiviral. While these natural products have been known for decades, their biosynthetic basis remains unclear. Using a transcriptome&#8208;mining approach, we link the cyclopeptide alkaloids from Ceanothus americanus to dedicated RiPP precursor peptides and identify new, widely distributed split BURP peptide cyclase containing gene clusters. Guided by our bioinformatic analysis, we identify and isolate new cyclopeptides from Coffea arabica, which we named arabipeptins. Reconstitution of the enzyme activity for the BURP found in the biosynthesis of arabipeptin A validates the activity of the newly discovered split BURP peptide cyclases. These results expand our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for diverse cyclic plant peptides and suggest that these side chain cross&#8208;link modifications are widely distributed in eudicots.

         <title>Constructing Mechanical Shuttles in a Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Porous Architecture for Selective Transport of Lithium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crown ether mechanically interlocked three&#8208;dimensional porous architecture is prepared as the porous filler of mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The mechanical shuttles speed up the ion transport in the adsorbent solid, leading to a rapid and selective transport of lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) extraction from brines is a major barrier to the sustainable development of batteries and alloys; however, current separation technology suffers from a trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and permeability. Herein, a crown ether mechanically interlocked 3D porous organic framework (Crown&#8208;POF) was prepared as the porous filler of thin&#8208;film nanocomposite membranes. Crown&#8208;POF with penta&#8208;coordinated (four Ocrown atoms and one Ntert&#8208;amine atom) adsorption sites enables a special recognition for Li+ ion. Moreover, the four Ntert&#8208;amine atoms on each POF branch facilitate the flipping motion of Li+ ion along the skeletal thread, while retaining the specified binding pattern. Accordingly, the crown ether interlocked POF network displays an ultrafast ion transfer rate, over 10&#8197;times that of the conventional porous materials. Notably, the nanocomposite membrane gives high speed and selectivity for Li+ ion transport as compared with other porous solid&#8208;based mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Peptidyl&#8208;Cysteine Oxidation by the Copper&#8208;Dependent Formylglycine&#8208;Generating Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM calculations reveal the reaction mechanism of the FGE&#8208;catalyzed oxidative conversion of peptidyl&#8208;cysteines into formylglycine. Triplet&#8208;singlet crossing initiates the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate to generate a CuII&#8722;OOH species. A nearby water molecule plays a vital role in the formation of the CuI&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, which is the key species that can undergo O&#8722;O bond cleavage to give formylglycine.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;dependent formylglycine&#8208;generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxygen&#8208;dependent oxidation of specific peptidyl&#8208;cysteine residues to formylglycine. Our QM/MM calculations provide a very likely mechanism for this transformation. The reaction starts with dioxygen binding to the tris&#8208;thiolate CuI center to form a triplet CuII&#8208;superoxide complex. The rate&#8208;determining hydrogen atom abstraction involves a triplet&#8208;singlet crossing to form a CuII&#8722;OOH species that couples with the substrate radical, leading to a CuI&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate. This is accompanied by proton transfer from the hydroperoxide to the S atom of the substrate via a nearby water molecule. The subsequent O&#8722;O bond cleavage is coupled with the C&#8722;S bond breaking that generates the formylglycine and a CuII&#8208;oxyl complex. Moreover, our results suggest that the aldehyde oxygen of the final product originates from O2, which will be useful for future experimental work.

         <title>Porous Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced porous materials (APMs) including MOFs, COFs, and POPs, have seen tremendous development as effective adsorbents for the segregation of components of interest. In this Review, recent advancements of APMs applied for water purification are overviewed systematically according to the type of water contaminant.







Abstract
Water pollution is a growing threat to humanity due to the pervasiveness of contaminants in water bodies. Significant efforts have been made to separate these hazardous components to purify polluted water through various methods. However, conventional remediation methods suffer from limitations such as low uptake capacity or selectivity, and current water quality standards cannot be met. Recently, advanced porous materials (APMs) have shown promise in improved segregation of contaminants compared to traditional porous materials in uptake capacity and selectivity. These materials feature merits of high surface area and versatile functionality, rendering them ideal platforms for the design of novel adsorbents. This Review summarizes the development and employment of APMs in a variety of water treatments accompanied by assessments of task&#8208;specific adsorption performance. Finally, we discuss our perspectives on future opportunities for APMs in water purification.

Luminescent materials with dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence were developed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate, respectively. It is found that their afterglow can be excited by ultraviolet and white light, and the persistent luminescence colors can be tuned by varying temperatures and dopant concentrations.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow excited by ultraviolet (UV) and white light was achieved from classical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching compounds for the first time. Specifically, two luminescent systems, which could produce significant organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence under ambient conditions, were constructed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate. Their lifetimes surpassed 600&#8197;ms, and the dopant concentrations were as low as 5&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Moreover, the persistent luminescence colors of the materials could be tuned from blue to green and then to yellow by simply varying the concentrations of guest compounds or the temperature in the range of 260&#8211;340&#8197;K. Inspired by these exciting results, the afterglow materials were used for UV&#8208; and white&#8208;light&#8208;manipulated anti&#8208;counterfeiting and preparation of elastomers with different colors of persistent luminescence.

         <title>Organoboron Reagent&#8208;Controlled Selective (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein reported an electrochemical selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction of trifluoroacetamides. The reaction which exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control and delivers (deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;products in good yields with high level of deuterium incorporation, respectively, is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources and (deuterated)water as the deuterium or hydrogen source.







Abstract
(Deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;moieties are of high interest in drug discovery. The high demand for the incorporation of these fluoroalkyl moieties into molecular structures has witnessed significant synthetic progress, particularly in the (deutero)hydrodefluorination of CF3&#8208;containing compounds. However, the controllable replacement of fluorine atoms while maintaining high chemoselectivity remains challenging. Herein, we describe the development of a selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction via electrolysis. The reaction exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control, which is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources. The procedure is operationally simple and scalable, and provides access in one step to high&#8208;value building blocks for application in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the reaction mechanism and to rationalize the chemoselectivity observed.

         <title>Altering Oxygen Binding by Redox&#8208;Inactive Metal Substitution to Control Catalytic Activity: Oxygen Reduction on Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles as a Model System
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted manganese oxide nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M, were studied as a model system to generalize the electronic effect of redox&#8208;inactive substituents on the electrocatalytic activity of the oxides. The oxygen reduction activity of Mn3O4:M correlates with the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ site. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of materials that influence their performance will advance the rational engineering of new catalytic materials. In this study, by investigating metal&#8208;substituted manganese oxide (spinel) nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M (M=Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), we rationalize the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide, &#916;fH&#176;(MO), and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M with low &#916;fH&#176;(MO) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which affects its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the rational substitution/doping by redox&#8208;inactive elements.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroarenes are abundant and readily available feedstocks. However, due to the high reduction potentials of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes, their photoreduction remains a continuing challenge, motivating the development of efficient activation modes to address this issue. This report presents the blue light&#8208;induced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed single electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings. We discovered that under blue light irradiation, NHC/tBuOK combination could construct powerful photoactive architectures to promote single electron transfer for Caryl&#8211;F bond reduction via forming highly reducing NHC radical anion. Notably, the strategy was also successful to reduce Caryl&#8211;O, Caryl&#8211;N, and Caryl&#8211;S bonds for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine Dimers and Their Low&#8208;Temperature Isomerization: A High&#8208;Resolution Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding between two neutral aromatic compounds, especially small ones, has been controversially debated in the last decades, and terms like &#8220;&#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; had to be revised. Surprisingly, despite of many experimental and computational work, there is still no clear consensus about the structure of and the bonding in the pyridine dimer. In this work, for different isomeric forms of the pyridine dimer, the structures and bonding were elucidated by combining high&#8208;resolution matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic results with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. High&#8208;resolution IR spectra of Ne matrices at 4 K containing pyridine were recorded for different concentrations and upon annealing to 10 and 12 K, relying on three isotopologues of pyridine. The spectra show the presence of hydrogen&#8208;bonded, T&#8208;shaped, and stacked forms of weakly&#8208;bound pyridine dimers. Among these, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded isomer is identified as the lowest&#8208;energy form. The results provide for the first time conclusive information about the interaction between two pyridine dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>High Electron Mobility Hot&#8208;Exciton Induced Delayed Fluorescent Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is of great significance for the fabrication of miniaturized optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting transistors. However, great challenge exists in designing key materials, especially those who integrates triplet exciton utilization ability. Herein, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs), with 2,6&#8208;extended anthracene donor, and 3&#8217;&#8208; or 4&#8217;&#8208;substituted naphthalene monoimide acceptors were designed and synthesized. By introducing acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor structure, both materials show high electron mobility. Moreover, by fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26%, high electron mobility of 0.02 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, and the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence was obtained in 4&#8217;&#8208;DNADI. This work opens a new avenue for developing high electron mobility emissive organic semiconductors with efficient utilization of triplet excitons.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208;Linker&#8208;Enabled Exceptional Volumetric Acetylene Storage Capacity and Benchmark C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An ideal adsorbent for separation requires optimizing both storage capacity and selectivity, but maximizing both or achieving a desired balance remain challenging. Herein, a de&#8208;linker strategy is proposed to address this issue for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Broadly speaking, the de&#8208;linker idea targets a class of materials that may be viewed as being intermediate between zeolites and MOFs. Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs (SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;M, M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU&#8208;98 exhibit high volumetric C2H2 uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3 cm3 cm&#8208;3 @ 0.1 bar, 222.9 cm3 cm&#8208;3 @ 1 bar, 298 K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C2H2/C2H4, 22.7 for C2H2/CO2). Remarkably, SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;Mn can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with a benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325 min g&#8208;1, and produce 99.9999% C2H4 with a productivity up to 64.6 mmol g&#8208;1, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Hydrogenation of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Lactams Enabled by Switching the N&#8208;Chirality of Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central chirality is an important chiral element used in the design of chiral ligands and catalysts. Mostly, the attention of organic chemists is focused on the development of chiral ligands with stable stereogenic centers. However, the N&#8208;chirality in chiral ligand design has been ignored for long time due to its flexibility. Here we demonstrate that the design, synthesis and application of a class of simple P,N&#8208;ligands with flexible N&#8208;based stereogenic center and their derived iridium complexes with fixed N&#8208;based stereogenic center. Both fixed configurations of the N&#8208;stereocenter of the iridium complexes could be selectively formed from the same chiral ligand. This pair of diastereoisomeric iridium complexes showed good performance in the enantiodivergent asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated lactams. The N&#8208;based stereocenter plays an impressive role in enantio&#8208;inducing control. Computational studies emphasized the importance of N&#8208;chirality in the design/development of chiral ligands in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids by Manganese Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid molecules via an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and primary alcohols. A bench&#8208;stable manganese complex catalyzed the reaction, which is scalable, with the product being isolated with high yields and selectivities under mild conditions. The protocol is environmentally benign, producing water and hydrogen gas as the only byproducts. Methanol can also be used as a C1 source for producing the platform molecule lactic acid, with a high turnover of &gt;104. The methodology was also used to functionalize alcohols derived from natural products and fatty acids. Furthermore, it was applied for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;amino acid, &#945;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acid, and several drugs and bioactive molecules, including endogenous metabolites, Danshensu, Enalapril, Lisinopril, and Rosmarinic acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed to shed light on the mechanism involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multifluorination Strategy Toward Wide Bandgap Polymers for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating new electron&#8208;deficient unit is highly demanded to develop high&#8208;performance polymer donors for non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we reported a multifluorinated unit 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluoronaphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithio&#8208;phene (FNT) and its polymers PFNT&#8208;F and PFNT&#8208;Cl. The advantages of multifluorination: (1) it enables the polymers to exhibit low&#8208;lying HOMO (~ &#8208;5.5 eV) and wide bandgap (~ 2.0 eV); (2) the short interactions (F&#183;&#183;&#183;H, F&#183;&#183;&#183;F) endow the polymers with properties of high film crystallinity and efficient hole transport; (3) well miscibility with NFAs that leads to a more well&#8208;defined nanofibrous morphology and face&#8208;on orientation in the blend films. Therefore, the PFNT&#8208;F/Cl:N3 based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53 % and 18.10 %, which make them ranked the best donor materials in OSCs. This work offers new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance polymers by multifluorination strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Evoke Pyroptosis for High&#8208;Efficiency Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been applied in various tumor therapies, the intrinsic immunogenicity remains unclear. Here, we initiatively discover that ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (NPs) can intrinsically induce pyroptosis by a caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;dependent pathway. The pyroptotic cell death is accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD) simultaneously for efficient in situ immunity initiation. Meanwhile, carbonyl cyanide m&#8208;chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial depolarizing agent, is successfully loaded into ZIF&#8208;8 NPs and found to further enhance the pyroptosis process. Collectively, the obtained Pluronic F127&#8208;modified CCCP&#8208;incorporated ZIF&#8208;8 NPs (F127ZIF&#8208;8CCCP NPs) activate antitumor immunity and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing high&#8208;efficiency tumor growth inhibition. This work will facilitate biomedicine applications of ZIF&#8208;8 and provide good inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;induced cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Ni/V2O3 Heterostructure Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal&#8208;free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM&#8208;free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel&#8208;based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel&#8208;vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/V2O3 catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038 mA cm&#8208;2 and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/V2O3 interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Receptors with&#160;Micromolar Affinity for Chloride in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A water&#8208;soluble coordination cage was obtained by reaction of Pd(NO3)2 with a 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligand featuring a short PEG chain. The cavity of the metal&#8208;organic cage contains one nitrate anion, which is readily replaced by chloride. The apparent association constant for chloride binding in buffered aqueous solution is Ka = 1.8(&#177;0.1)&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#160;M&#8211;1. This value is significantly higher than what has been reported for other macrocyclic chloride receptors. The heavier halides Br&#8211; and I&#8211; compete with binding or self&#8208;assembly, but the receptor displays very good selectivity over common anions such as phosphate, acetate, carbonate, and sulfate. A further increase of the chloride binding affinity by a factor of 3 was achieved using a fluorinated dipyridyl ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Formal Double C&#8211;H Oxidation of Prenylated Molecules to Alkylidene Oxetanes and Azetidines by Strain&#8208;Enabled Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenylation is a ubiquitous late&#8208;stage modification in nature that often confers significantly improved bioactivity for secondary metabolites. While this lipophilic modification renders enhanced potency, the lipophilic tag(s) can diminish bioavailability and adversely alter drug transportation and metabolism. Thus, a functional group tolerant, mild, and selective late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization of prenyl tags would present a great potential in drug discovery programs but could also impact other fields, such as agrochemistry and chemical biology. Herein we report an exocyclic strain driven cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of prenyl tags, a formal double C&#8211;H oxidation protocol, that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This methodology avoids the need of pre&#8208;functionalization of target molecules and affords an easy access to an unprecedented library of oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;prenylated complex molecules. Thus, in a broader context, this methodology extends late&#8208;stage functionalization beyond that available to nature</dc:description>
