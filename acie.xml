      <title>Oligosilanes as Silyl Radical Precursors through Oxidative Si&#8722;Si Bond Cleavage using Redox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Oligosilanes are of great interest in the fields of organic photonics and electronics. In this communication, a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes through cleavage of a trimethylsilyl&#8208;polysilanyl Si&#8722;Si bond is explored. These reactions smoothly occur on readily available organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes and other oligosilanes in the presence of an Ir  III  &#8208;based photo&#8208;redox catalyst under visible light irradiation. Silyl radicals are generated through single electron oxidation of the oligosilane assisted by the solvent. The introduced method exhibits broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance with respect to the organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silane and alkene components, enabling the construction of functionalized trisilanes. In addition, this catalytic system can be also applied to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as silyl radical acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling between Hydrazine and Aryl Halides with Hydroxide Base at Low Loadings of Palladium by Rate&#8208;Determining Deprotonation of Bound Hydrazine</title>
      <dc:description>We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N coupling of hydrazine with (hetero)aryl chlorides and bromides to form aryl hydrazines with catalyst loadings as low as 100 ppm of Pd and KOH. Mechanistic studies revealed two catalyst resting states: an arylpalladium(II) hydroxide and arylpalladium(II) chloride. These compounds are present in two interconnected catalytic cycles and react with hydrazine and base or hydrazine alone to give the product. The selectivity of the hydroxide complex with hydrazine to form aryl over diaryl hydrazine was lower than that of the chloride complex, as well as the catalytic reaction. In contrast, the selectivity of the chloride complex closely matches that of the catalytic reaction, indicating that the aryl hydrazine is derived from this complex. Kinetic studies show that the coupling process occurs by rate&#8208;limiting deprotonation of a hydrazine&#8208;bound arylpalladium(II) chloride complex to give an arylpalladium(II) hydrazido complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Reactivity of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrazole: Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Click Reaction and Denitrogenative Annulation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: A general catalytic method using Mn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based catalytic system is discovered that enables two different reactions (click reaction and denitrogenative annulation) affording two different classes of nitrogen heterocycles, such as 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles (with a pyridyl motif) and 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;pyridines. Mechanistic investigations suggest that while click reaction likely proceeds through an ionic mechanism, which is different from the traditional click reaction, denitrogenative annulation undergoes likely via an electrophilic metallonitrene intermediate rather than the metalloradical intermediate. Collectively, the discovered method is highly efficient that offer obvious advantages over other methods, as it excludes multi&#8208;step synthesis of these classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic molecules and produces only environmentally benign N2 gas by&#8208;product.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling on Inert Surfaces by Deposition of en Route Generated Aryl Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis of exceptionally stable and p&#8208;conjugated carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bonded nanostructures requires metal surfaces.

      <title>Inducing Strong Valence Band Convergence to Enhance Thermoelectric Performance in PbSe with Two Chemically Independent Knobs</title>
      <dc:description>We present an effective approach to favorably modify the electronic structure of PbSe using Ag doping coupled with SrSe or BaSe alloying. The Ag 4d states make a contribution to in the top of the heavy hole valence band and raise its energy. The Sr and Ba atoms diminish the contribution of Pb 6s  2  states and decrease the energy of the light hole valence band. This electronic structure modification increases the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass, and strongly enhances the thermoelectric performance. Moreover, the Ag&#8208;rich nanoscale precipitates, discordant Ag atoms and Pb/Sr, Pb/Ba point defects in the PbSe matrix work together to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting a record high average  ZT  avg  of ~0.86 over 400&#8208;923 K.</dc:description>

      <title>Formation of Nucleophilic Allylboranes from Molecular Hydrogen and Allenes Catalyzed by a Pyridonate Borane that Displays Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the  in situ  generation of nucleophilic allylboranes from H  2  and allenes mediated by a pyridonate borane that displays frustrated Lewis Pair reactivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations reveal that upon H  2  activation, the covalently bound pyridonate substituent becomes a datively bound pyridone ligand. Dissociation of the formed pyridone borane complex liberates Piers borane and enables a hydroboration of the allene. The allylboranes generated in this way are reactive towards nitriles. A catalytic protocol for the formation of allylboranes from H  2  and allenes and the allylation of nitriles has been devised. This catalytic reaction is a conceptually new way to use molecular H  2  in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we report the  in situ  generation of nucleophilic allylboranes from H  2  and allenes mediated by a pyridonate borane that displays frustrated Lewis Pair reactivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations reveal that upon H  2  activation, the covalently bound pyridonate substituent becomes a datively bound pyridone ligand. Dissociation of the formed pyridone borane complex liberates Piers borane and enables a hydroboration of the allene. The allylboranes generated in this way are reactive towards nitriles. A catalytic protocol for the formation of allylboranes from H  2  and allenes and the allylation of nitriles has been devised. This catalytic reaction is a conceptually new way to use molecular H  2  in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Configurational Entropy Driven High&#8208;Pressure Behaviour of a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show large structural flexibility as a function of temperature or (gas)pressure variation, a fascinating property of high technological and scientific relevance. The targeted design of flexible MOFs demands control over macroscopic thermodynamics as determined by microscopic chemical interactions and remains an open challenge. Here we apply high&#8208;pressure powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the microscopic chemical factors that determine the high&#8208;pressure macroscopic thermodynamics of two flexible pillared&#8208;layer MOFs. For the first time we identify configurational entropy that originates from side chain modifications of the linker as the key factor determining the thermodynamics in a flexible MOF. The study shows that configurational entropy is an important yet largely overlooked parameter, providing an intriguing perspective of how to chemically access the underlying free energy landscape in MOFs.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective and Scalable Synthesis of Sugar Alcohols by Homogeneous Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Unprotected Ketoses</title>
      <dc:description>Sugar alcohols are of great importance to the food industry and are promising building blocks for bio&#8208;based polymers.

      <title>A new route towards green ammonia synthesis through plasma&#8208;driven nitrogen oxidation and catalytic reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Ammonia is an industrial large volume chemical, with its main application in fertilizer production. It also attracts increasing attention as a green energy vector. Over the past century, ammonia production has been dominated by the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, in which a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen gas is converted to ammonia at high temperatures and pressures. Haber&#8208;Bosch processes with natural gas as source of hydrogen are responsible for a significant share of the global CO2  emissions.

In this work, we present the PNOCRA process (Plasma Nitrogen Oxidation and Catalytic Reduction to Ammonia), combining plasma&#8208;assisted nitrogen oxidation and Lean NOx  Trap technology, adopted from diesel engine exhaust gas aftertreatment technology. PNOCRA achieves an energy requirement of 4.6 MJ/mol NH3, which is an over 4&#8208;fold energy reduction compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plasma&#8208;enabled ammonia synthesis from N2  and H2  with reasonable yield (&gt;1%).</dc:description>

      <title>Evaporation Induced Spontaneous Micro&#8208;Vortexes via Engineering Marangoni Flow</title>
      <dc:description>Vortex flow field is widely used to manipulate objects at microscale in the microfluidics. Previous approaches to produce the vortex flow field mainly focused on inertia flows. It remains a challenge to create vortexes in Stokes flow regime. Here we reported an evaporation induced spontaneous vortex flow system in Stokes flow regime by engineering Marangoni flow in a micro&#8208;structured microfluidic chip.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vortex flow field is widely used to manipulate objects at microscale in the microfluidics. Previous approaches to produce the vortex flow field mainly focused on inertia flows. It remains a challenge to create vortexes in Stokes flow regime. Here we reported an evaporation induced spontaneous vortex flow system in Stokes flow regime by engineering Marangoni flow in a micro&#8208;structured microfluidic chip. The Marangoni flow is created by nonuniform evaporation of surfactant solution. Various vortexes are constructed by folding the air&#8208;water interface via microstructures. Patterns of vortexes are programmable by designing the geometry of the microstructures, and are predictable using numerical simulations. Moreover, rotation of micro&#8208;objects and enrichment of micro&#8208;particles using vortex flow is demonstrated. This approach to create vortexes will provide a promising platform for various microfluidic applications such as biological analysis, chemical synthesis, and nanomaterial assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Photochemical in&#8208;situ Exfoliation of Metal&#8210;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>

The performance differences and photocatalytic mechanisms have been studied with theoretical calculations and photoelectric experiments.

      <title>Investigating drug permeation across a lipid membrane supported on mesoporous silica</title>
      <dc:description>There is an urgent demand for analytic approaches that enable quick, precise and representative quantification of transport of small biologically active chemical compounds across cellular membranes. In this study, we established a new means to monitor membrane permeation kinetics, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy strictly confined to a ~500 nm thick silica mesoporous substrate, positioned underneath a planar supported cell membrane mimic. This way, we demonstrate spatiotemporally resolved membrane&#8208;permeation kinetics of a small molecule model drug, felodipine, while simultaneously being able to control the integrity of, and follow drug binding to, the cell membrane mimic. By contrasting the permeation behaviour of pure felodipine with felodipine coupled to the permeability enhancer caprylate (C8), we provide evidence for C8&#8208;facilitated transport across lipid membranes, thus validating the potential for this approach to successfully quantify carrier system&#8208;induced changes to cellular membrane permeation while simultaneously controlling membrane integrity.</dc:description>

      <title>From Sergeants and Soldiers to Chiral Conflict Effects in Helical Polymers by Acting on the Conformational Composition of the Comonomers</title>
      <dc:description>Different communication mechanisms can be switched within a copolymer by acting on the conformational composition of the components and their chirality. Thus, a Sergeant and Soldiers effect is produced in two diastereomeric copolymer series &#8212;poly[(  S  )&#8208;  1  r  &#8208;  co  &#8208;(  S  )&#8208;  2  (  1&#8208;r  )  ] and poly[(  R  )&#8208;  1&#160;r  &#8208;  co  &#8208;(  S  )&#8208;  2  (  1&#8208;r  )  ]&#8212; due to the presence in chloroform of a preferred conformation in (  S  )&#8208;  2  , and a conformational equilibrium in  1  , where a  P  helix is induced independently of the absolute configuration of the Soldier. In THF, the presence of a conformational equilibrium at the pendants of the two components produces a reciprocal chiral enhancement effect by copolymerization of the two monomers, while in DMF, a third chiral to chiral communication switch is produced due to the presence of a single conformer at the pendant group of the two components. In such case, a Chiral Conflict or Chiral Accord effect is produced depending if the two components induce the same or the opposite helical sense.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates in nature contain two unpaired electrons in the Fe&#8211;O antibonding orbitals, which are thought to contribute to their high reactivity. To challenge this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized closed&#8208;shell singlet iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(quinisox)Fe(O)]  +  (  1  +  ;  quinisox&#8208;H  = (  N  &#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;isoxazoline&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenyl)quinoline&#8208;8&#8208;carboxamide). We identified the quinisox ligand by DFT computational screening out of over 450 candidates. Following the ligand synthesis, we detected  1  +  in the gas phase and confirmed its spin state by visible and infrared photodissociation spectroscopy (IRPD). The Fe&#8211;O stretching frequency in  1  +  is 960.5 cm  &#8208;1  , consistent with Fe&#8211;O triple&#8208;bond, which was also confirmed by multireference calculations. The unprecedented bond strength is accompanied by high gas&#8208;phase reactivity of  1  +  in oxygen atom transfer and in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. This challenges the current view of the spin&#8208;state driven reactivity of the Fe&#8211;O complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacial Polymerization: From Chemistry to Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of functional polymer materials has benefitted greatly from interfacial polymerization, and is still a dynamic area. This Review highlights the developments, latest progress, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with interfacial polymerization.







Abstract
Interfacial polymerization, where a chemical reaction is confined at the liquid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;air interface, exhibits a strong advantage for the controllable fabrication of films, capsules, and fibers for use as separation membranes and electrode materials. Recent developments in technology and polymer chemistry have brought new vigor to interfacial polymerization. Here, we consider the history of interfacial polymerization in terms of the polymerization types: interfacial polycondensation, interfacial polyaddition, interfacial oxidative polymerization, interfacial polycoordination, interfacial supramolecular polymerization, and some others. The accordingly emerging functional materials are highlighted, as well as the challenges and opportunities brought by new technologies for interfacial polymerization. Interfacial polymerization will no doubt keep on developing and producing a series of fascinating functional materials.

      <title>Build&#8208;up of Cationic Azahelicenes via Regioselective Three&#8208;Component Annulation Using in Situ Activation Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Described herein is a build&#8208;up strategy of cationic azahelicenes through the three&#8208;component annulation reaction of isoquinoline, indole and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE), in which DCE serves as in situ activating agent for C1&#8722;H activation of isoquinoline, vinyl equivalent and solvent. This in situ activation annulation reaction features a facile one&#8208;step synthesis and complete regioselectivity. The complete regioselectivity of C1 over C3 for the isoquinoline ring paves a path to the helical structure in a highly ordered sequence. As a representative example, the ionic [5]azahelicenium fluorophore 3h exhibits the potential as a mitochondria&#8208;targeted biomarker with good photostability and low cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

Through tailoring outer shell electron configurations of Sr (II) and Co (II) cations, intensity of the fluorescence emission of the MOFs is tuned from high emission to complete non&#8208;emission.  Furthermore,  Sr&#8208;ETTB with strong blue luminescence shows reversible fluorescence emission variations  in response to pressure and temperature, which is directly related to the reversible deformation of the crystal structure. In addition, non&#8208;emissive Co&#8208;ETTB counterpart exhibits a turn&#8208;on fluorescent enhancement under the stimulation of analyte histidine.

      <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of O&#8208;Heteroacenes via Ladderization of Fluorinated Oligophenylenes</title>
      <dc:description>We report a novel catalyst&#8208;free approach to benzoannulated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles from fluorinated oligophenylenes. Unlike other existing methods, the presented reaction does not require oxygen&#8208;containing precursor and relies on outer oxygen source i.e. potassium  tert  &#8208;butoxide, which serves as an O  2&#8208;  synthon. The radical nature of the reaction facilitates nucleophilic substitution even in the presence of strong electron&#8208;donating groups and enables de&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation required for the complete annulation. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to introduce five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings containing oxygen, whereas multiple annulations also open up a short synthetic path to ladder&#8208;type O&#8208;heteroacenes and oligodibenzofurans.</dc:description>

      <title>Genomics&#8208;driven discovery of a novel glutarimide antibiotic from Burkholderia gladioli reveals an unusual polyketide synthase chain release mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>A gene cluster encoding a cryptic  trans  &#8208;acyl transferase polyketide synthase (PKS) was identified in the genomes of  Burkholderia gladioli  BCC0238 and BCC1622, both isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Bioinfomatics analyses indicated the PKS assembles a novel member of the glutarimide class of antibiotics, hitherto only isolated from  Streptomyces  species. Screening of a range of growth parameters enabled gladiostatin, the metabolic product of the PKS, to be identified. NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed that gladiostatin, which has promising activity against several human cancer cell lines and inhibits tumor cell migration, contains an unusual 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylbutenolide in addition to the glutarimide pharmacophore. An AfsA&#8208;like domain at the C&#8208;terminus of the PKS was shown to catalyze condensation of 3&#8208;ketothioesters with dihydroxyacetone phosphate, indicating it plays a key role in polyketide chain release and butenolide formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanomotors Sense Local Physicochemical Heterogeneities in Tumor Microenvironments</title>
      <dc:description>The invasion of cancer is brought about by continuous interaction of malignant cells with their surrounding tissue microenvironment. Investigating the remodeling of local extracellular matrix (ECM) by invading cells can therefore provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of cancer progression. In this paper, we use an active and untethered nanomechanical tool, realized as magnetically driven nanomotors, to locally probe a 3D tissue culture microenvironment. We made the surprising observation that nanomotors preferentially adhere to the ECM near cancer cells and magnitude of the adhesive force increased with cell lines of higher metastatic ability. We hypothesized and experimentally confirmed that sialic acid linkage specific to cancer&#8208;secreted ECM makes it differently charged, which determines this adhesive behavior. In an assay consisting of both cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous epithelia, designed to mimic the in vivo histopathological milieu of a malignant breast tumor, we find the nanomotors to preferentially decorate the region around the cancer cells. The findings reported here can lead to promising applications in cancer diagnosis and imaging, quantification of cancer aggression and in vivo drug delivery applications. They also establish the tremendous potential of magnetic nanomotors for fundamental studies of cancer mechanobiology.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of CO Electrooxidation on Pt(hkl) Single Crystal Surfaces in Acidic Solution</title>
      <dc:description>The adsorption and electrooxidation of CO molecules at well&#8208;defined Pt(  hkl  ) single crystal electrode surfaces is a key step towards addressing catalyst poisoning mechanisms in fuel cells. Herein, we employed  in situ  electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) coupled with theoretical calculation to investigate CO electrooxidation on Pt(  hkl  ) surfaces in acidic solution. We successfully obtained the Raman signal of top and bridge site adsorbed CO* molecules on Pt(111) and Pt(100). In contrast, on Pt(110) surfaces only top site adsorbed CO* was observed during the entire electrooxidation process. Direct spectroscopic evidence for OH* and COOH* species forming on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces was afforded and confirmed subsequently via isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations. In summary, the formation and adsorption of OH* and COOH* species plays a vital role in expediting the electrooxidation process, which relates with the pre&#8208;oxidation peak of CO electrooxidation. This work deepens knowledge of the CO electrooxidation process and provides new perspectives for the design of anti&#8208;poisoning and highly effective catalysts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Porous graphene has shown promise as a new generation of selective membrane for sieving atoms, ions and molecules.

      <title>A General Strategy for Development of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probes for in vivo High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic&#8208;dye based NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes, owing to their high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deeper penetration, are highly useful for deep&#8208;tissue high&#8208;contrast imaging in vivo. However, due to the lack of suitable dyes, it is still a challenge to design activatable NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes. In this work, we have designed a novel class of polymethine dyes (NIRII&#8208;RTs) with bright (quantum yield up to 2.03%), stable and anti&#8208;solvent quenching NIR&#8208;II emission, together with large Stokes shifts. Significantly, unlike most of reported NIR&#8208;II fluorophores which show uncontrollable fluorescence, the novel NIR&#8208;II dyes NIRII&#8208;RT3 and NIRII&#8208;RT4 equipped with the functional carboxylic&#8208;acid group could serve as effective NIR&#8208;II platforms for the design of activatable bioimaging probe with high contrast. As a proof of concept, we synthesized a series of target&#8208;activatable NIRII&#8208;RT probes (NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;pH, NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;ATP &amp; NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;Hg) for pH, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and metal ion detecting.

      <dc:description>The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV&#8208;1 gp41 contains epitopes for at least four broadly neutralizing antibodies. Depending on solution conditions and construct design, different structures have been reported for this segment. We show that in aqueous solution the MPER fragment (gp160  660&#8208;674  ) exists in a monomer&#8208;trimer equilibrium with an association constant in the micro&#8208;molar range. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the association is exothermic, more favorable in D  2  O than H  2  O, and increases with ionic strength, indicating hydrophobically driven intermolecular interactions. Circular dichroism,  13  C  &#945;  chemical shifts, NOE, and hydrogen exchange rates reveal that MPER undergoes a structural transition from predominately unfolded monomer at low concentrations to an &#945;&#8208;helical trimer at high concentrations.

      <dc:description>The glycan structures of the receptor binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV2 spike glycoprotein expressed in human&#160;HEK293F cells&#160;have been studied by using NMR.

      <title>CO binding to the FeV Cofactor of CO&#8208;reducing Vanadium Nitrogenase at Atomic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogenases reduce N  2  , the most abundant element in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere that is otherwise resistant to chemical conversions due to its stable triple bond. Vanadium nitrogenase stands out in that it additionally processes carbon monoxide, a known inhibitor of the more prominent molybdenum nitrogenase. The reduction of CO leads to the formation of hydrocarbon products, holding the potential for biotechnological applications in analogy to the industrial Fischer&#8208;Tropsch process. Here we report the most highly resolved structure of vanadium nitrogenase to date at 1.0 &#197; resolution, with CO bound to the active site cofactor after catalytic turnover. CO bridges iron ions Fe2 and Fe6, replacing sulfide S2B, in a binding mode that is in line with previous reports on the CO complex of molybdenum nitrogenase. We discuss the structural consequences of continued turnover when CO is removed, which involve the replacement of CO possibly by OH  &#8211;  , the movement of Q176  D  and K391  D  , the return of sulfide and the emergence of two additional water molecules that are absent in the CO&#8208;bound state.</dc:description>

By equipping the different polymers with photopolymerizable groups and varying cross&#8208;linking rates, we have been able to kinetically control and capture the spatial organisation in a variety of compartmentalized macroscopic structures without the need of creating barrier layers.

Abstract
Triflic anhydride mediated activation of acetophenones leads to highly electrophilic intermediates that can undergo a variety of transformations when treated with nucleophiles. This electrophilic ketone activation gives access to &#945;&#8208;arylated and &#945;&#8208;oxyaminated acetophenones under metal&#8208;free conditions in moderate to excellent yields and enables extension to the synthesis of arylated morpholines via generation of vinylsulfonium salts. Computational investigations confirmed the transient existence of intermediates derived from vinyl triflates and the role of the oxygen atoms at the para position of aromatic ring in facilitating their stabilisation.

      <title>Supercritical Water is not Hydrogen Bonded</title>
      <dc:description>
Supercritical water possesses vastly different properties compared to its liquid phase, for instance it is well known that the famous tetrahedral H&#8208;bond network is destroyed. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009640), P. Schienbein and D.

      <title>Tumor Microenvironment Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Imaging and Synergistic Cancer Therapy by Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8211;Cu2+ Nanoassemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME) stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence imaging and trimodal synergistic cancer treatment nanoplatform is facilely constructed via assembling carbon dots and Cu2+. This could act as a potential strategy to achieve enhanced cancer therapeutic efficiency with minimized side effects.







Abstract
A method is developed to fabricate tumor microenvironment (TME) stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatform for fluorescence (FL) imaging and synergistic cancer therapy via assembling photosensitizer (chlorine e6, Ce6) modified carbon dots (CDs&#8208;Ce6) and Cu2+. The as&#8208;obtained nanoassemblies (named Cu/CC nanoparticles, NPs) exhibit quenched FL and photosensitization due to the aggregation of CDs&#8208;Ce6. Their FL imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) functions are recovered efficiently once they entering tumor sites by the stimulation of TME. Introducing of Cu2+ not only provides extra chemodynamic therapy (CDT) function through reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but also depletes GSH in tumors by a redox reaction, thus amplifying the intracellular oxidative stress and enhancing the efficacy of reactive oxygen species (ROS) based therapy. Cu/CC NPs can act as a FL imaging guided trimodal synergistic cancer treatment agent by photothermal therapy (PTT), PDT, and thermally amplified CDT.

      <title>Host Differential Sensitization toward Color/Lifetime&#8208;Tuned Lanthanide Coordination Polymers for Optical Multiplexing</title>
      <dc:description>Optical multiplexing based on luminescent materials with tunable color/lifetime holds potential applications in information storage and security. However, the available tunable luminescent materials reported so far still suffer from several drawbacks of low efficiency or poor stability, thus restraining their further applications. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to develop the efficient and stable lanthanide coordination polymers (LCPs) with tunable luminescence as a new option for optical multiplexing. Their multicolor emission from green to red and naked&#8208;eye&#8208;sensitive green emission with tunable lifetime (from ~ 300 to ~ 600 &#956;s) can be controlled by host differential sensitization and energy transfer between lanthanide ions. The quantum efficiencies of developed samples range from ~ 20% to ~ 46% and the luminescence intensity/lifetime appear quite stable in polar solvents up to ten weeks. Furthermore, with the aids of inkjet printing and concepts of luminescence lifetime imaging and time&#8208;gated imaging, we also illustrate their inspiring and promising applications of information storage and security in spatial and temporal domains. These results will open up an avenue to the efficient and stable LCPs with tunable luminescence toward optical multiplexing applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optical multiplexing based on luminescent materials with tunable color/lifetime holds potential applications in information storage and security. However, the available tunable luminescent materials reported so far still suffer from several drawbacks of low efficiency or poor stability, thus restraining their further applications. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to develop the efficient and stable lanthanide coordination polymers (LCPs) with tunable luminescence as a new option for optical multiplexing. Their multicolor emission from green to red and naked&#8208;eye&#8208;sensitive green emission with tunable lifetime (from ~ 300 to ~ 600 &#956;s) can be controlled by host differential sensitization and energy transfer between lanthanide ions. The quantum efficiencies of developed samples range from ~ 20% to ~ 46% and the luminescence intensity/lifetime appear quite stable in polar solvents up to ten weeks. Furthermore, with the aids of inkjet printing and concepts of luminescence lifetime imaging and time&#8208;gated imaging, we also illustrate their inspiring and promising applications of information storage and security in spatial and temporal domains. These results will open up an avenue to the efficient and stable LCPs with tunable luminescence toward optical multiplexing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production Trilogy</title>
      <dc:description>H  2  production via water electrolysis is of great significance in clean energy pruduction, which, however, suffers from the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the anode product, O  2  , which is of rather low value, may lead to the dangerous explosion hazard and the generation of membrane&#8208;degradable reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address aforementioned issues of electrocatalytic H  2  production, the most recent advances are summarized in three stages based on the benefit increments and varied electron donation routes, which are: (1) electron donations by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H  2  production; (2) electron donations by sacrificing agent oxidation: using sacrificial agents to assist H  2  production; (3) electron donations by electro&#8208;synthesis reaction: achieving electro&#8208;synthesis&#160;in parallel with cathodic H  2  production. We will mainly focus on various anodic reactions and corresponding electro&#8208;catalysts in different operating media, as well as the system establishments in this review. The present challenges and related prospects will also be discussed, hopefully to benefit the further progresses of electrocatalytic H  2  production in the future.</dc:description>

      <title>Frustrated Lewis Pairs Comprising Nitrogen Lewis Acids for Si&#8208;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic nitrogen Lewis acids are a recent addition to the field of organic chemistry. Based on nitrenium cations, these acids where previously shown to generate Lewis adducts when combined with the appropriate Lewis bases. In this article, a triazinium&#8208;based Lewis acid was combined with  t  Bu  3  P to generate a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) capable of cleaving, for the first time, Si&#8208;H bonds in silanes. Whereas low yields were initially encountered due to insufficient Lewis acidity, a new nitrenium&#8208;based Lewis acid was synthesized, and its superior Lewis acidity was experimentally and computationally confirmed. A FLP based on this acid cleaved the Si&#8208;H bond in PhSiH  3  , generating the triazane product in a quantitative yield. This unprecedented N&#8208;H triazane was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR techniques and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Representing a new class of compounds, N&#8208;H triazanes display the potential capacity to participate in hydride transfer reactions.</dc:description>

We observe two dynamical modes for the helix.

      <title>Bonding Energetics of Palladium&#8208;amido/aryloxide Complexes in DMSO: Implications for Pd&#8208;mediated Aniline Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Thermodynamic knowledge of the metal&#8210;ligand (M&#8210;L) &#963;&#8208;bond strength is crucial to understanding metal&#8208;mediated transformations, but it is rarely presented in literature. Here, we developed a general methodology for determining the Pd&#8210;X (X = OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X)) in DMSO taking [(tmeda)PdArX] (tmeda = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) as the model complexes. The first &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) scales here derived span a range of 2.6&#8210;9.0 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;O)s and of 14.5&#8210;19.5 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;N)s, respectively, implying a facile heterolytic detachment of the Pd&#8210;ligands. Structure&#8208;reactivity analyses of a modeling Pd&#8208;mediated X&#8210;H bond activation reveal that the M&#8210;X bond metathesis is basically dominated by the differences of the X&#8210;H and Pd&#8210;X bond strengths, with the former being more influential. Combinatorial application of the &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) and pKa(X&#8210;H) parameters enables rational regulations of the reaction thermodynamics and chemo&#8208;selectivity, and hence provides a feasible energetic criterion for diagnosing the probability of aniline activation with Pd&#8210;X complexes.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thermodynamic knowledge of the metal&#8210;ligand (M&#8210;L) &#963;&#8208;bond strength is crucial to understanding metal&#8208;mediated transformations, but it is rarely presented in literature. Here, we developed a general methodology for determining the Pd&#8210;X (X = OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X)) in DMSO taking [(tmeda)PdArX] (tmeda = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) as the model complexes. The first &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) scales here derived span a range of 2.6&#8210;9.0 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;O)s and of 14.5&#8210;19.5 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;N)s, respectively, implying a facile heterolytic detachment of the Pd&#8210;ligands. Structure&#8208;reactivity analyses of a modeling Pd&#8208;mediated X&#8210;H bond activation reveal that the M&#8210;X bond metathesis is basically dominated by the differences of the X&#8210;H and Pd&#8210;X bond strengths, with the former being more influential. Combinatorial application of the &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) and pKa(X&#8210;H) parameters enables rational regulations of the reaction thermodynamics and chemo&#8208;selectivity, and hence provides a feasible energetic criterion for diagnosing the probability of aniline activation with Pd&#8210;X complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we reported a highly emissive organic crystal combining with ultralow temperature elasticity and self&#8208;waveguide (when a crystal is excited, it emits light from itself and travels through the crystal to the other end) based on a simple single&#8208;benzene emitter. This crystal displayed excellent elastic bending ability in liquid nitrogen (LN).

      <title>Broadband Dynamics of Ubiquitin by Anionic and Cationic Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted NMR Spin Relaxation</title>
      <dc:description>The quantitative and comprehensive description of the internal dynamics of proteins is critical for understanding their function. Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted  15  N NMR spin relaxation is a new method that uses a simple read&#8208;out allowing the observation of ps &#8208; &#956;s dynamics of proteins when transiently interacting with the surface of nanoparticles. The method is applied here to the widely studied protein human ubiquitin in the presence of anionic and cationic silica nanoparticles (SNP) of different size. The resulting backbone dynamics profiles are highly reproducible and strikingly similar to each other, indicating that, with the exception of the disordered tail, specific protein&#8208;SNP interactions are unimportant. The dynamics profiles closely match the sub&#8208;ns dynamics S  2  values observed by model&#8208;free analysis of standard  15  N relaxation of ubiquitin in free solution. These results indicate that the bulk of ubiquitin backbone dynamics in solution is confined to sub&#8208;ns timescales and, hence, it is dynamically considerably more restrained than some previous NMR studies have suggested.</dc:description>

Artificial Water Channels biomimicking natural AQPs, can be used for both selective and fast transport of water.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay Enabling Modular Synthesis of Fused Pyridines from Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Oximes and Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>We have rationally designed a new class of alkyne&#8208;tethered oximes, and applied them into an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed radical relay protocol for the rapid assembly of a wide array of structurally new and interesting fused pyridines. This method showcases broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and can be applied for a few biologically active molecules. In addition, the fused pyridines can be diversely functionalized through various simple transformations, such as cyclization, C&#8208;H alkylation, and click reaction. DFT calculation studies indicate that the reactions involve cascade 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig radical addition, and cyclization processes. Moreover, preliminary biological investigations suggest that some of the fused pyridines exhibit good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity by restoring the imbalance of inflammatory homeostasis of macrophages in a lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced model.</dc:description>

      <title>Intrinsic Apyrase&#8208;Like Activity of Cerium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Dephosphorylation of Adenosine Tri&#8208; and Diphosphate</title>
      <dc:description>Apyrase represents an important family of extracellular enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds (HEPBs) in ATP and ADP, thereby modulating many physiological processes and driving life activities. Here, we report an unexpected discovery that cerium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) of UiO&#8208;66(Ce) possess intrinsic apyrase&#8208;like activity for the intervention of ATP/ADP&#8208;related physiological processes. The abundant Ce(III)/Ce(IV) couple sites of Ce&#8208;MOFs endow them with the ability to selectively catalyse the hydrolysis of HEPBs of ATP and ADP under physiological condition. Compared to natural enzymes, they could resist to extreme pH and temperature, and present a broad range of working conditions. Based on this finding, a significant inhibitory effect on ADP&#8208;induced platelet aggregation was observed upon exposing the platelet&#8208;rich plasma (PRP) to the biomimetic UiO&#8208;66(Ce) films, prefiguring their wide application potentials in medicine and biotechnology.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Mechanisms of Layered Lithium&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Layered lithium&#8208;rich materials are promising cathode materials for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Understanding the principles of the performance degradation mechanisms is a prerequisite for progress in this area. In this Minireview, recent research on the material structure and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials is discussed.







Abstract
Layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interest owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320&#8211;350&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, interest in layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials is expected to revive in answer to our increasing dependence on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we review recent research progress and in&#8208;depth descriptions of the structure characterization and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarize the proposed reaction mechanisms of both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges facing the future development of lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

In particular, we comprehensively summarize the proposed reaction mechanisms of both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges facing the future development of lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Considerations for a More Accurate Evaluation Method for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
For the comparison of photocatalysts for water splitting, more comprehensive and accurate evaluation indicators are needed. Suggestions are made in this Viewpoint, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.







Abstract
Over the past decades, various photocatalysts have been developed and great progress has been achieved in the field of solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting. However, the lack of an accurate and comprehensive evaluation method greatly hinders the meaningful comparison between different systems and becomes a serious impediment for the development of photocatalysts. Although many researchers are aware of this, there has been little work in this area. In this Viewpoint, we first analyze the insufficiencies of the existing evaluation methods and then make preliminary suggestions, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.
