         <title>Programmed synthesis of Hepta&#8208;differentiated &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: 1 out of 117655 arrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclodextrin poly&#8208;functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications&#8230; However, the regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on b&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. Here, we uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, expanding the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using DIBAL&#8208;H promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized b&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Engineering of Single&#8208;Molecule Stereoelectronic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transport in a single&#8208;molecule junction is extraordinarily sensitive to both the internal electronic structure of molecule and its microscopic environment. Two distinct conductance states of a prototype terphenyl molecule are observed, corresponding to the bistability of outer phenyl rings at each end. An azobenzene unit is intentionally introduced through atomically precise side&#8208;functionalization at the central ring of the terphenyl, which is reversibly isomerized between trans and cis forms by either electric or optical stimuli. Both experiment and theory demonstrate that the azobenzene side&#8208;group delicately modulates charge transport in the backbone via single&#8208;molecule stereoelectronic effect. We reveal that the dihedral angle between the central and outer phenyl ring, as well as the corresponding rotation barrier, is subtly controlled by isomerization, while the behaviors of the phenyl ring away from the azobenzene are hardly affected. This tunability offers a new route to precisely engineer multiconfigurational single&#8208;molecule memories, switches, and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;induced surface metallization for ammonia synthesis under photoexcitation up to 1550 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of electronic states at the semiconductor surface/interface is of great importance in catalysis, microelectronics, and energy conversion. Herein, we report that the first observation of surface metallization of TiO  2&#8208;x  induced by fluoride ions. The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F  &#8208;  and adjacent Ti  3+  . The metalized TiO  2&#8208;x  with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200&#8208;1550 nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H  2  and N  2  by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Bioavailaibity of Hydrophobic Prodrugs through Supramolecular Nanocarriers based on Recombinant Proteins for Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular nanodrug assembly originated from supramolecular chemistry is becoming a powerful strategy for medication. The potential of engineered proteins as building blocks for nanoformulation is rarely investigated. Here, we developed a new generation of recombinant protein&#8208;based nanodrug carrier, which is very efficient for loading and delivering hydrophobic prodrug aldoxorubicin. Significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma (OS) models were observed. Half&#8208;life of the nanodrug reached almost two days and the corresponding bioavailability had 17&#8208;fold increase. This is significantly superior to other counterpart, empowering long&#8208;acting OS treatment scenarios. Importantly, off&#8208;target side effects of the prodrug including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis were greatly mitigated with our medication. Thus, our assembly strategy potently enables customized designs of advanced nanodelivery systems employing broader biomaterial building blocks for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ge/Carbon Atomic&#8208;Scale Hybrid Anode Material: A New&#8208;Type Micro&#8208;Nano Gradient Porous Structure with High Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous growth of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and  material crushing are the fundamental reasons that hinder the application of Ge anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The conventional carbon coating modification methods are challenging to solve Ge deformation crushing during discharge/charge cycles. Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500 &#8451;), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity is maintained at 1127 mAh g&#8208;1  after 1000 cycles (2 A g&#8208;1  (2&#8208;71 cycles), 4 A g&#8208;1  (72&#8208;1000 cycles)) with a retention of 84% compared to the second cycle. The thickness of the SEI is only 17.4 nm after 1000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance and stable SEI fully reflect the application potential of this material.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Rapid Positioning of Hierarchical Assemblies of Conjugated Polymers via Meniscus&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to rapidly and deliberately pattern nanomaterials of interest over a large area provides an effective route for device manufacturing. Herein, we report the meniscus&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly (MASA)&#8208;enabled rapid positioning of hierarchically assembled dots and stripes composed of luminescent conjugated polymer over two length scales. Specifically, periodically arranged conjugated polymer (poly(9, 9&#8208;dioctylfluorenes); PFOs) dots, punch&#8208;holes and stripes are yielded at microscopic scale via MASA in conjunction with concurrent self&#8208;assembly of PFOs into two&#8208;dimensional lenticular crystals within each dot, punch&#8208;hole and stripe at nanoscopic scale. Such hierarchical assembly is rendered by constraining the evaporation of PFOs solution in a two&#8208;nearly&#8208;parallel&#8208;plate geometry via MASA process. More intriguingly, through manipulating the three&#8208;phase contact line (TCL) of liquid meniscus of PFOs by employing judiciously designed upper plate, the assembly of PFOs is directed by such predefined TCL, yielding an array of curved stripes. Clearly, such rapid creation of hierarchical assemblies via MASA opens up possibilities for large&#8208;scale organization of a wide range of soft matters and nanomaterials in a simple and controllable manner for use in optics, optoelectronics, biosensors, catalysis, etc.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex coacervation enables important wet adhesion processes in natural and artificial systems. However, existed synthetic coacervate adhesives show limited wet adhesion properties, non&#8208;thermoresponsiveness, and inferior biodegradability, greatly hampering their translations. Herein, by harnessing supramolecular assembly and rational protein design, we present a temperature&#8208;sensitive wet bioadhesive fabricated through recombinant protein and surfactant. Mechanical performance of the bioglue system is actively tunable with thermal triggers. In cold condition, adhesion strength of the bioadhesive was only ~50 kPa. By increasing temperature, the strength presented up to 600 kPa, which is remarkably stronger than other biological counterparts. This is probably due to the thermally triggered phase transition of the engineered protein and the formation of coacervate, thus leading to the enhanced wet adhesion bonding. This strategy holds great promise for the fabrication of smart biomaterials such as new generation of thermo&#8208;responsive patches for healthcare applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Strategies for Carbon&#8208;Halogen Bond Formation Using Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel catalysis has demonstrated the capability of performing a broad range of synthetically challenging transformations over the last decade. Though recent literature has focused on the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bonds, a variety of breakthroughs in the field of C&#8211;X bond generation have also been reported. A diverse range of strategies using nickel have been developed in an effort to expand the scope and synthetic utility of these halogenation methods. This review will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C&#8211;X reductive elimination, triflate&#8208;to&#8208;halogen exchange reactions, directed C&#8211;H halogenation, non&#8208;directed electrophilic C&#8211;H halogenation of arenes, enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination of carbonyl containing compounds, and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization&#8208;halogenation reactions. The final section has been split into 2 parts: nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrohalogenation and nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbohalogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Impact of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2&#180;&#8208;azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {Ru  II  (acac)  2  } (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedionato).

         <title>Highly Curved Nanostructures Coated Co, N&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen doped graphene could catalyze the electrochemical reduction and evolution of oxygen, but unfortunately suffers from sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, for the first time, we report an onion&#8208;like carbon coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material, which possesses multilayers of highly curved nanostructures that form mesoporous architectures. These unique nanospheres are produced, when surfactant micelles are introduced to synthesis precursors. Owing to the combined electronic effect and nanostructuring effect, our OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C materials exhibit high bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity, showing a promising application in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Experimental results are rationalized by theoretical calculations, showing that the curvature of graphitic carbon plays a vital role in promoting activities of meta&#8208;carbon atoms near graphitic N and ortho/meta carbon atoms close to pyridinic N.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Optical Activity and Second Harmonic Generation in 2D Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2D hybrid metal halides ((R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4) were synthesized, and their optical activity was investigated. The materials exhibited a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor of up to about 0.06 and efficient second harmonic generation (see picture). Calculations demonstrated that their giant optical activity is induced by the high joint density of states. Hence, the chiral (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4 films should be suitable for use in chiral and nonlinear photonic devices.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides enables the extension of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics. By using chiral (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA) as the organic component, we synthesized chiral hybrid copper halides, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4, and investigated their optical activity. Thin films of this material showed a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor as high as approximately 0.06. We discuss the origin of the giant optical activity observed in (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4 by theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples. Our study provides insight into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, creating a new platform for chiral and nonlinear photonic device applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides: On the Way to Pure C5 Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported for the first time is an unusual borane&#8208;initiated polymerization of arsonium ylide monomers, where the main&#8208;chain grows by five carbon atoms, from the monomer, at a time and leads to unique structures.







Abstract
The first C5 polymerization is reported, where the main&#8208;chain is growing by five carbon atoms of the monomer at a time. Three dienyltriphenylarsonium ylide monomers were synthesized and polymerized with triethylborane as an initiator, leading to random terpolymers (C1, C3, C5) with mainly C5 repeating units (up to 84.1&#8201;%). It has been found that the methyl group (electron&#8208;donating substituent) on the conjugated double bond of the ylides facilitates the formation of C5 segments. A mechanism was proposed based on NMR characterization and DFT calculations. The high C5 content ensures that things are on the right track for pure C5 homopolymerization.

         <title>Effect of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Database Selection on the Assessment of Gas Storage and Separation Potentials of MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We examined thousands of common materials in two widely used computation&#8208;ready metal&#8211;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.







Abstract
Development of computation&#8208;ready metal&#8211;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) has accelerated high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) of materials to identify the best candidates for gas storage and separation. These DBs were constructed using structural curations to make MOFs directly usable for molecular simulations, which caused the same MOF to be reported with different structural features in different DBs. We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Results showed that DB selection has a significant effect on the calculated gas uptakes and ideal selectivities of materials at low pressure. A detailed analysis on the curated structures was provided to isolate the critical elements of MOFs determining the gas uptakes. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.

         <title>Observation of Carbonic Acid Formation from Interaction between Carbon Dioxide and Ice by Using In Situ Modulation Excitation IR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that carbonic acid (H2CO3) can be formed from CO2 and H2O on an ice surface without neither high energy irradiation nor protonation of bicarbonate or carbonate by strong acids. This was possible by using in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy.







Abstract
Carbonic acid, H2CO3, is of fundamental importance in nature both in living and non&#8208;living systems. Providing direct spectroscopic evidence for carbonic acid formation is however a challenge. Here we provide clear evidence by in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection IR spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy and phase&#8208;sensitive detection that CO2 adsorption on ice surfaces is accompanied by carbonic acid formation. We demonstrate that carbonic acid can be formed from CO2 on ice in the absence of high&#8208;energy irradiation and without protonation by strong acids. The formation of carbonic acid is favored at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it rapidly dissociates to form bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) and carbonate (CO32&#8722;). The direct formation of carbonic acid from adsorption of CO2 on ice could play a role in the upper troposphere in cirrus clouds, where all the necessary ingredients to form carbonic acid, that is, low temperature, CO2 gas, and ice, are present.

         <title>Mixed Noble&#8208;Gas Compounds of Krypton(II) and Xenon(VI); [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KrF2 and [XeF5][AsF6] react in anhydrous HF to form [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6]. The complexes were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The KrF2 ligands interact with xenon(VI) through Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;FKrF secondary bonds that are shown by computational studies to be noncovalent, electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The complexes provide unique examples of mixed noble&#8208;gas compounds.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of KrF2 has been limited in contrast with that of XeF2, which exhibits a far richer coordination chemistry with main&#8208;group and transition&#8208;metal cations. In the present work, reactions of [XeF5][AsF6] with KrF2 in anhydrous HF solvent afforded [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6], the first mixed krypton/xenon compounds. X&#8208;ray crystal structures and Raman spectra show the KrF2 ligands and [AsF6]&#8722; anions are F&#8208;coordinated to the xenon atoms of the [XeF5]+ cations. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are consistent with essentially noncovalent ligand&#8722;xenon bonds that may be described in terms of &#963;&#8208;hole bonding. These complexes significantly extend the XeF2&#8211;KrF2 analogy and the limited chemistry of krypton by introducing a new class of coordination compound in which KrF2 functions as a ligand that coordinates to xenon(VI). The HF solvates, [F5Xe(FH)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FH)SbF6], are also characterized in this study and they provide rare examples of HF coordinated to xenon(VI).

         <title>Highly Enantioselective CuAAC of Functional Tertiary Alcohols Featuring an Ethynyl Group and Their Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of multifunctional tertiary alcohols featuring an &#945;&#8208;ethynyl or &#945;&#8208;triazole moiety is described via enantioselective CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of tertiary alcohols in the presence of phosphonate&#8208;functionalized pyridinebisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands. The method achieves kinetic resolution of racemates with a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.







Abstract
The first highly enantioselective CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of tertiary alcohols and their kinetic resolution is reported. This approach allows facile access to multifunctional tertiary alcohols featuring an &#945;&#8208;ethynyl or &#945;&#8208;triazole moiety, and represents the first successful kinetic resolution of racemates with a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter via CuAAC. Newly developed pyridinebisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands with a C4 phosphonate group play a key role.

         <title>Electron Transfer from Haem to the Di&#8208;Iron Ferroxidase Centre in Bacterioferritin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The haem in bacterioferritins has been shown before to provide an electron to the ferritin's mineral core&#8212;to reduce Fe3+ to water soluble Fe2+. This work shows that the haem can also provide an electron, over a distance of approximately 13&#8197;&#197;, to the di&#8208;iron ferroxidase centre of the protein, in a redox process not yet known.







Abstract
The iron redox cycle in ferritins is not completely understood. Bacterioferritins are distinct from other ferritins in that they contain haem groups. It is acknowledged that the two iron motifs in bacterioferritins, the di&#8208;nuclear ferroxidase centre and the haem B group, play key roles in two opposing processes, iron sequestration and iron mobilisation, respectively, and the two redox processes are independent. Herein, we show that in Escherichia coli bacterioferritin, there is an electron transfer pathway from the haem to the ferroxidase centre suggesting a new role(s) haem might play in bacterioferritins.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Aminopyridylation of [1.1.1]Propellane with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced aminopyridylation of propellane by photoabsorbing electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes has been developed by employing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents. This strategy can be extended to P&#8208;centered and CF3 radicals for the direct incorporation of these functional groups across the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) core, thus enabling straightforward construction of valuable pyridine&#8208;containing BCP chemical entities.







Abstract
Through the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, strain&#8208;release aminopyridylation of [1.1.1]propellane with N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents enabled the direct installation of amino and pyridyl groups onto bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) frameworks in the absence of an external photocatalyst. The robustness of this method to synthesize 1,3&#8208;aminopyridylated BCPs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex biorelevant molecules. Moreover, the strategy was extended to P&#8208;centered and CF3 radicals for the unprecedented incorporation of such functional groups with pyridine across the BCP core in a three&#8208;component coupling. This practical method lays the foundation for the straightforward construction of new valuable C4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;functionalized BCP chemical entities, thus significantly expanding the range of accessibility of BCP&#8208;type bioisosteres for applications in drug discovery.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Enabled O3 Phase Stabilization for Manganese&#8208;Rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O3 to P3 phase transition in layered sodium cathode materials induces large volume change and is detrimental to the performance. This work shows that the creation of transition metal and oxygen vacancies to the layered material can trigger multiple metastable intermediate phases that substantially prohibits the O3 to P3 phase transition and enables high&#8208;performance Na and Mn&#8208;rich layered materials.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, they usually form a P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn&#8208;rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ca. 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. It delivers ca. 160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific capacity between 2&#8211;3.8&#8197;V with &gt;86&#8201;% retention over 250&#8197;cycles. The TM and oxygen vacancies pre&#8208;formed in the sodiated material enables a reversible migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de&#8208;sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3&#8208;P3 phase transition.

         <title>Robust Packing of a Self&#8208;Assembling Iridium Complex via Endocytic Trafficking for Long&#8208;Term Lysosome Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex has been synthesized that emits light via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies are transformed from nanoparticles into sturdy packed networks that are stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment as super stable lysosomal probes, enabling super long&#8208;term live cell imaging.







Abstract
Live cell imaging of lysosome positioning and motility is critical to studying lysosome status and function for pharmacological interventions. To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we have designed and synthesized an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies are transformed from nanoparticles into sturdily packed networks that are stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescence intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.

         <title>Spectroscopic Evidence of Hyponitrite Radical Intermediate in NO Disproportionation at a MOF&#8208;Supported Mononuclear Copper Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical N2O2.&#8722; intermediate formed during a nitric oxide reductive coupling reaction was captured at a copper center in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Strict site isolation in the solid state is key in stabilizing this intermediate.







Abstract
Dianionic hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) is often proposed, based on model complexes, as the key intermediate in reductive coupling of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide at the bimetallic active sites of heme&#8208;copper oxidases and nitric oxide reductases. In this work, we examine the gas&#8208;solid reaction of nitric oxide with the metal&#8211;organic framework CuI&#8208;ZrTpmC* with a suite of in situ spectroscopies and density functional theory simulations, and identify an unusual chelating N2O2.&#8722; intermediate. These results highlight the advantage provided by site&#8208;isolation in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for studying important reaction intermediates, and provide a mechanistic scenario compatible with the proposed one&#8208;electron couple in these enzymes.

In this work, we examine the gas&#8208;solid reaction of nitric oxide with the metal&#8211;organic framework Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;ZrTpmC* with a suite of in situ spectroscopies and density functional theory simulations, and identify an unusual chelating N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate. These results highlight the advantage provided by site&#8208;isolation in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for studying important reaction intermediates, and provide a mechanistic scenario compatible with the proposed one&#8208;electron couple in these enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Crucial Role of Local Excess Charges in Dendrite Growth on Lithium Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5876-5881, March 8, 2021. </description>

Batteries based on Li metal promise a much higher energy density than the Li&#8197;ion batteries common today, where the ions are stored in graphite. However, Li&#8197;metal batteries are plagued by the formation of dendrites, which can short&#8208;circuit the battery. As shown by calculations, excess charge accumulates on small protrusions and creates a strong electric field, which attracts Li+ and induces further growth on the tip and finally the formation of dendrites.







Abstract
Much theoretical effort has been spent on the causes of dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries, but a decisive factor has been overlooked: Lithium is deposited on an electrode which carries a sizable negative charge, and this charge is not distributed homogeneously on the surface. We show by explicit model calculations that the excess charge accumulates on small protrusions and creates a strong electric field, which attracts the Li+ ions and induces further growth on the tip and finally the formation of dendrites. Even a small tip consisting of a few atoms will carry an excess charge of a tenth of a unit charge or more. In addition, the negative charge on the tips locally reduces the surface tension, which further fosters dendrite growth. The same principles can also explain dendrite formation on other metals with deposition potentials below the potential of zero charge.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Transformable Ferrous Ion Delivery System for Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6047-6054, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;triggered transformable ferrous ion (Fe2+) delivery agent (LET&#8208;6) was developed for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Thermal expansion caused by 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation triggers the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe2+, which primes the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment, thus generating .OH for enhanced CDT. This high&#8208;performance Fe2+ delivery system provides a sound basis for future synergistic metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) involves the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Fe2+ is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side&#8208;effects. Therefore, the development of a controllable Fe2+ delivery system is a challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity, and improve therapeutic efficacy. Reported here is a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered Fe2+ delivery agent (LET&#8208;6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modality imaging guided, photothermal primed CDT. Thermal expansion caused by 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation triggers the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe2+ from its hydrophobic layer, which primes the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment, thus generating .OH for enhanced CDT. LET&#8208;6 shows remarkable therapeutic effects, both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100&#8201;% tumor elimination after just one treatment. This high&#8208;performance Fe2+ delivery system provides a sound basis for future synergistic metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.

         <title>Nanoparticles Supported on Sub&#8208;Nanometer Oxide Films: Scaling Model Systems to Bulk Materials</title>

Palladium nanoparticles were partially covered by sub&#8208;nanometer thick layers of hectorite. Due to electronic interactions between the nanoparticles and the ultrathin layers the nanoparticles were positively charged. This in turn improved the performance for the oxidation of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Ultrathin layers of oxides deposited on atomically flat metal surfaces have been shown to significantly influence the electronic structure of the underlying metal, which in turn alters the catalytic performance. Upscaling of the specifically designed architectures as required for technical utilization of the effect has yet not been achieved. Here, we apply liquid crystalline phases of fluorohectorite nanosheets to fabricate such architectures in bulk. Synthetic sodium fluorohectorite, a layered silicate, when immersed into water spontaneously and repulsively swells to produce nematic suspensions of individual negatively charged nanosheets separated to more than 60&#8197;nm, while retaining parallel orientation. Into these galleries oppositely charged palladium nanoparticles were intercalated whereupon the galleries collapse. Individual and separated Pd nanoparticles were thus captured and sandwiched between nanosheets. As suggested by the model systems, the resulting catalyst performed better in the oxidation of carbon monoxide than the same Pd nanoparticles supported on external surfaces of hectorite or on a conventional Al2O3 support. XPS confirmed a shift of Pd 3d electrons to higher energies upon coverage of Pd nanoparticles with nanosheets to which we attribute the improved catalytic performance. DFT calculations showed increasing positive charge on Pd weakened CO adsorption and this way damped CO poisoning.

         <title>Precise Molecular&#8208;Level Modification of Nafion with Bismuth Oxide Clusters for High&#8208;performance Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>

A hybrid membrane (Nafion&#8208;Bi12&#8208;3&#8201;%) used as a high&#8208;performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is fabricated through molecular&#8208;level doping of {H6Bi12O16} clusters into ionic phase of Nafion. The clusters combine with anionic side chains of Nafion and optimize the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nano&#8208;phases, resulting in hybrid membranes with high proton conductivity, ideal mechanical and chemical stability, and low methanol permeability.







Abstract
Fabricating proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with high ionic conductivity and ideal mechanical robustness through regulation of the membrane microstructures achieved by molecular&#8208;level hybridization remains essential but challenging for the further development of high&#8208;performance PEM fuel cells. In this work, by precisely hybridizing nano&#8208;scaled bismuth oxide clusters into Nafion, we have fabricated the high&#8208;performance hybrid membrane, Nafion&#8208;Bi12&#8208;3&#8201;%, which showed a proton conductivity of 386&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous solution with low methanol permeability, and conserved the ideal mechanical and chemical stabilities as PEMs. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to clarify the structural properties and the assembly mechanisms of the hybrid membrane on the molecular level. The maximum current density and power density of Nafion&#8208;Bi12&#8208;3&#8201;% for direct methanol fuel cells reached to 432.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 110.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of versatile functional polymer electrolyte membranes through polyoxometalate hybridization.

The survival mechanism of mycobacterium inside the phagosome was translated to develop a new class of fusion inhibitor. The mycobacterium inspired simple lipo&#8208;dipeptide (myr&#8208;WD) inhibits the membrane fusion and protects cells from lethal type&#8197;1 influenza virus (H1N1) and murine coronavirus challenge as a potential broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral agent.







Abstract
The entry of enveloped virus requires the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. An effective fusion inhibitor aiming at impeding such membrane fusion may emerge as a broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral agent against a wide range of viral infections. Mycobacterium survives inside the phagosome by inhibiting phagosome&#8211;lysosome fusion with the help of a coat protein coronin&#8197;1. Structural analysis of coronin&#8197;1 and other WD40&#8208;repeat protein suggest that the trp&#8208;asp (WD) sequence is placed at distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif (more exposed) in coronin&#8197;1. The unique structural feature of coronin&#8197;1 was explored to identify a simple lipo&#8208;peptide sequence (myr&#8208;WD), which effectively inhibits membrane fusion by modulating the interfacial order, water penetration, and surface potential. The mycobacterium inspired lipo&#8208;dipeptide was successfully tested to combat type&#8197;1 influenza virus (H1N1) and murine coronavirus infections as a potential broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral agent.

         <title>Photocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance H2 Production: Ga&#8208;Doped Polymeric Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6124-6129, March 8, 2021. </description>

An all&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalyst, Ga&#8208;doped carbon nitride (CN), with an H2 production rate at 9900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, is prepared by a one&#8208;step calcination. Ga exists in the GaN4 form on CN, and serves as the H2 production center. The excited electron prefers the GaN4 site, which adsorbs the proton in the excited state and tends to desorption of H* in the ground state, thus enhancing the H2 production.







Abstract
A photocatalyst system is generally comprises a catalyst and cocatalyst to achieve light absorption, electron&#8208;hole separation, and surface reaction. It is a challenge to develop a single photocatalyst having all functions so as to lower the efficiency loss. Herein, the active GaN4 site is integrated into a polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H2 production rate of 9904&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. It is 162 and 3.3 times higher than that of CN with the absence (61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and presence (2981&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1), respectively, of 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt. Under light irradiation the electron is injected and stored at the GaN4 site, where the LUMO locates. The HOMO distributes on the aromatic ring resulting in spatial charge separation. Transient photovoltage discloses the electron&#8208;storage capability of GCN. The negative GaN4 promotes proton adsorption in the excited state. The positive adsorption energy drives H2 desorption from GaN4 after passing the electron to the proton. This work opens up opportunities for exploring a novel catalyst for H2 production.

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogenation of Heavy Homologues of Rhodium Carbynes: [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;E&#8208;Ar*] (E=Sn, Pb)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5882-5889, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy rhodium carbynes featuring a Rh&#8801;Sn or Rh&#8801;Pb triple bond were synthesized via dehydrogenation of the respective rhodium dihydride complexes [(Ph3P)2RhH2SnAr*] and [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*]. The syntheses were accomplished by reacting the nucleophilic organodihydridostannate with [(Ph3P)3RhCl] or in a hydride transfer reaction between [(Ph3P)3RhH] and organoelement hydrides of tin or lead.







Abstract
Tetrylidynes [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (10) and [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (11) are accessed for the first time via dehydrogenation of dihydrides [(Ph3P)2RhH2SnAr*] (3) and [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*] (7) (Ar*=2,6&#8208;Trip2C6H3, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), respectively. Tin dihydride 3 was either synthesized in reaction of the dihydridostannate [Ar*SnH2]&#8722; with [(Ph3P)3RhCl] or via reaction between hydrides [(Ph3P)3RhH] and 
&#8201;[(Ar*SnH)2]. Homologous lead hydride [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*] (7) was synthesized analogously from [(Ph3P)3RhH] and 
&#8201;[(Ar*PbH)2]. Abstraction of hydrogen from 3 and 7 supported by styrene and trimethylphosphine addition yields tetrylidynes 10 and 11. Stannylidyne 10 was also characterized by 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Hydrogenation of the triple bonds at room temperature with excess H2 gives the cis&#8208;dihydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2PbAr*] (12) and the tetrahydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2SnH2Ar*] (14). Complex 14 eliminates spontaneously one equivalent of hydrogen at room temperature to give the dihydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2SnAr*] (13). Hydrogen addition and elimination at stannylene tin between complexes 13 and 14 is a reversible reaction at room temperature.

         <title>Endogenous mRNA Triggered DNA&#8208;Au Nanomachine for In Situ Imaging and Targeted Multimodal Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5948-5958, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine which can be triggered by endogenous tumor growth&#8208;related TK1 mRNA has been devised as the combinatorial theranostic agent for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided chemo, genic, photodynamic, and photothermal synergistic targeted therapy of breast cancer. This theranostic nanoplatform achieves the significant inhibition of tumor growth and improvement of therapeutic efficacy through in situ imaging.







Abstract
The development of versatile nanotheranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functions have always been an intractable challenge in precise cancer treatment. Herein, an aptamer&#8208;tethered deoxyribonucleic acids&#8208;gold particle (Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au) nanomachine has been developed for in situ imaging and targeted multimodal synergistic therapy of mammary carcinoma. Upon specifically internalized into MCF&#8208;7 cells, the tumor&#8208;related TK1 mRNA activates the Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine by DNA strand displacement cascades, resulting in the release of the fluorophore and antisense DNA as well as the aggregation of AuNPs for in situ imaging, suppression of survivin expression and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the controlled released drugs are used for chemotherapy, while under the laser irradiation the loaded photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy. The results confirm that the proposed Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine provides a powerful nanotheranostic platform for in situ imaging&#8208;guided combinatorial anticancer therapy.

This theranostic nanoplatform achieves the significant inhibition of tumor growth and improvement of therapeutic efficacy through in situ imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of versatile nanotheranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functions have always been an intractable challenge in precise cancer treatment. Herein, an aptamer&#8208;tethered deoxyribonucleic acids&#8208;gold particle (Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au) nanomachine has been developed for in situ imaging and targeted multimodal synergistic therapy of mammary carcinoma. Upon specifically internalized into MCF&#8208;7 cells, the tumor&#8208;related TK1 mRNA activates the Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine by DNA strand displacement cascades, resulting in the release of the fluorophore and antisense DNA as well as the aggregation of AuNPs for in situ imaging, suppression of survivin expression and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the controlled released drugs are used for chemotherapy, while under the laser irradiation the loaded photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy. The results confirm that the proposed Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine provides a powerful nanotheranostic platform for in situ imaging&#8208;guided combinatorial anticancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anionic Polymerization in Porous Organic Frameworks: A Strategy to Fabricate Anchored Polymers and Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6117-6123, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic frameworks provide the suitable hydrocarbon cavities for anionic polymerization and copolymerization of isoprene and methylmethacrylate, forming core&#8211;shell nanostructured materials. Lithiation reaction on the frameworks generated multiple anion initiators which promoted the growth of anchored chains.







Abstract
An anionic mechanism is used to create polymers and copolymers as confined to, or anchored to, high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous nanoparticles. Linear polymers with soft and glassy chains, such as polyisoprene and polymethylmethacrylate, were produced by confined anionic polymerization in 3D networks of porous aromatic frameworks. Alternatively, multiple anions were generated on the designed frameworks which bear removal protons at selected positions, and initiate chain propagation, resulting in chains covalently connected to the 3D network. Such growth can continue outside the pores to produce polymer&#8208;matrix nanoparticles coated with anchored chains. Sequential reactions were promoted by the living character of this anionic propagation, yielding nanoparticles that were covered by a second polymer anchored by anionic block copolymerization. The intimacy of the matrix and the grown&#8208;in polymers was demonstrated by magnetization transfer across the interfaces in 2D 1H&#8208;13C&#8208;HETCOR NMR spectra.

Thermodynamic comparisons for O2&#8208;derived iron&#8208;porphyrinate interrelated ferric heme superoxide, peroxide, and hydroperoxide analogues in the presence and absence of an appended imidazolyl axial base are presented.







Abstract
A new end&#8208;on low&#8208;spin ferric heme peroxide, [(PIm)FeIII&#8722;(O22&#8722;)]&#8722; (PIm&#8208;P), and subsequently formed hydroperoxide species, [(PIm)FeIII&#8722;(OOH)] (PIm&#8208;HP) are generated utilizing the iron&#8208;porphyrinate PIm with its tethered axial base imidazolyl group. Measured thermodynamic parameters, the ferric heme superoxide [(PIm)FeIII&#8722;(O2&#8901;&#8722;)] (PIm&#8208;S) reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;) and the PIm&#8208;HP pKa value, lead to the finding of the OO&#8722;H bond&#8208;dissociation free energy (BDFE) of PIm&#8208;HP as 69.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 using a thermodynamic square scheme and Bordwell relationship. The results are validated by the observed oxidizing ability of PIm&#8208;S via hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) compared to that of the F8 superoxide complex, [(F8)FeIII&#8722;(O2.&#8722;)] (S) (F8=tetrakis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)porphyrinate, without an internally appended axial base imidazolyl), as determined from reactivity comparison of superoxide complexes PIm&#8208;S and S with the hydroxylamine (O&#8208;H) substrates TEMPO&#8208;H and ABNO&#8208;H.

The control of the energy transfer and the emission colour is demonstrated for the first time in molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, through the targeted choice of the lanthanide composition, a novel pure white&#8208;light emitting cluster&#8208;aggregate was isolated. This approach can pave new avenues into the future of efficient optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies.







Abstract
Counterfeit goods represent a major problem to companies, governments, and customers, affecting the global economy. In order to protect the authenticity of products and documents, optical anti&#8208;counterfeit technologies have widely been employed via the use of discrete molecular species, extended metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and nanoparticles. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the potential use of molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates (MCA) as optical barcodes via composition and energy transfer control. The tuneable optical properties for the [Ln20(chp)30(CO3)12(NO3)6(H2O)6], where chp&#8722;=deprotonated 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol, allow the fine control of the emission colour output, resulting in high&#8208;security level optical labelling with a precise read&#8208;out. Moreover, a unique tri&#8208;doped composition of GdIII, TbIII, and EuIII led to MCAs with white&#8208;light emission. The presented methodology is a unique approach to probe the effect of composition control on the luminescent properties of nanosized molecular material.

         <title>Masked Alkyne Equivalents for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Polyynes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5941-5947, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active&#8208;metal&#8208;template synthesis has been used to prepare a [2]rotaxane in which the whole dumbbell component is a masked C16H2 polyyne. t&#8208;Butyl substituents make the photo&#8208;labile terminal groups bulky enough to act as stoppers and prevent unthreading of the macrocycle. Rotaxanes of this type are promising intermediates in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures, such as cyclocarbon catenanes and carbyne polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Polyyne polyrotaxanes, encapsulated cyclocarbon catenanes and other fascinating mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures should become accessible if masked alkyne equivalents (MAEs) can be developed that are large enough to prevent unthreading of a macrocycle, and that can be cleanly unmasked under mild conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on t&#8208;butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked&#8208;polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo&#8208;oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures.

Herein, we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked&#8208;polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo&#8208;oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;Step Sixfold Cyanation of Benzothiadiazole Acceptor Units for Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

A new strongly electron&#8208;accepting end group, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT), has been prepared by a one&#8208;step sixfold nucleophilic substitution reaction. Cyanation results in a significant enhancement of the electron affinity in comparison to the fluorinated analogue, and the material demonstrates promising n&#8208;type performance in solution processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors with excellent stability.







Abstract
Reported here is a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a sixfold nucleophilic substitution with cyanide on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach. This one&#8208;step chemical modification significantly impacted the molecular properties: the fluorinated precursor, TFBT IDT, a poor ambipolar semiconductor, was converted into TCNBT IDT, a good n&#8208;type semiconductor. The electron&#8208;deficient end group TCNBT dramatically decreased the energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) compared to the fluorinated analogue and improved the molecular orientation when utilized in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Solution&#8208;processed OFETs based on TCNBT IDT exhibited a charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to &#956;e&#8776;0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with excellent ambient stability for 100&#8197;hours, highlighting the benefits of the cyanated end group and the synthetic approach.

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization Provides a Function&#8208;Integrated System for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5965-5969, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four&#8208;electron oxidation of water with a function&#8208;integrated polymer is reported. Electrochemical polymerization provided a material with molecule&#8208;based active sites and hole&#8208;transporting moieties (see picture). Electrochemical impedance analysis revealed that the hole&#8208;transporting polymer reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance. The material catalyzed electrochemical water oxidation with high faradaic efficiency and a low overpotential.







Abstract
Water oxidation is a key reaction in natural and artificial photosynthesis. In nature, the reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst surrounded by hole&#8208;transporting amino acid residues. However, in artificial systems, there is no example of a water oxidation system that has a catalytic center surrounded by hole transporters. Herein, we present a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system. Electrochemical polymerization of a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based precursor afforded a polymer&#8208;based material (Poly&#8208;1). Poly&#8208;1 exhibited excellent hole&#8208;transporting ability and catalyzed water oxidation with high performance. It was also revealed that the catalytic activity was almost completely suppressed in the absence of the hole&#8208;transporting moieties. The present study provides a novel strategy for constructing efficient molecule&#8208;based systems for water oxidation.

         <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5936-5940, March 8, 2021. </description>

PST&#8208;31, a novel aluminosilicate zeolite with all odd&#8208;membered rings from five to eleven, has been synthesized in hydroxide media. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n&#8208;hexane to light olefins.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31, which has an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al=16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing four&#8208;, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered rings, which are connected by single four&#8208;membered rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by nine&#8208;, ten&#8208;, and eleven&#8208;membered rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [42.514.64.72.94] cavities composed of smaller [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n&#8208;hexane to light olefins.

         <title>Octagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene as a Chiral Motif for Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emission of Saddle&#8208;Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6094-6100, March 8, 2021. </description>

Using &#960;&#8208;extended oct&#8208;[5]helicene as novel helical unit, a new family of saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is prepared. They are chiral and emissive compounds that become part of the still exclusive family of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;emissive nanographenes.







Abstract
We report a new family of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based helical nanographenes incorporating &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes bearing an octagonal carbocycle. This family represents a new kind of highly distorted saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes. For the first time, the eight&#8208;membered ring becomes a constituent of both a carbo[5]helicene and a HBC and thus, the negative curvature is responsible for twisting both units. This novel chiral motif, namely, oct&#8208;[5]helicene results in the largest torsion angle recorded so far for a carbo[5]helicene (&#952;=79.5&#176;), as it has been suggested by DFT&#8208;calculations and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Consequently, the barriers of isomerization become exceptionally high for a [5]helicene unsubstituted in the fjord region since neither racemization nor decomposition were observed at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 1 or 3 during 5&#8197;h. Therefore, racemic resolutions allowed subsequent chiroptical studies showing the ECD and CPL responses of this novel family of chiral nanographenes.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>

We demonstrated the first example to use imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone, and showed that the COFs&#8217; performance could surpass traditional materials. The mechanism for the performance of imine&#8208;based COFs is unveiled.







Abstract
Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. Herein, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1&#8197;s) to ozone as low as 0.1&#8197;ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was unveiled in&#8208;depth by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.

         <title>Dried Blood Spot Self&#8208;Sampling with Automated Capillary Electrophoresis Processing for Clinical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6068-6075, March 8, 2021. </description>

An all&#8208;in&#8208;one concept is presented, which enables at&#8208;home dried blood spot (DBS) self&#8208;sampling, DBS transport to a clinical laboratory by mail, and a fully automated DBS elution/analysis. It provides an elegant analytical tool for personalized health monitoring and clinical analyses in pandemic situations; moreover, it could help shift the current sick&#8208;care&#8208;based healthcare system to a prevention&#8208;based one.







Abstract
A simple and convenient concept of blood sampling followed by a fully automated analysis is presented. A disposable sampling kit is used for accurate self&#8208;sampling of capillary blood from a finger prick. A high&#8208;throughput blood sampling is thus enabled, which is essential in many clinical assays and considerably improves life quality and comfort of involved subjects. The collected blood samples are mailed to a laboratory for a fully automated dried blood spot (DBS) processing and analysis, which are performed with a commercial capillary electrophoresis instrument. Quantitative results are obtained within 20&#8197;min from the DBS delivery to the laboratory. The presented concept is exemplified by the determination of warfarin blood concentrations and demonstrates excellent analytical performance. Moreover, this concept is generally applicable to a wide range of endogenous and exogenous blood compounds and represents a novel and attractive analytical tool for personalized health monitoring.

         <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6036-6041, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 79&#8201;% with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state is possible with a novel series of mononuclear aluminum complexes. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices based on these Al complexes achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine&#8208;modified asymmetric acetylacetonate&#8208;type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79&#8201;% in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;s. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the best performance in light metal&#8208;based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting technology.

         <title>Inhibition of Urease, a Ni&#8208;Enzyme: The Reactivity of a Key Thiol With Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Substituted Catechols Elucidated by Kinetic, Structural, and Theoretical Studies</title>

The inhibition of urease by mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols was investigated. The results reveal the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor.







Abstract
The inhibition of urease from Sporosarcina&#8197;pasteurii (SPU) and Canavalia&#8197;ensiformis (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.

         <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain of Function by Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6021-6028, March 8, 2021. </description>

A small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated selection method was developed to obtain a &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; with activatable binding affinity toward its target. The aptamer's binding can be activated by &#8220;clipping&#8221; two intramolecular motifs via a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule.







Abstract
Click reactions have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221;, whose binding affinity is regulated by the &#8220;clip&#8221;&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de&#8197;novo selection of clipped aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated clipped aptamers can achieve the efficient transition from a binding&#8208;inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results showed that the clipped aptamer had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, clipped aptamers hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.

&lt;p&gt;Click reactions have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221;, whose binding affinity is regulated by the &#8220;clip&#8221;&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de&#8197;novo selection of clipped aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated clipped aptamers can achieve the efficient transition from a binding&#8208;inactive state to an active state by clipping of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results showed that the clipped aptamer had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, clipped aptamers hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Donor/Acceptor Pairs Created by Electrostatic Interaction: Design, Synthesis, and Investigation on the Exciplex Formed Within the Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6013-6020, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor/acceptor pairs are created by electrostatic interaction between an anionic donor and a cationic acceptor, which afford an isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence in a diluted film. Interactions between donor and acceptor are changed by varying the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the acceptor. The pairs show mechanochromic luminescence in the solid state and promising performances in light&#8208;emitting devices.







Abstract
Exciplexes formed between donors and acceptors have been widely explored but isolating them from each other and tuning the interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here, we report donor/acceptor (D/A) pairs created by electrostatic interaction between a carbazole&#8208;based anionic donor and a 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;based cationic acceptor and the exciplex formed within the pair. In a diluted film, the D/A pair affords an isolated exciplex which shows thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, interactions between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to the conventional exciplex formed in a neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescence efficiency. The D/A pairs show intriguing mechanochromic luminescence and mechanical grinding&#8208;induced/reinforced TADF in the solid state and promising performances as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

A carboranealkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28 possessing an open&#8208;shell electronic structure with 13 valence electrons was isolated through a facile self&#8208;reduction method in which it undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a smaller&#8208;sized cluster Au23 bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal&#8208;field&#8208;like split superatomic 1D orbitals. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis&#8211;NIR range and NIR emission.







Abstract
Structure evolution has become an effective way to assemble novel monolayer&#8208;protected metal nanomolecules. However, evolution with alkynyl&#8208;stabilized metal clusters still remains rarely explored. Herein, we present a carboranealkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster [Au28(C4B10H11)12(tht)8]3+ (Au28, tht=tetrahydrothiophene) possessing an open&#8208;shell electronic structure with 13 free electrons, which was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reduction method with 9&#8208;HC&#8801;C&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H11 as the two&#8208;in&#8208;one reducing and protecting agent. Notably, Au28 undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a stable and smaller&#8208;sized nanocluster [Au23(C4B10H11)9(tht)6]2+ (Au23) bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal&#8208;field&#8208;like split superatomic 1D orbitals. The transformation process was systematically monitored with ESI&#8208;MS and UV/Vis absorption spectra. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis&#8211;NIR range and NIR emission, which facilitates their potential application in the biomedical and photocatalytic fields.

         <title>In Vivo Assembly of Artificial Metalloenzymes and Application in Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5913-5920, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial metalloenzymes were created by supramolecular assembly in the cytoplasm of E.&#8197;coli cells. The cells were then applied to the enantioselective biocatalysis of a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles (see picture) and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Directed evolution of the artificial metalloenzymes inside the cells provided improved variants for both whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
We report the supramolecular assembly of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), based on the Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) and an exogeneous copper(II)&#8211;phenanthroline complex, in the cytoplasm of E.&#8197;coli cells. A combination of catalysis, cell&#8208;fractionation, and inhibitor experiments, supplemented with in&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, confirmed the in&#8208;cell assembly. The ArM&#8208;containing whole cells were active in the catalysis of the enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles and the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene. Directed evolution resulted in two different improved mutants for both reactions, LmrR_A92E_M8D and LmrR_A92E_V15A, respectively. The whole&#8208;cell ArM system required no engineering of the microbial host, the protein scaffold, or the cofactor to achieve ArM assembly and catalysis. We consider this a key step towards integrating abiological catalysis with biosynthesis to generate a hybrid metabolism.

Surface sites and resulting methanol adsorbates strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes, and consequently play a key role in the photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals was studied by in&#8197;situ and time&#8208;resolved characterizations and DFT calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold&#8208;coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c localized density of states are almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, facilitating the interfacial hole transfer process; CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage promotes upward surface band bending, facilitating bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface hole migration. CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. TiO2 nanocrystals enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Bond Zincation of Arenes: Scope, Mechanism, and the Role of Heterometallic Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6145-6153, March 8, 2021. </description>

A palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;Zn bonds. The reaction scope includes fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene. Heterometallic Pd&#8211;Zn complexes play a key role in the catalysis.







Abstract
Catalytic methods that transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X=B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X=Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C&#8722;H bonds remains unknown. Herein, we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;Zn bonds. The new catalytic C&#8722;H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes&#8212;including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene&#8212;with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd&#8211;Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C&#8722;H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps of C&#8722;H functionalisation.

A cation/anion co&#8208;alloying strategy is applied to prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2&#8722;x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed quantum dots (QDs). The band gap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states of the QDs can be conveniently tailored through composition engineering. The quinary alloyed QDs deliver a new certified efficiency record of 14.4&#8201;% for quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
The photoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) have a critical impact on the performance of quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Currently, I&#8208;III&#8208;VI group QDs have become the mainstream light&#8208;harvesting materials in high&#8208;performance QDSCs. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve satisfactory efficiency for light&#8208;harvesting, charge extraction, and charge collection simultaneously in QDSCs. We design and prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2&#8722;x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed QDs by cation/anion co&#8208;alloying strategy. The critical photoelectronic properties of target QDs, including band gap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states, can be conveniently tailored. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZCISSe quinary alloyed QDs can achieve an ideal balance among light&#8208;harvesting, photogenerated electron extraction, and charge&#8208;collection efficiencies in QDSCs compared to its single anion or cation quaternary alloyed QD counterparts. Consequently, the quinary alloyed QDs boost the certified efficiency of QDSCs to 14.4&#8201;%, which is a new efficiency record for liquid&#8208;junction QD solar cells.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6086-6093, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 3D COFs with interpenetrated open frameworks were synthesized from tetrahedral tetraamine and enantiopure BINOL dialdehydes. The resulting 3D COF was capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective under confinement effect in catalyzing important organic transformation with high catalytic activity and good recyclability.







Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;defined porous channels are shown to be capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9&#8208;fold or 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. DFT calculations show the COF catalyst provides preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of T&#8197;Lymphocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5921-5927, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) is synthesized for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) detection of granzyme&#8197;B, a biomarker related to activation of cytotoxic T&#8197;lymphocytes. SPNP actively targets the tumor and reacts with granzyme&#8197;B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging of T&#8197;lymphocytes during cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Development of real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive imaging probes to assess infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is critical to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, which however remains challenging. Reported here is an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of a biomarker (granzyme&#8197;B) associated with activation of CTLs. SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme&#8197;B cleavable and dye&#8208;labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals. After systemic administration, SPNP passively targets the tumor and in situ reacts with granzyme&#8197;B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to decreased NIRF and PA signals from the dye but unchanged signals from the polymer. Such ratiometric NIRF and PA signals of SPNP correlate well with the expression level of granzyme&#8197;B and intratumoral population of CTLs. Thus, this study not only presents the first PA probes for in vivo imaging of immune activation but also provides a molecular design strategy that can be generalized for molecular imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers.

&lt;p&gt;An activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) is synthesized for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) detection of granzyme&#8197;B, a biomarker related to activation of cytotoxic T&#8197;lymphocytes. SPNP actively targets the tumor and reacts with granzyme&#8197;B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging of T&#8197;lymphocytes during cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive imaging probes to assess infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is critical to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, which however remains challenging. Reported here is an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of a biomarker (granzyme&#8197;B) associated with activation of CTLs. SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme&#8197;B cleavable and dye&#8208;labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals.

Thus, this study not only presents the first PA probes for in vivo imaging of immune activation but also provides a molecular design strategy that can be generalized for molecular imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;

The highly reactive divalent sandwich (Cot)2Tm{K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)}2 exhibits slow magnetic relaxation in absence of a DC field, an unprecedented report for f13 configuration. The variation of the counter&#8208;cation influences the magnetic relaxation in line with the overall stability of the organometallic sandwich complex.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide organometallics are well&#8208;known highly reducing compounds usually used for single electron transfer reactivity and small molecule activation. Thus, their very reactive nature prevented for many years the study of their physical properties, such as magnetic studies on a reliable basis. Herein, the access to rare organometallic sandwich compounds of TmII with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand impacts on the use of divalent organolanthanide compounds as an additional strategy for the design of performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMM). The first divalent thulium sandwich complex with f13 configuration behaving as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in absence of DC field is highlighted.

         <title>Targeted Delivery of Persulfides to the Gut: Effects on the Microbiome</title>

The persulfide donor NDP&#8208;NAC (see structure) was synthesized and found to decompose in response to E.&#8197;coli nitroreductase with the release of N&#8208;acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC&#8208;SSH). NDP&#8208;NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice by the upregulation of beneficial small&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain fatty acids, by increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium, and by decreasing populations of pathogenic Synergistales bacteria.







Abstract
Persulfides (R&#8722;SSH) have been hypothesized as potent redox modulators and signaling compounds. Reported herein is the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo evaluation of a persulfide donor that releases N&#8208;acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC&#8208;SSH) in response to the prokaryote&#8208;specific enzyme nitroreductase. The donor, termed NDP&#8208;NAC, decomposed in response to E.&#8197;coli nitroreductase, resulting in release of NAC&#8208;SSH. NDP&#8208;NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice that were not observed in animals treated with control compounds incapable of persulfide release or in animals treated with Na2S. NDP&#8208;NAC induced these effects by the upregulation of beneficial small&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain fatty acids and through increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium. It also decreased the populations of Synergistales bacteria, opportunistic pathogens implicated in gastrointestinal infections. This study reveals the possibility of maintaining gut health or treating microbiome&#8208;related diseases by the targeted delivery of reactive sulfur species.

         <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5984-5993, March 8, 2021. </description>

An efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 production was designed by constructing the Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (Ni3N&#8208;Co3N PNAs/NF). The catalyst can achieve energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) unit, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of &#8722;43 and &#8722;88&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and achieving an industry&#8208;level 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 200&#8197;mV for HzOR. The two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76&#8197;V for 10 and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The H2 production powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work provides a rationale for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy&#8208;saving H2 generation techniques.

         <title>Non&#8208;Coordinative Binding of O2 at the Active Center of a Copper&#8208;Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6154-6159, March 8, 2021. </description>

Structural evidence suggests that the formylglycine generating enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed but not coordinated to the copper&#8208;center prior to any redox activity.







Abstract
Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.

Isostructural complexes that contain Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; instead of Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; or nitric oxide instead of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

An ether&#8211;ionic liquid composite electrolyte with fast ion transport, superior desolvation capability, and high electrochemical stability is exploited to suppress sodium dendrite growth at low temperatures ranging from 0 to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;hours at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in lean electrolyte (1.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1) conditions.







Abstract
Enabling high&#8208;performing alkali metal anodes at low temperature and in lean electrolyte conditions is critical for the advancement of next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and improved safety. We present an ether&#8211;ionic liquid composite electrolyte to tackle the problem of dendrite growth of metallic sodium anode at low temperatures ranging from 0 to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;hours at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in lean electrolyte (1.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1) conditions. Using the composite electrolyte, full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode and sodium metal as anode present a high capacity retention of 90.7&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2C at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The sodium&#8211;carbon dioxide batteries also exhibit a reversible capacity of 1,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 50 cycles across a range of temperatures from &#8722;20 to 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Benzyl Trifluoroborate and Organic Halides**

A redox&#8208;neutral electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling method is developed using bench&#8208;stable substrates and Ni catalysts. The Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling exhibits good reaction efficiency, has practical applications, and expands the synthetic toolbox to forge carbon&#8211;carbon bonds.







Abstract
Reported here is the redox neutral electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling reaction of bench&#8208;stable aryl halides or &#946;&#8208;bromostyrene (electrophiles) and benzylic trifluoroborates (nucleophiles) using nonprecious, bench&#8208;stable NiCl2&#8901;glyme/polypyridine catalysts in an undivided cell configuration under ambient conditions. The broad reaction scope and good yields of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical coupling reactions were confirmed by 50 examples of aryl/&#946;&#8208;styrenyl chloride/bromide and benzylic trifluoroborates. Potential applications were demonstrated by electrosynthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals and natural amino acid modification, and three reactions were run on gram&#8208;scale in a flow&#8208;cell electrolyzer. The electrochemical C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through an unconventional radical transmetalation mechanism. This method is highly productive and expected to find wide&#8208;spread applications in organic synthesis.

         <title>Nanoscale Hybrid Amorphous/Graphitic Carbon as Key Towards Next&#8208;Generation Carbon&#8208;Based Oxidative Dehydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5898-5906, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous/graphitic hybrid material is synthesized by growing nanoscale graphite crystallites in a non&#8208;nano polymer&#8208;derived carbon by catalytic graphitization. An active dehydrogenation catalyst is obtained by creating accessibility to these graphitic domains via selective oxidation. This carbon dehydrogenation catalyst offers a 10&#8208;fold increase in space&#8208;time&#8208;yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol compared to a carbon nanotube benchmark.







Abstract
A new strategy affords &#8220;non&#8208;nano&#8221; carbon materials as dehydrogenation catalysts that perform similarly to nanocarbons. Polymer&#8208;based carbon precursors that combine a soft&#8208;template approach with ion adsorption and catalytic graphitization are key to this synthesis strategy, thus offering control over macroscopic shape, texture, and crystallinity and resulting in a hybrid amorphous/graphitic carbon after pyrolysis. From this intermediate the active carbon catalyst is prepared by removing the amorphous parts of the hybrid carbon materials via selective oxidation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol was chosen as test reaction, which shows that fine&#8208;tuning the synthesis of the new carbon catalysts allows to obtain a catalytic material with an attractive high selectivity (82&#8201;%) similar to a carbon nanotube reference, while achieving 10&#8197;times higher space&#8211;time yields at 330&#8201;&#176;C. This new class of carbon materials is accessible via a technically scalable, reproducible synthetic pathway and exhibits spherical particles with diameters around 100&#8197;&#956;m, allowing unproblematic handling similar to classic non&#8208;nano catalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis&#8208;Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5994-6002, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoconvergence is observed in the enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, where the selectivity factor for chiral copolymer formation significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted substrate at various conversions.







Abstract
Unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides was mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. Unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. Catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are strongly influenced by the phenolate ortho&#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. An enantiopure binaphthol&#8208;linked bimetallic AlIII complex allows stereoconvergent access to the stereoregular semi&#8208;crystalline polyesters and a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates.

Silver nanoparticles converted into single atoms bring about a significant improvement in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a 95.7&#8201;% faradic efficiency for CO production.







Abstract
We report an Ag1 single&#8208;atom catalyst (Ag1/MnO2), which was synthesized from thermal transformation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and surface reconstruction of MnO2. The evolution process of Ag NPs to single atoms is firstly revealed by various techniques, including in&#8197;situ ETEM, in&#8197;situ XRD and DFT calculations. The temperature&#8208;induced surface reconstruction process from the MnO2 (211) to (310) lattice plane is critical to firmly confine the existing surface of Ag single atoms; that is, the thermal treatment and surface reconstruction of MnO2 is the driving force for the formation of single Ag atoms. The as&#8208;obtained Ag1/MnO2 achieved 95.7&#8201;% Faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). DFT calculations indicated single Ag sites possessed high electronic density close to Fermi Level and could act exclusively as the active sites in the CO2RR. As a result, the Ag1/MnO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable performance for the CO2RR, far surpassing the conventional Ag nanosized catalyst (AgNP/MnO2) and other reported Ag&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5928-5935, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential effect of the static surface tensor for metal alloy surfaces is found to be significantly larger than size&#8208;related effects as demonstrated by oxide shell and stabilizing ligand composition. Considering these finds, the free&#8208;energy equation related to solid&#8211;liquid phase transformation, under the classical nucleation theory, is extended to incorporate the stress&#8208;component resulting from the passivating shell.







Abstract
Undercooling metals relies on frustration of liquid&#8211;solid transition mainly by an increase in activation energy. Passivating oxide layers are a way to isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7&#8211;5&#8197;nm) oxide shell, slowing homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. We demonstrate that 1)&#8197;the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat&#8208;free solders, 2)&#8197;inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and 3)&#8197;the magnitude of the influence of the passivating oxide can be larger than size effects in undercooling.

         <title>Unimolecular Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6003-6012, March 8, 2021. </description>

An effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis is described. Herein, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight stereoregular polyesters.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels through dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis where 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) to furnish highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph&#8208;PLA) with molecular weight (MW) up to 150.0&#8197;kDa, which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high MW stereoregular polyesters. Calculations and experimental studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion&#8208;binding mechanism, where the dynamic anion&#8208;binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring&#8208;opening over side reactions (such as cyclization, epimerization, and transesterification).

Water oxidation is a key reaction in natural and artificial photosynthesis. In their Research Article on page&#8197;5965, Mio Kondo, Shigeyuki Masaoka, and co&#8208;workers report a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system, which is inspired by the natural water oxidation catalyst. A metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based precursor was electrochemically polymerized, and the obtained polymer&#8208;based material exhibits excellent hole&#8208;transporting ability and catalyzes water oxidation with high performance.

Cool frustration. Engineering composition across a thin surface oxide layer of a metal particle, and stabilizing it with appropriate ligands, leads to a sharp surface stress that frustrates solidification. Chemical potential gradients from compositional variation and ligand inductive effects all contribute to stabilization of a metastable state. An undercooled liquid metal particle is formed, highlighting a new paradigm in engineering energy landscape of a material using thin surface layer, as described by Martin Thuo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;5928.

Crystallinity is the key for the design of a new generation of carbon&#8208;based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In their Research Article on page&#8197;5898, Bastian&#8197;J.&#8197;M. Etzold and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of a novel carbon catalyst that exhibits a comparatively large particle size (100&#8197;&#956;m) while featuring an easily accessible crystalline nanostructure. An order of magnitude higher space&#8211;time yields could be achieved with this new catalyst system compared to carbon nanotubes as benchmark.

Abstract
Severe side effects and poor therapeutic efficacy are the main drawbacks of current anticancer drugs. These problems can be mitigated by targeting, but the targeting efficacy of current drugs is poor and urgently needs improvement. Taking this into consideration, this Review first summarizes the current targeting strategies for cancer therapy in terms of cancer tissue and organelles. Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe side effects and poor therapeutic efficacy are the main drawbacks of current anticancer drugs. These problems can be mitigated by targeting, but the targeting efficacy of current drugs is poor and urgently needs improvement. Taking this into consideration, this Review first summarizes the current targeting strategies for cancer therapy in terms of cancer tissue and organelles. Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interfacing Living and Synthetic Cells as an Emerging Frontier in Synthetic Biology</title>

This Minireview outlines the state of play in the research area of cellular bionics, where biological and synthetic cells are hybridised, thus bridging the living/non&#8208;living divide.







Abstract
The construction of artificial cells from inanimate molecular building blocks is one of the grand challenges of our time. In addition to being used as simplified cell models to decipher the rules of life, artificial cells have the potential to be designed as micromachines deployed in a host of clinical and industrial applications. The attractions of engineering artificial cells from scratch, as opposed to re&#8208;engineering living biological cells, are varied. However, it is clear that artificial cells cannot currently match the power and behavioural sophistication of their biological counterparts. Given this, many in the synthetic biology community have started to ask: is it possible to interface biological and artificial cells together to create hybrid living/synthetic systems that leverage the advantages of both? This article will discuss the motivation behind this cellular bionics approach, in which the boundaries between living and non&#8208;living matter are blurred by bridging top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. It details the state of play of this nascent field and introduces three generalised hybridisation modes that have emerged.

Thanks to their predesigned structure, intrinsic porosity and decent conductivity, 2D c&#8208;MOFs have attracted considerable attention especially in electrochemical energy storage. In this Minireview, the progress of 2D c&#8208;MOFs is surveyed with a focus on the structural design principles, electrical properties and potential applications in supercapacitors and batteries.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) as an emerging class of multifunctional materials have attracted extensive attention due to their predictable and diverse structures, intrinsic permanent porosity, high charge mobility, and excellent electrical conductivity. Such unique characteristics render them as a promising new platform for electrical related devices. This Minireview highlights the recent key progress of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with emphasis on the design strategies, unique electrical properties, and potential applications in electrochemical energy storage. The thorough elucidation of structure&#8211;function correlations may offer a guidance for the development of 2D c&#8208;MOFs based next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

Biocatalytic reductions: Enzymes catalyse reduction reactions with exquisite stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, leading the way to shorter alternatives to classical synthetic routes!







Abstract
Reductions play a key role in organic synthesis, producing chiral products with new functionalities. Enzymes can catalyse such reactions with exquisite stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, leading the way to alternative shorter classical synthetic routes towards not only high&#8208;added&#8208;value compounds but also bulk chemicals. In this review we describe the synthetic state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and potential of enzymes that catalyse reductions, ranging from carbonyl, enone and aromatic reductions to reductive aminations.

         <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5704-5707, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides reducing dinitrogen, nitrogenases reduce CO to hydrocarbons, mediating C&#8722;C bond formation between multiple CO&#8208;derived ligands. To shed light on how multiple C&#8208;based ligands bind to the active site, we report a 1.33&#8197;&#197; resolution crystal structure of two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of molybdenum nitrogenase (see picture). The second CO ligand is coordinated to Fe6 in a previously unreported ligand binding mode.







Abstract
As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active&#8208;site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8211;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO or CO&#8208;derived ligands bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33&#8197;&#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged roles for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Subcellular Distribution of Ultrasmall Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emitting Gold Nanoparticles</title>

Ultrasmall NIR&#8208;emitting CR&#8208;AuNPs showed strong membrane binding in high concentration but more mitochondria targeting in lower concentration. This concentration&#8208;dependent subcellular distribution performed large advances for photocytotoxicity to tumour cells in a relatively low concentration region, providing the deeper understanding of the ultrasmall luminescent AuNPs in biomedicine.







Abstract
The ability to accurately control the subcellular distribution of nanomedicines provides unique advantages on understanding of cellular biology and disease theranostics. The nanomedicine concentration is a key factor to affect the theranostic efficiency and systematic toxicity. Herein, we unravel a concentration&#8208;dependent subcellular distribution of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) co&#8208;coated with glutathione and a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide CR8 (CR&#8208;AuNPs), which shows a strong membrane&#8208;binding at high concentration but more endocytosis for mitochondria targeting at the low concentration region. Attributing to high content of AuI and microsecond luminescent lifetimes, these AuNPs can catalyze dissolved oxygen to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) efficiently. Combining with the concentration&#8208;dependent subcellular distribution, the luminescent AuNPs show photocytotoxicity in the relative low concentration region. These findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of the biological behaviors and potential cytotoxicity of ultrasmall luminescent AuNPs toward future theranostics.

         <title>Thermally Activated n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors Achieved by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Based Dopant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5816-5820, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with excellent air stability and high n&#8208;doping efficacy is developed. It can regenerate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene in situ by decarboxylation for the subsequent n&#8208;doping. The thermally activated n&#8208;doping increases the air stability of n&#8208;dopants and permits n&#8208;dopants to be co&#8208;processed with polymer FBDPPV noninteractively before heating in air.







Abstract
Molecular doping plays an important role in the modification of carrier density of organic semiconductors thus enhancing their optoelectronic performance. However, efficient n&#8208;doping remains challenging, especially owing to the lack of strongly reducing and air&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Herein, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor, DMImC, is developed as a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with the excellent stability in air. Its thermolysis in situ regenerates free NHC and subsequently dopes typical organic semiconductors. In sequentially doped FBDPPV films, DMImC does not disturb the &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing of the polymer and achieves good miscibility with the polymer. As a result, a high electrical conductivity of up to 8.4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is obtained. Additionally, the thermally activated doping and the excellent air stability permit DMImC to be noninteractively co&#8208;processed with polymers in air. Our results reveal that DMImC can be served as an efficient n&#8208;dopant suitable for various organic semiconductors.

         <title>Modifying Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Stereoselectivity Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5712-5717, March 8, 2021. </description>

Vacuum&#8208;field strong coupling with molecular vibrations imposes symmetry constraints which alter the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann selectivity of cyclobutene ring opening under thermal conditions.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has recently been shown to change the rate and chemoselectivity of ground&#8208;state chemical reactions via the formation of light&#8211;matter hybrid polaritonic states. However, the observation that vibrational&#8208;mode symmetry has a large influence on charge&#8208;transfer reactions under VSC suggests that symmetry considerations could be used to control other types of chemical selectivity through VSC. Here, we show that VSC influences the stereoselectivity of the thermal electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene derivative, a reaction which follows the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. The direction of the change in stereoselectivity depends on the vibrational mode that is coupled, as do changes in rate and reaction thermodynamics. These results on pericyclic reactions confirm that symmetry plays a key role in chemistry under VSC.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Reductase Can Catalyze Ester Synthesis in Aqueous Environments</title>

An efficient and green method is presented for the synthesis of esters using carboxylic acid reductase as a biocatalyst under mild aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Most of the well&#8208;known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity. This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR), an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg2+, and NADPH as co&#8208;substrates. When NADPH was replaced by a nucleophilic alcohol, CAR from Mycobacterium marinum can catalyze esterification under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Addition of imidazole, especially at pH&#8197;10.0, significantly enhanced ester production. In comparison to other esterification enzymes such as acyltransferase and lipase, CAR gave higher esterification yields in direct esterification under aqueous conditions. The scalability of CAR catalyzed esterification was demonstrated for the synthesis of cinoxate, an active ingredient in sunscreen. The CAR esterification offers a new method for green esterification under high water content conditions.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Exciton Migration in Coassemblies: Achieving High Photostability without Disrupting the Electron Donation of Fluorene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5827-5832, March 8, 2021. </description>

Long&#8208;range exciton migration in coassembled superstructural microspheres (SMS) leads to embedding a small number of energy acceptors to afford efficient energy communication with energy donors, which not only creates high photostability but also preserves the properties of energy donors. The advantages of the coassembled SMS are illustrated in the sensitive fluorescence detection of trace explosives.







Abstract
In this work, photostable coassemblies from a nonphotostable fluorene oligomer (the energy donor) and a photostable oligomer (the energy acceptor) are fabricated. Long&#8208;range exciton migration over a net distance of about 370 energy&#8208;donor molecules to energy acceptors is demonstrated in such coassemblies. The fast and long energy migration allows harvesting of the excitation energy of energy donors by embedding a small number of energy acceptors for photostability enhancement. Importantly, embedding a small number of energy acceptors in coassemblies causes a negligible negative influence on the electron donation of energy donors that are desired in practical applications. The advantages of the coassemblies fabricated, that is, high photostability without disrupting the electron donation of energy donors, are well illustrated in fluorescence detection of trace explosives where prolonged working life and improved detection capacity are achieved.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) or Quasi&#8208;2D Superstructures from DNA&#8208;Coated Colloidal Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5744-5748, March 8, 2021. </description>

Colloidal 2D superstructures such as orthogonal packed single or double layers, flower&#8208;like Kagome, honeycomb structures, brick&#8208;wall like monolayer, and wrinkled monolayer can be assembled from DNA&#8208;coated di&#8208;patch particles in a bottom&#8208;up fashion.







Abstract
This contribution describes the synthesis of colloidal di&#8208;patch particles functionalized with DNA on the patches and their assembly into colloidal superstructures via cooperative depletion and DNA&#8208;mediated interactions. The assembly into flower&#8208;like Kagome, brick&#8208;wall like monolayer, orthogonal packed single or double layers, wrinkled monolayer, and colloidal honeycomb superstructures can be controlled by tuning the particles&#8217; patch sizes and assembly conditions. Based on these experimental results, we generate an empirical phase diagram. The principles revealed by the phase diagram provide guidance in the design of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with desired superstructures. Our strategy might be translatable to the assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) colloidal structures.

H2S(NtBu)4 was synthesized, isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray charge density analysis. The topological parameters &#961;(r), &#8711;2&#961;(r), and &#1013; characterize the two different amido S&#8722;N(H)tBu and imido S&#8722;NtBu bonds as strongly polarized single bonds. The entire SN4 unit can easily adapt to different electronic requirements.







Abstract
The valence isoelectronic imido analog H2S(NtBu)4 (1) of sulfuric acid H2SO4 was synthesized, isolated, and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray charge density analysis. The latter reveals strongly polarized S&#948;+&#8722;N&#948;&#8722; bonds with virtually no double bond character. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;polarize S&#8722;N bonds are an advantageous and versatile feature of sulfur nitrogen ligands, which enables them to adapt to different electron requirements of various metal cations.

         <title>Reactivity and Mechanisms of Photoactivated Heterometallic [RuIINiII] and [RuIINiIIRuII] Catalysts for Dihydrogen Generation from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5723-5728, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterometallic photocatalysts were probed for water reduction. While the bimetallic [RuIINiII] requires an external photosensitizer to be catalytic, the trinuclear heterometallic [RuIINiIIRuII] produces dihydrogen when irradiated with blue light. Mechanisms are proposed to account for these observations.







Abstract
Two heterometallic photocatalysts were designed and probed for water reduction. Both [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L1)](ClO4)2 (1) and [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L2)2RuII(bpy)2](ClO4)2 (2) can generate the low&#8208;valent precursor involved in hydride formation prior to dihydrogen generation. However, while the bimetallic [RuIINiII] (1) requires the presence of an external photosensitizer to trigger catalytic activity, the trimetallic [RuIINiIIRuII] (2) displays significant coupling between the catalytic and light&#8208;harvesting units to promote intramolecular multielectron transfer and perform photocatalysis at the Ni center. A concerted experimental and theoretical effort proposes mechanisms to explain why 1 is unable to achieve self&#8208;supported catalysis, while 2 is fully photocatalytic.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirooxindoles by Oxidative Rearrangement of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5871-5875, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic asymmetric oxidative rearrangement of indoles to oxindoles with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. This process is particularly powerful for the assembly of enantioenriched spirooxindoles, a privileged core structure of natural products.







Abstract
Oxidative rearrangement of indoles to access oxindoles has been used as a key step in complex molecule synthesis. We report a catalytic enantioselective variant of this transformation by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis, providing rapid access to a range of enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The high enantioselectivity is controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution.

         <title>Coal&#8208;Tar Dye&#8208;based Coordination Cages and Helicates</title>

A family of classic organic dyes, known since the advent of modern chemistry, was integrated into 3&#8208;dimensional, self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;objects via a novel piperazine&#8208;based linker strategy that conserves the auxochromic substituents. The dynamic nature of the lantern&#8208;shaped cages and helicates allows to recognize enantiopure guests via chirality transfer to the host, detected by circular dichroism response far in the visible region.







Abstract
A strategy to implement four members of the classic coal&#8208;tar dye family, Michler's ketone, methylene blue, rhodamine&#8197;B, and crystal violet, into [Pd2L4] self&#8208;assemblies is introduced. Chromophores were incorporated into bis&#8208;monodentate ligands using piperazine linkers that allow to retain the auxochromic dialkyl amine functionalities required for intense colors deep in the visible spectrum. Upon palladium coordination, ligands with pyridine donors form lantern&#8208;shaped dinuclear cages while quinoline donors lead to strongly twisted [Pd2L4] helicates in solution. In one case, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed rearrangement to a [Pd3L6] ring structure in the solid state. For nine examined derivatives, showing colors from yellow to deep violet, CD spectroscopy discloses different degrees of chiral induction by an enantiomerically pure guest. Ion mobility mass spectrometry allows to distinguish two binding modes. Self&#8208;assemblies based on this new ligand class promise application in chiroptical recognition, photo&#8208;redox catalysis and optical materials.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Photoactive Polymers on a Living Cell Surface via Bio&#8208;Palladium Catalysis for Modulating Biological Functions</title>

An in situ polymerization strategy to modify cell surface with conjugated polymers was developed by a bio&#8208;Pd nanoparticle catalyst on a cell surface. Polyphenyleneethynylene formed in&#8197;situ traces the polymerization process, exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli, and augments the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa.







Abstract
Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. Here, a bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy was developed for in&#8197;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8197;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. It can also augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. With this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be synthesized in&#8197;situ on the living cell surface.

Iridium Allyl Pair! Herein, we describe a Cp*IrIII&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective and redox&#8208;neutral alkynylation of unactivated olefins with bromoalkynes via allylic C&#8722;H activation. This undirected C&#8722;H functionalization outperformed other typically used directing groups, including ketone, ester and strongly coordinating oxime.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Cp*IrIII&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective and redox&#8208;neutral protocol for the construction of 1,4&#8208;enynes from unactivated olefins and bromoalkynes via intermolecular allylic C&#8722;H alkynylation. The developed mild reaction conditions tolerate a broad range of common functional groups, even enabling selective alkynylation of allylic C&#8722;H bonds in the presence of other prominent directing groups. Mechanistic experiments including the isolation of a catalytically active IrIII&#8208;allyl species support an intermolecular allylic C&#8722;H activation followed by an electrophilic alkynylation.

         <title>Transition of the Reaction from Three&#8208;Phase to Two&#8208;Phase by Using a Hybrid Conductor for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density High&#8208;Rate Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

A hybrid electronic and ionic conductor was proposed to build a solid&#8208;state air electrode that transforms the solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase to a two&#8208;phase process and further enhances the battery performance. The electrochemical effect of the hybrid conductor was shown by an in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy process.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 batteries possess the ability to deliver high energy density with enhanced safety. However, designing a highly functional solid&#8208;state air electrode is the main bottleneck for its further development. Herein, we adopt a hybrid electronic and ionic conductor to build solid&#8208;state air electrode that makes the transition of Li&#8208;O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase process to a two&#8208;phase process. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 battery with this hybrid conductor solid&#8208;state air electrode shows decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced reaction kinetics. The Coulombic efficiency of Li&#8208;O2 battery is also significantly improved, benefiting from the good contact between discharge products and electrode materials. In&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy under oxygen was used to illustrate the reversible deposition and decomposition of discharge products on the surface of this hybrid conductor, visually verifying the two&#8208;phase reaction.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Selective siRNA Delivery Using Glycosylated Dynamic Covalent Polymers Self&#8208;Assembled In&#8197;Situ by RNA Templating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5783-5787, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymers are expressed at low concentration by siRNA templating from peptide&#8208;based dynamic covalent libraries. Using a glycosylated building block, we show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent libraries enable exploring complex chemical systems from which bioactive assemblies can adaptively emerge through template effects. In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA acts as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding. Using a glycosylated building block, we were able to show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Skipped Enynes via C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkynylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>

Non&#8208;activated olefins react with TIPS&#8208;bromoacetylene under directing group&#8208;free RhIII catalysis to afford 1,4&#8208;enynes in a linear&#8208;selective fashion. The developed protocol performs on mild conditions and a vast array of functional groups are tolerated, including weak aryl&#8208;directing groups and disubstituted olefins, where no over functionalization is observed. Additionally, &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides provide Z&#8208;enynes and E&#8208; enediynes.







Abstract
The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H alkynylation of non&#8208;activated terminal alkenes leads selectively to linear 1,4&#8208;enynes at room&#8208;temperature. The catalytic system tolerates a wide range of functional groups without competing functionalization at other positions. Similarly, the vinylic C&#8722;H alkynylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208; unsaturated amides gives conjugated Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes and E&#8208;enediynes.

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Aluminum Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5794-5799, March 8, 2021. </description>

A highly rechargeable aqueous aluminum&#8208;organic battery system based on phenazine has been developed. The phenazine cathode undergoes a reversible electrochemical redox with high structural stability to accommodate the large&#8208;size aluminum&#8208;complex ions (de)insertion, and shows a strikingly stable aluminum storage capacity for promising large&#8208;scale energy applications.







Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al3+ ions (de)insertion mechanism. However, the strong electrostatic forces between Al3+ and the host materials usually lead to sluggish kinetics, poor reversibility and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox&#8208;active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large&#8208;size Al&#8208;complex co&#8208;intercalation through reversible redox active centers (&#8208;C=N&#8208;) of PZ. This co&#8208;intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs. This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.

This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Polycarboxylate Rhodium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) and their use as Building Blocks for Highly Connected Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5729-5733, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different post&#8208;synthetic routes have been followed to functionalize pre&#8208;synthesized RhII&#8208;based cuboctahedral metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with carboxylic acid groups, either on their 12&#8197;metal sites (vertices) or on their 24&#8197;linkers (edges). Such isolated MOPs serve as highly connected (12&#8208;c and 24&#8208;c) supermolecular building blocks, for the formation of two new bimetallic RhCu&#8208;MOF structures.







Abstract
Use of preformed metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs. Herein we report the use of polycarboxylate cuboctahedral RhII&#8208;MOPs for constructing highly&#8208;connected MOFs. Cuboctahedral MOPs were functionalized with carboxylic acid groups on their 12 vertices or 24 edges through coordinative or covalent post&#8208;synthetic routes, respectively. We then used each isolated polycarboxylate RhII&#8208;MOP as 12&#8208;c cuboctahedral or 24&#8208;c rhombicuboctahedral SBBs that, upon linkage with metallic secondary building units (SBUs), afford bimetallic highly&#8208;connected MOFs. The assembly of a pre&#8208;synthesized 12&#8208;c SBB with a 4&#8208;c paddle&#8208;wheel SBU, and a 24&#8208;c SBB with a 3&#8208;c triangular CuII SBU gave rise to bimetallic MOFs having ftw (4,12)&#8208;c or rht (3,24)&#8208;c topologies, respectively.

         <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxy Intermediates in the Bifunctional Mechanism of the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>

HOR on Au@PtNi surfaces in alkaline media has been investigated by in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (see picture). Direct spectroscopic evidence for OHad species was observed and further confirmed by deuterium isotopic experiments and DFT.







Abstract
Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells. However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism owing to a lack of direct in situ evidence of intermediates. In this study, in situ electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and DFT were used to study HOR processes on PtNi alloy and Pt surfaces, respectively. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxy species (OHad) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OHad species were not observed on the Pt surface during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxy adsorption on the platinum&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxy adsorption. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.

A series of analogous mixed matrix membranes with self&#8208;assembled interface pathways were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;scale ethylene/ethane (0.416&#8197;nm/0.443&#8197;nm) separation. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and the self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed.







Abstract
The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub&#8208;angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Herein, a series of analogous mixed matrix membrane (AMMMs) were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom scale ethylene/ethane (0.416&#8197;nm/0.443&#8197;nm) separation. With a small number of GQDs (3.5&#8197;wt%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1&#8208;fold, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60&#8201;% and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non&#8208;covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self&#8208;assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity.

         <title>Paired Copper Monomers in Zeolite Omega: The Active Site for Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5854-5858, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction along with support from theory and other X&#8208;ray techniques, the active copper site for methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion in zeolite omega has been determined spatially and quantitatively.







Abstract
The direct conversion of methane to methanol using oxygen is a challenging but potentially rewarding pathway towards utilizing methane. By using a stepwise chemical looping approach, copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites can convert methane to methanol, but productivity is still too low for viable implementation. However, if the nature of the active site could be elucidated, that information could be used to design more effective catalysts. By employing anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with support from theory and other X&#8208;ray techniques, we have derived a quantitative and spatial description of the highly selective, active copper sites in zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega). This is the first comprehensive description of the structure of non&#8208;copper&#8208;oxo active species and will provide a pivotal model for future development for materials for methane to methanol conversion.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Dynamic DNA&#8208;Origami&#8208;Based Plasmonic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5859-5863, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial configuration and optical properties of non&#8208;photoresponsive DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based plasmonic assemblies can be controlled with light using a photoresponsive medium. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium's pH decreases, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links in the plasmonic assemblies, leading to their spatial reconfiguration, which can be reversed by turning the light off.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA&#8208;based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Herein, we describe the remote manipulation of native (non&#8208;photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine&#8208;based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic, remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;The spatial configuration and optical properties of non&#8208;photoresponsive DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based plasmonic assemblies can be controlled with light using a photoresponsive medium. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium's pH decreases, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links in the plasmonic assemblies, leading to their spatial reconfiguration, which can be reversed by turning the light off.

         <title>The Smelling Principle of Vetiver Oil, Unveiled by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5666-5672, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the advance of modern analytic techniques, the smelling principle of vetiver oil is still unknown owing to its extremely complex matrix of over 150&#8197;compounds. A concise stereoselective total synthesis proves (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one to be the key to the quasi&#8208;pheromone&#8208;like aura of vetiver that magically resembles the effect of Iso&#8197;E&#8197;Super.







Abstract
Vetiver oil, produced on a multiton&#8208;scale from the roots of vetiver grass, is one of the finest and most popular perfumery materials, appearing in over a third of all fragrances. It is a complex mixture of hundreds of molecules and the specific odorant, responsible for its characteristic suave and sweet transparent, woody&#8208;ambery smell, has remained a mystery until today. Herein, we prove by an eleven&#8208;step chemical synthesis, employing a novel asymmetric organocatalytic Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael addition, that (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one is the active smelling principle of vetiver oil. Its olfactory evaluation reveals a remarkable odor threshold of 29&#8197;picograms per liter air, responsible for the special sensuous aura it lends to perfumes and the quasi&#8208;pheromone&#8208;like effect it has on perfumers and consumers alike.

         <title>A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in Vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity Against Tumours</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5699-5703, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo detection of natural killer (NK) cell activity against tumours was achieved with an activatable chemiluminescent probe containing a granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;reactive peptide substrate linked to a phenoxydioxetane scaffold through a p&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol linker. The rapid and specific chemiluminescence response of the probe was used to detect NK cell activity against breast cancer cells in living mice.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that can kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti&#8208;tumour activity of NK cells in&#8197;vivo. Herein, we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image in&#8197;situ the granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence. The probe shows high selectivity for active granzyme&#8197;B over other proteases and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios than commercial fluorophores. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe can detect NK cell activity in mouse models, being the first chemiluminescent probe for in&#8197;vivo imaging of NK cell activity in live tumours.

         <title>Na3SO4H&#8212;The First Representative of the Material Class of Sulfate Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5683-5687, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel sulfate hydride&#8212;the first representative of a new compound class&#8212;has been prepared by precise reaction control. A number of different methods, including neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, solid state MAS NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, and density functional calculations, were applied.







Abstract
The first representative of a novel class of mixed&#8208;anionic compounds, the sulfate hydride Na3SO4H, and the corresponding deuteride Na3SO4D were obtained from the solid&#8208;state reaction of NaH or NaD with dry Na2SO4. Precise reaction control is required, because too harsh conditions lead to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. A combined X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction study revealed that the compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/nmm with the lattice parameters a=7.0034(2)&#8197;&#197; and c=4.8569(2)&#8197;&#197;. The sole presence of hydride and absence of hydroxide ions is proven by vibrational spectroscopy and comparison with spectra predicted from quantum chemical calculations. 1H and 23Na MAS NMR spectra are consistent with the structure of Na3SO4H: a single 1H&#8197;peak at 2.9&#8197;ppm is observed, while two peaks at 15.0 and 6.2&#8197;ppm for the inequivalent 23Na&#8197;sites are observed. Elemental analysis and quantum chemical calculations further support these results.

         <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5771-5777, March 8, 2021. </description>

Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. They exhibited the highest mass activity among all non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in our best knowledge as well as a superb hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction performance in alkaline solution.







Abstract
Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen&#8208;oxidation and hydrogen&#8208;evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni&#8208;based materials are the only non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but they generally suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The final product exhibits an apparent hydrogen&#8208;oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and a record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 50&#8197;mV. A superior hydrogen&#8208;evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.

Both electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides reacted with potassium diorganophosphinites through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction. Even substantially stabilized anionic P&#8197;nucleophiles reacted to form the corresponding tertiary phosphine oxides. Quantum chemical calculations suggested a nucleophile&#8208;dependent mechanism involving both concerted and stepwise SNAr reaction pathways (see scheme).

Non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides reacted with potassium diorganophosphinites through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction. Remarkably, both electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides participated in the reaction with substantially stabilized anionic P&#8197;nucleophiles to form the corresponding tertiary phosphine oxides.

         <title>Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage Using Electrodeposited Manganese Oxides</title>

NH4+ storage using electrodeposited manganese oxides (MnOx) is studied for the first time. MnOx exhibits structural transformation during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion in layered MnOx is associated with hydrogen&#8208;bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers.







Abstract
NH4+ ions as charge carriers show potential for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Studied here for the first time is the NH4+&#8208;storage chemistry using electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx experiences morphology and phase transformations during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+ storage for MnOx. The transformed MnOx with a layered structure delivers a high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibits good cycling stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M NH4Ac, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+ migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations show that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers. These findings provide a new prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contributes to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+&#8208;storage mechanism for metal oxides.

         <title>Tunable eg Orbital Occupancy in Heusler Compounds for Oxygen Evolution Reaction**

Heusler compounds (Co2YZ) with mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions, are studied as a new class of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The eg orbital filling of active Co sites was precisely regulated by varying the Y and Z sites of the Co2YZ compounds, where the higher catalytic current was achieved for eg orbital filling approaching unity.







Abstract
Heusler compounds have potential in electrocatalysis because of their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co2YZ&#8208;type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co2YZ crystals was synthesized through the arc&#8208;melting method and the eg orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying Y and Z sites of the compound. A correlation between the eg orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found for Co2MnZ compounds (Z=Ti, Al, V, and Ga), whereby higher catalytic current was achieved for eg orbital filling approaching unity. A similar trend of eg orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other Heusler compounds (Co2VZ, Z=Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept in the application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalysts, and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performance.

         <title>Cysteine Nucleophiles in Glycosidase Catalysis: Application of a Covalent &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Arabinofuranosidase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5754-5758, March 8, 2021. </description>

&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidases are thought to make use of a unique zinc&#8208;associated cysteine nucleophile to catalyze glycoside hydrolysis. Using a bespoke synthetic covalent inhibitor, this proposed mechanism is put to the test. Mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and mechanistic simulations support the formation of a thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate and reveal how the enzyme facilitates CS bond cleavage.







Abstract
The recent discovery of zinc&#8208;dependent retaining glycoside hydrolases (GHs), with active sites built around a Zn(Cys)3(Glu) coordination complex, has presented unresolved mechanistic questions. In particular, the proposed mechanism, depending on a Zn&#8208;coordinated cysteine nucleophile and passing through a thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate, remains controversial. This is primarily due to the expected stability of the intermediate C&#8722;S bond. To facilitate the study of this atypical mechanism, we report the synthesis of a cyclophellitol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidase inhibitor, hypothesised to react with the catalytic nucleophile to form a non&#8208;hydrolysable adduct analogous to the mechanistic covalent intermediate. This &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidase inhibitor reacts exclusively with the proposed cysteine thiol catalytic nucleophiles of representatives of GH families 127 and 146. X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined for the resulting adducts enable MD and QM/MM simulations, which provide insight into the mechanism of thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate breakdown. Leveraging the unique chemistry of cyclophellitol derivatives, the structures and simulations presented here support the assignment of a zinc&#8208;coordinated cysteine as the catalytic nucleophile and illuminate the finely tuned energetics of this remarkable metalloenzyme clan.

         <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5833-5837, March 8, 2021. </description>

Anomalous small&#8208;angle scattering measurements accurately and quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of counterions around a rigid, spherical charged cluster {Mo132}42&#8722;, which reveal the secret behind the unusual high solubility of {Mo132} with divalent counterions in comparison to the monovalent ones.







Abstract
The accurate distribution of countercations (Rb+ and Sr2+) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo132}42&#8722;, is determined by anomalous small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Both Rb+ and Sr2+ ions lead to shorter diffuse lengths for {Mo132} than prediction. Most Rb+ ions are closely associated with {Mo132} by staying near the skeleton of {Mo132} or in the Stern layer, whereas more Sr2+ ions loosely associate with {Mo132} in the diffuse layer. The stronger affinity of Rb+ ions towards {Mo132} than that of Sr2+ ions explains the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration of {Mo132} with Rb+ compared to Sr2+. The anomalous behavior of {Mo132} can be attributed to majority of negative charges being located at the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8211;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction, making the enthalpy change owing to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8211;{Mo132} interaction.

         <title>Fe&#8208;O Clusters Anchored on Nodes of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Direct Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5811-5815, March 8, 2021. </description>

Fe&#8208;O clusters are synthesized on nodes of UiO&#8208;66 simultaneously coordinated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or acetic acid (AA) for direct methane oxidation. The TFA group coordinated with Zr6 node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster, promotes the activation of C&#8722;H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion into C1 oxygenates.







Abstract
Direct methane oxidation into value&#8208;added organic oxygenates with high productivity under mild condition remains a great challenge. We show Fe&#8208;O clusters on nodes of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronic state for direct methane oxidation into C1 organic oxygenates at 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fe&#8208;O clusters are grafted onto inorganic Zr6 nodes of UiO&#8208;66, while the organic terephthalic acid (H2BDC) ligands of UiO&#8208;66 are partially substituted with monocarboxylic modulators of acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr6 node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster due to its electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C&#8722;H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% selectivity, circa 8 times higher than those modulated with AA.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Light&#8208;Controlled Molecular Encapsulation and Release</title>

A series of azobenzene&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes 1, 2 and 3 is synthesized. Light&#8208;controlled molecular encapsulation and release are realized based on macrocycle 1.







Abstract
Azobenzene (azo)&#8208;based macrocycles are highly fascinating in supramolecular chemistry because of their light&#8208;responsiveness. In this work, a series of azo&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes 1, 2, 3, and 4, distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups, is rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment&#8208;cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of 1, 2, and 3, we observe that the cavity size of these azo&#8208;macrocycles decreases gradually upon E&#8594;Z photoisomerization. Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle 1 and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular&#8208;encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.

Rotational spectra of intermolecular clusters involving S&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C/N/O interactions reveal the structural and energetic features of disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds, providing a deep insight into molecular behaviors of the disulfide bond towards a hydrogen donor at the molecular level.







Abstract
The disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2O/H2CO/HCONH2 clusters were characterized by high&#8208;resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2O/HCONH2 clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.

         <title>Highly Potent MRI Contrast Agent Displaying Outstanding Sensitivity to Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5734-5738, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent MRI contrast agent based on paramagnetic Gd3+ was developed to selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions. The interaction with Zn2+ modulates the hydration of the complex, leading to a significant increase in its longitudinal relaxivity. The new responsive platform is highly suitable for studying the Zn&#8208;related physiological processes at high magnetic fields.







Abstract
Zinc ions play an important role in numerous crucial biological processes in the human body. The ability to image the function of Zn2+ would be a significant asset to biomedical research for monitoring various physiopathologies dependent on its fate. To this end, we developed a novel Gd3+ chelate that can selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions and alter its paramagnetic properties. More specifically, this lanthanide chelate displayed an extraordinary increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of over 400&#8201;% upon interaction with Zn2+ at 7&#8197;T and 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is the greatest r1 enhancement observed for any of the metal ion&#8208;responsive Gd&#8208;based complexes at high magnetic field. A &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; mechanism responsible for these massive changes was confirmed through NMR and luminescence lifetime studies on a 13C&#8208;labeled Eu3+ analogue. This molecular platform represents a new momentum in developing highly suitable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for functional molecular imaging studies of Zn2+.

&lt;p&gt;A highly potent MRI contrast agent based on paramagnetic Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was developed to selectively recognize Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; over other abundant endogenous metal ions. The interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modulates the hydration of the complex, leading to a significant increase in its longitudinal relaxivity. The new responsive platform is highly suitable for studying the Zn&#8208;related physiological processes at high magnetic fields.

         <title>Diols Activation by Cu/Borinic Acids Synergistic Catalysis in Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclic Diaryliodoniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5788-5793, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work describes the copper and borinic acid cooperatively catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums and diols. Upon fine&#8208;tuning the structure of boronic acids, the selective activation of 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diols was successfully realized.







Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening alkoxygenation reaction of cyclic diaryliodonium salts and diols in the presence of borinic acids was reported. Tuning structure of borinic acids with six or five&#8208;membered ring skeleton could selectively activate 1,2&#8208;diols or 1,4&#8208;diols. A catalytic cycle through a key ion pair model that accounts for the observed enantioselectivity was proposed.

A Pd0&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective [3+2] spiroannulation reaction has been developed for rapid assembly of [5,5] spirocyclic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The regioselectivity could be dominated by fine&#8208;tuning the Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate. An array of coupling partners could be well&#8208;tolerated with excellent regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Potential application of the reaction was exemplified by several further transformations.

Unbiased methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at the position &#946; to a nitrogen center were borylated in an enantioselective manner in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand and an iridium precursor (see scheme).

         <title>A Systematic Study of Unsaturation in Lipid Nanoparticles Leads to Improved mRNA Transfection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5848-5853, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsaturated amino lipids were synthesized to study the role of unsaturation in lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery. A lipid series with a Citronellol tail (4A3&#8208;Cit) was identified from a library screen. Employing 4A3&#8208;Cit in new Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) formulation resulted in an 18&#8208;fold increase in mRNA expression over saturated LNPs. The findings provide insights into how unsaturation and SORT mixing can promote mRNA delivery.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the leading concept for mRNA delivery. Unsaturated lipids play important roles in nature with potential for mRNA therapeutics, but are difficult to access through chemical synthesis. To systematically study the role of unsaturation, modular reactions were utilized to access a library of 91 amino lipids, enabled by the synthesis of unsaturated thiols. An ionizable lipid series (4A3) emerged from in vitro and in vivo screening, where the 4A3 core with a citronellol&#8208;based (Cit) periphery emerged as best. We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3&#8208;Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3&#8208;Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo through Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18&#8208;fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.

         <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively.







Abstract
Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin&#8197;A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin&#8197;A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD.

     alt="One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting enzymes, a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin&#8197;A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin&#8197;A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unprecedented 2D Homochiral Hybrid Lead&#8208;Iodide Perovskite Thermochromic Ferroelectrics with Ferroelastic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead&#8208;iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 by the chemical design of introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N&#8208;benzylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2 type paraelectric&#8208;ferroelectric behavior at around 378 K coupled with clear ferroelastic domains &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange&#8208;yellow to orange&#8208;red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented. This finding offers a resultful path to design chiral perovskite ferroelectrics and is of great inspiration to the discovery of multifunctional perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols via Desymmetrization of gem&#8208;Dimethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral RhIII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective methyl C&#8722;H amidation via desymmetrization of gem&#8208;dimethyl groups afforded functionalized &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high enatioselectivity (&gt;30 examples, up to 92&#8201;% ee). The high enantioselectivity is ascribed to judicious choice of oxime directing groups, sterically biased gem&#8208;groups in the C&#8722;H substrate, and high reactivity of the iodonium imide reagents.







Abstract
Desymmetrization of gem&#8208;dimethyl groups en route to the rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H amidation is reported. Synthetically important &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives were accessed in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivity. The high enantioselectivity is enabled by an appropriate oxime directing group, sterically biased gem&#8208;groups in the C&#8722;H substrate, and high reactivity of the amidating reagent.

         <title>Unconventional Photocatalysis in Conductive Polymers: Reversible Modulation of PEDOT:PSS Conductivity by Long&#8208;Lived Poly(Heptazine Imide) Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive polymer (PEDOT:PSS) and potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI) are combined in one hybrid nanocomposite as electron donor and photocatalyst, respectively. The composite represents an example of unconventional photocatalysis: K&#8208;PHI modulates the physicochemical properties of the conductive polymer upon exposure to light and dark in different environments.







Abstract
In photocatalysis, small organic molecules are converted into desired products using light responsive materials, electromagnetic radiation, and electron mediators. Substitution of low molecular weight reagents with redox active functional materials may increase the utility of photocatalysis beyond organic synthesis and environmental applications. Guided by the general principles of photocatalysis, we design hybrid nanocomposites composed of n&#8208;type semiconducting potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), and p&#8208;type conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the redox active substrate. Electrical conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite, possessing optimal K&#8208;PHI content, is reversibly modulated combining a series of external stimuli ranging from visible light under inert conditions and to dark conditions under an O2 atmosphere. Using a conductive polymer as the redox active substrate allows study of the photocatalytic processes mediated by semiconducting photocatalysts through electrical conductivity measurements.

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptide&#8208;Cyanine Conjugates In Vivo as Fine&#8208;Tunable Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assemble into a one&#8208;dimensional column with controlled cyanine aggregation exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. Through rational molecular design, the assembly behavior of cyanine dyes is precisely regulated in biological systems, resulting in two kinds of assemblies with different properties. The relationship between structure and function has been studied in detail.







Abstract
The fabrication of functional assemblies with defined structures through controllable molecular packing under physiological conditions is challenging. Here, modularly designed peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assembly into 1D columnar superstructures with controlled cyanine aggregation were designed, and they exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. The peptide backbone is cleaved by caspase&#8208;3/7 after entering the cells. Then the self&#8208;assembled residue, with a double cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;2Cy), forms a P helical column in which H&#8208;aggregated cyanine dyes show 3.4&#8208;fold photothermal conversion efficiency compared to free ones. The self&#8208;assembled residue with a single cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;1Cy) forms a loose column, in which cyanine dyes with undefined structure have a fluorescence quantum yield of up to 9.5&#8201;% (emission at 819&#8197;nm in H2O). This work provides a simple way to modify in vivo self&#8208;assembled peptides with functional molecules for achieving desired bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Electrooxidative B&#8722;H Functionalization of nido&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical method for the direct B&#8722;H functionalization of nido&#8208;carboranes (7,8&#8208;nido&#8208;C2B9H12&#8722;) has been developed under electrochemical reaction conditions. In this reaction system, anodic oxidation serves as a green alternative for traditional chemical oxidants in the oxidation of nido&#8208;carboranes. Coupling nido&#8208;carboranes with thioethers, selenides, tellurides, N&#8208;heterocycles, phosphates, phosphines, arsenides and antimonides demonstrates high site&#8208;selectivity and efficiency.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical method for the direct B&#8722;H functionalization of nido&#8208;carboranes (7,8&#8208;nido&#8208;C2B9H12&#8722;) has been developed under electrochemical reaction conditions. In this reaction system, anodic oxidation serves as a green alternative for traditional chemical oxidants in the oxidation of nido&#8208;carboranes. No transition&#8208;metal catalyst is required and different heteroatoms bearing a lone pair are reactive in this transformation. Coupling nido&#8208;carboranes with thioethers, selenides, tellurides, N&#8208;heterocycles, phosphates, phosphines, arsenides and antimonides demonstrates high site&#8208;selectivity and efficiency. Importantly, nido&#8208;carboranes can be easily incorporated into drug motifs through this reaction protocol.

In this reaction system, anodic oxidation serves as a green alternative for traditional chemical oxidants in the oxidation of &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carboranes. No transition&#8208;metal catalyst is required and different heteroatoms bearing a lone pair are reactive in this transformation. Coupling &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carboranes with thioethers, selenides, tellurides, N&#8208;heterocycles, phosphates, phosphines, arsenides and antimonides demonstrates high site&#8208;selectivity and efficiency. Importantly, &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carboranes can be easily incorporated into drug motifs through this reaction protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Glutathione within Intracranial Tumors through Interlocked MRI Signals of a Responsive Nanoprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally simple and dimensionally small Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;based GSH responsive MRI probe can form particle aggregates within tumors in vivo to give rise to strong GSH concentration dependent interlocked relaxivities (R1 and R2). This probe was applied to the mapping of the heterogeneous distribution of GSH within an intracranial tumor in vivo.







Abstract
Studies reveal that malignant tumors feature uneven distributions of some key biomarkers across the entire tumorous region. Nevertheless, only very limited progress has been made towards non&#8208;invasive and quantitative detection of tumor&#8208;specific biomarkers in vivo, especially with clinically compatible imaging modalities. Reported here is an Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;based glutathione (GSH) responsive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe that can form particle aggregates within tumors in vivo to give rise to strong GSH concentration dependent interlocked relaxivities. A quantitative correlation between the interlocked MRI signals and local GSH concentration was established, and further applied for mapping the heterogeneous distribution of GSH within an intracranial tumor (2.4&#8197;mm &#215; 1.6&#8197;mm) in vivo. This methodology will offer a practical route for quantitatively mapping tumor&#8208;specific biomarkers in vivo with unlimited detection depth, which largely challenges optical&#8208;imaging&#8208;based approaches.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Controllable Synthesis of n&#8208;Specific Layered 2D Perovskite Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;phase 2D lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite nanoplates with a designated n value can be successfully prepared through kinetic control of the nucleation process. This approach can effectively avoid the multipeak photoluminescence generally observed in multilayer 2D perovskite nanomaterials.







Abstract
2D perovskites with chemical formula A&#8242;2An&#8722;1BnX3n+1 have recently attracted considerable attention due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, which can be attained by varying the chemical composition. While high color&#8208;purity emitting perovskite nanomaterials have been accomplished through changing the halide composition, the preparation of single&#8208;phase, specific n&#8208;layer 2D perovskite nanomaterials is still pending because of the fast nucleation process of nanoparticles. We demonstrate a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesizing single&#8208;phase 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskites through kinetic control. Casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium promotes selective formation of the kinetic product&#8212;multilayer 2D perovskite&#8212;in preference to the single&#8208;layer thermodynamic product. For the n&#8208;specific layered 2D perovskites, decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.

         <title>The Design of a GLP&#8208;1/PYY Dual Acting Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A GLP&#8208;1/PYY hybrid analogue of the two non&#8208;homologous peptides, GLP&#8208;1 and PYY, activating both GLP&#8208;1 and Y2 receptors that belongs to different receptor families, was designed and shown to have increased in vivo efficacy compared to the mono&#8208;agonist analogue versions in an acute food intake study in mice.







Abstract
The two gut hormones GLP&#8208;1 and PYY3&#8211;36, which are both secreted from the L&#8208;cells upon food stimuli, have a stronger inhibitory effect on food intake when they are combined, compared to their individual effects as single agonists. Although they are not homologous and share no sequence similarity, we show that a GLP&#8208;1 analogue can be designed to exhibit potent activity on both the Y2 and GLP&#8208;1 receptors. Dual acting hybrid analogues were realized by designing truncated and potent Y2 receptor PYY analogues, followed by integrating the critical residues into GLP&#8208;1. In this study, we show that one of these dual acting agonists acutely reduces food intake significantly more than the respective mono&#8208;agonist counterparts.

         <title>Hierarchy Control of MFI Zeolite Membrane towards Superior Butane Isomer Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through combining hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing, a hierarchical MFI zeolite membrane exhibiting superior n&#8208;/i&#8208;butane isomer separation performance was facilely prepared.







Abstract
Microstructural optimization (such as thickness and preferred orientation) is a major concern for performance enhancement of zeolite membranes. In this study, we demonstrated that the introduction of hierarchy easily enabled concurrent thickness reduction and orientation control of zeolite membranes. Specifically, hierarchical MFI zeolite membranes comprising higher degree of (h0h) preferentially oriented ultrathin (ca. 390&#8197;nm) selective top layers and porous intermediate layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 substrates were fabricated. The use of hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and the employment of single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing were found indispensable for the preparation of MFI zeolite membranes with superior butane isomer separation performance, thereby surpassing the current n&#8208;/i&#8208;butane selectivity versus n&#8208;butane permeance trade&#8208;off limits of MFI zeolite membranes prepared via solution&#8208;based synthetic protocols.

         <title>Non&#8208;oxidative Coupling of Methane: N&#8208;type Doping of Niobium Single Atoms in TiO2&#8211;SiO2 Induces Electron Localization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type doped macro/mesoporous TiO2&#8211;SiO2 was synthesized and applied to the photocatalytic NOCM. The n&#8208;type doping results in electronic localization in the neighborhood of Nb, which facilitates the activation of CH4 and the desorption of C2H6. More active sites formed from Nb doping and the facilitated adsorption&#8208;activation&#8208;coupling&#8208;desorption process finally result in the high activity of Nb&#8211;TS.







Abstract
Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) is an attractive potential way to use abundant methane resources. Herein, an n&#8208;type doped photocatalyst for NOCM is created by doping single&#8208;atom Nb into hierarchical porous TiO2&#8211;SiO2 (TS) microarray, which exhibits a high conversion rate of 3.57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with good recyclability. The Nb dopant replaces the 6&#8208;coordinated titanium on the (1 0 1) plane and forms shallow electron&#8208;trapped surface polarons along [0 1 0] direction and the comparison of different models proves that the electron localization caused by the n&#8208;type doping is beneficial to both methane activation and ethane desorption. The positive effect of n&#8208;type dopant on CH4 conversion is further verified on Mo&#8208;, W&#8208; and Ta&#8208;doped composites. In contrast, the doping of p&#8208;type dopant (Ga, Cu, Fe) shows a less active influence.

The n&#8208;type doping results in electronic localization in the neighborhood of Nb, which facilitates the activation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. More active sites formed from Nb doping and the facilitated adsorption&#8208;activation&#8208;coupling&#8208;desorption process finally result in the high activity of Nb&#8211;TS.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (NOCM) is an attractive potential way to use abundant methane resources. Herein, an n&#8208;type doped photocatalyst for NOCM is created by doping single&#8208;atom Nb into hierarchical porous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (TS) microarray, which exhibits a high conversion rate of 3.57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with good recyclability. The Nb dopant replaces the 6&#8208;coordinated titanium on the (1 0 1) plane and forms shallow electron&#8208;trapped surface polarons along [0 1 0] direction and the comparison of different models proves that the electron localization caused by the n&#8208;type doping is beneficial to both methane activation and ethane desorption. The positive effect of n&#8208;type dopant on CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion is further verified on Mo&#8208;, W&#8208; and Ta&#8208;doped composites. In contrast, the doping of p&#8208;type dopant (Ga, Cu, Fe) shows a less active influence.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Complementary Syntheses Giving Access to a Full Suite of Differentially Substituted Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pathways are proposed for the synthesis of an important class of functionalized phthalocyanine&#8208;porphyrin hybrids (TBTAPs). The materials are novel in their own right, but more importantly, the syntheses offer control and variation over structural and substituent modifications, a goal not yet achieved even within the extensively investigated chemistry of the parent phthalocyanines.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are often the scaffolds of choice for use in widespread applications. Synthetic advances allow bespoke derivatives to be made, tailoring their properties. The selective synthesis of unsymmetrical systems, particularly phthalocyanines, has remained a significant unmet challenge. Porphyrin&#8208;phthalocyanine hybrids offer the potential to combine the favorable features of both parent structures, but again synthetic strategies are poorly developed. Here we demonstrate strategies that give straightforward, controlled access to differentially substituted meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrabenzotriazaporphyrins by reaction between an aryl&#8208;aminoisoindolene (A) initiator and a complementary phthalonitrile (B). The choice of precursors and reaction conditions allows selective preparation of 1:3 Ar&#8208;ABBB and, uniquely, 2:2 Ar&#8208;ABBA functionalized hybrids.

         <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively. The esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD, as reported by Yudai Matsuda, Ikuro Abe et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016525).

         <title>Interplay Between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A foldarotaxane molecular architecture is reported by Yann Ferrand, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100349). It comprises a molecular axle encircled by a macrocycle and wrapped with a foldamer helix. Through its controlled localization, the macrocycle alters the association between the helix and the axle, while the helix compartmentalizes the molecular shuttle. In the picture and X&#8208;ray structure, the snake wraps itself around the tree branch and pushes that way the bulky surrounding wheel.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Assisted Lithium Ion Transport for High Performance PEO&#8209;based Ternary Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N   &#8208;alkyl&#8208;  N  &#8208;alkyl pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates as non&#8208;flammable plasticizers for lowering the operation temperature of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), but they present limitations in terms of lithium ion transport such as a much lower lithium transference number. Thus, a pyrrolidinium cation was prepared with an oligo(ethylene oxide) substituent with seven repeating units. We show, by a combination of experimental characterizations and simulations, that the cation&#8217;s solvating properties allow faster lithium ion transport than alkyl&#8209;substituted analogues when incorporated in SPEs. This proceeds not only by accelerating PEO own conduction modes, but also  via  the enabling new conduction modes linked to the solvation of lithium by a single IL cation. This, combined with favorable interfacial properties  vs  . lithium metal, leads to significantly improved performance on lithium metal polymer batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudo Natural Products &#8208; Chemical Evolution of Natural Product Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small bioactive molecules are powerful tools for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research. For their discovery, design principles and strategies that draw from previous insights into the structures of compound classes  a priori  endowed with biological relevance are particularly efficient, such as natural products (NPs). Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) combine natural product fragments in novel arrangements not accessible by current biosynthesis pathways. As such they can be regarded as non&#8208;biogenic fusions of NP&#8208;derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding NPs, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity.  We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven branch of the evolution of natural products, i.e. a chemical evolution of natural product structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Meroterpenoid Manginoid A as Fueled by a Challenging Pinacol Coupling and Bicycle&#8208;forming Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted  trans  &#8208;hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging Pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional chemo&#8208; and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets. &#160; As a result, not only has a 19&#8208;step total synthesis of manginoid A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical manipulation of subcellular protein translocation using a photoactivatable covalent labeling system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical tools to optically manipulate protein dynamics and functions can reveal cellular pathways with high spatiotemporal resolution. The photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) technique for tag&#8208;fused proteins is one of the most promising methods for regulating subcellular protein translocations and protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, light&#8208;induced covalent protein dimerization in living cells has yet to be established, despite its various advantages. Herein, we developed a photoactivatable covalent protein&#8208;labeling technology by applying a caged ligand to the BL&#8208;tag system, a covalent protein labeling system that uses mutant &#946;&#8208;lactamase. We further developed CBHD, a caged protein dimerizer, using caged BL&#8208;tag and HaloTag ligands, and achieved light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions. In addition, this covalent photo&#8208;CID system enabled quick protein translocation to a laser&#8208;illuminated microregion. These results indicate that the covalent photo&#8208;CID system will expand the scope of CID applications in the optical manipulation of cellular functions.</dc:description>

In this Article, we demonstrate the feasibility of reversing the stereoselectivity of such MBH&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by switching to a new pair of rearrangement partners consisting of aryl iodanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxazolines. As a result, the two protocols complement each other in approaching  E&#8208;  or  Z&#8208;  &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While two dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy is uniquely suitable for monitoring fs&#8208;ps water dynamics around static protein structures, its utility for probing enzyme active&#8208;site dynamics is limited, due to the lack of site&#8208;specific 2D&#8208;IR probes. In this work, we demonstrate the genetic incorporation of a novel 2D&#8208;IR probe, m&#8208;azido&#8208;tyrosine (N3Y) in the active&#8208;site of DddK, an iron dependent enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of dimethylsulfoniopropionate to dimethylsulphide. Our results show that both the oxidation of active&#8208;site iron to Fe(III), and the addition of denaturation reagents result in significant decrease in enzyme activity, and active&#8208;site  water motion confinement. As tyrosine residues play important roles including general acid, general base, and electron transfer in many key enzymes, the genetically encoded 2D&#8208;IR probe N3Y should be broadly applicable to investigate how the enzyme active&#8208;site motions at fs&#8208;ps time scale direct reactions pathways to facilitating specific chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective prebiotic synthesis of&#160;&#945;&#8208;threofuranosyl cytidine by photochemical anomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of life&#8217;s first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The &#8216;RNA world theory&#8217; suggests RNA was life&#8217;s first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding, stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and furanosyl&#8208;selective prebiotic synthesis of  threo&#8208;  cytidine  3,  an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine  1  . Furthermore, we demonstrate that  erythro  &#8208;specific 2',3'&#8208;cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Chemoselective Hydroboration of Isocyanates: Amide Bond Formation and C=O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a remarkable conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) supported zinc hydride, [{LZnH}2; L = {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8208;C=N&#8208;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar = 2,6&#8208;Et2&#8208;C6H3}] (I) catalyzed partial reduction of heteroallenes via hydroboration is reported. A large number of aryl and alkyl isocyanates, including electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups, undergo reduction to obtain selectively N&#8208;boryl formamide, bis(boryl) hemiaminal and N&#8208;boryl methyl amine products. The compound I effectively catalyzes the chemoselective reduction of various isocyanates, in which the construction of the amide bond occurs. Isocyanates undergo a deoxygenation hydroboration reaction, in which the C=O bond cleaves, leading to N&#8208;boryl methyl amines. Several functionalities such as nitro, cyano, halide, and alkene groups are well&#8208;tolerated. Furthermore, a series of kinetic, control experiments and structurally characterized intermediates suggest that the zinc hydride species are responsible for all reduction steps and breaking the C=O bond.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (~12&#160;panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole&#8208;based&#160;amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and&#160;coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant&#160;nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved&#160;electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric&#160;amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and&#160;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by&#160;the nanocapsule in water. In the cavity, a highly blue&#8208;shifted&#160;absorption band is observed from largely twisted coumarin dyes and&#160;two absorption bands are found from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion. Moreover, the encapsulated dimers exhibit unique excimer&#8208;like emission.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a universal method for biochemical and biomedical studies, including metabolomics, proteomics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By increasing the signal of selected molecules, the hyperpolarization of nuclear spins has expanded the reach of NMR and MRI even further (e.g. hyperpolarized solid&#8208;state NMR and metabolic imaging in vivo).  Para  hydrogen (pH  2  ) offers a fast and cost efficient way to achieve hyperpolarization, and the last decade has seen extensive advances including the synthesis of new tracers, catalysts, and transfer methods. The portfolio of hyperpolarized molecules now includes amino acids, which are of great interest for many applications. Here, we review the current literature and developments for the hyperpolarization of amino acids and peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting electrocatalytic activity of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides by ligand&#8208;induced conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  3d  transition metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications, which feature well&#8208;tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We hereby propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, in consideration of most  3d  metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The  3d  transition metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications, which feature well&#8208;tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We hereby propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, in consideration of most  3d  metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands effectively downshifts the  d  &#8208;band center, which on one side narrows the band gap and on the other side optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates.

         <title>Unravelling the Structure of a Medium&#8208;Sized Metalloid Gold Nanocluster and its Filming Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium&#8208;sized range by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix&#8208;structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate&#8208;universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversifying metal&#8208;ligand cooperative catalysis in semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial enzymes have been developed into novel biocatalysts and useful probes of enzyme mechanisms. However, artificial enzymes rarely operate by a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature mechanism for the native enzyme reactions. Here we describe the reconstitution of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases using a series of Mn(I) complexes. These complexes are specifically designed to either have an internal base or pro&#8208;base that may participate in metal&#8208;ligand cooperative catalysis, or have no internal base or pro&#8208;base. Only Mn(I) complexes with an internal base or pro&#8208;base are active for H2 activation. Only [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for H2 activation by both the Mn(I) complexes alone and by [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases. Due to the nature and position of the internal base or pro&#8208;base in the Mn(I) complexes, the mode of metal&#8208;ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One such [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This work demonstrates the reconstitution of active artificial hydrogenases using synthetic complexes that differ substantially from the native active site. This strategy might be applied to develop new biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Metallophthalocyanine Framework Films with High Carrier Mobility as Efficient Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor electrical conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. In this work, we developed a conductive metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework connected with the Co(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkage. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine endows this material with high electrical conductivity. In addition, the conductivity of NiPc&#8208;CoTAA can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework can be further fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000 nm using the steam&#8208;assisted conversion method. These films were utilized for the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This work not only indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based conductive frameworks in advanced stand&#8208;off chemical sensors, but also more significantly supplies a general strategy through the tailor&#8208;make molecular design to achieve sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We develop a database of acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithm. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well&#8208;defined reactivity and promotors were organized and processed by the designed software program &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; for prediction of glycosylation reaction without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.</dc:description>

         <title>Protic Ionic Liquid as Reagent, Catalyst, and Solvent: 1&#8208;Methylimidazolium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A resplendent trio: Protic ionic liquids (PILs) with nucleophilic anions served in concert as regenerable reaction medium, Br&#248;nsted acid, and a source of nucleophile. Heating of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes with 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate (B:&#8901;HNCS) afforded products of formal (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of isothiocyanic acid.







Abstract
We propose a new concept of the triple role of protic ionic liquids with nucleophilic anions: a) a regenerable solvent, b) a Br&#248;nsted acid inducing diverse transformations via general acid catalysis, and c) a source of a nucleophile. The efficiency of this strategy was demonstrated using thiocyanate&#8208;based protic ionic liquids for the ring&#8208;opening of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. A wide variety of activated cyclopropanes were found to react with 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate under mild metal&#8208;free conditions via unusual nitrogen attack of the ambident thiocyanate ion on the electrophilic center of the three&#8208;membered ring affording pyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones bearing donor and acceptor substituents at the C(5) and C(3) atoms, respectively, in a single time&#8208;efficient step. The ability of 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate to serve as a triplex reagent was exemplarily illustrated by (4+2)&#8208;annulation with 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)cyclopropane, epoxide ring&#8208;opening and other organic transformations.

         <title>A Palette of Minimally Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;Time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a chemical strategy to prepare sucrose derivatives with vibrational tags and the characterisation of the first optical analogue of sucrose able to image real&#8208;time trafficking of sucrose in live plant cells.







Abstract
Sucrose is the main saccharide used for long&#8208;distance transport in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (&#8776;50&#8197;Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound 6 as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives.

     alt="A Palette of Minimally Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;Time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a chemical strategy to prepare sucrose derivatives with vibrational tags and the characterisation of the first optical analogue of sucrose able to image real&#8208;time trafficking of sucrose in live plant cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucrose is the main saccharide used for long&#8208;distance transport in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (&#8776;50&#8197;Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein, we demonstrate the application of compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Low&#8208;Coordinate Single&#8208;Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to construct single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted as Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on defective carbon supports derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served as an electrocatalyst, the Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst, with lower N coordination number around Ni atoms, achieves superior catalytic performance for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination microenvironment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on pre&#8208;designed N&#8208;doped carbon derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C shows excellent performance in Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to coordination microenvironment modulation (MEM) of SACs for CO2 utilization.

         <title>Prevent or Cure&#8212;The Unprecedented Need for Self&#8208;Reporting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials, and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, for example, prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self&#8208;healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self&#8208;reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self&#8208;reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self&#8208;reporting systems, the recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self&#8208;reporting fashion.

         <title>Dimeric Cycloparaphenylenes with a Rigid Aromatic Linker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three cycloparaphenylene (CPP) dimers with rigid aromatic linker were synthesized from an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. The structures of those giant molecules are in rapid interconversion between cis and trans conformations. In solution, they emit brightly beyond 600&#8197;nm with quantum yield up to 80&#8201;%. Having two CPP rings within one molecule, the first 1:2 complex with C60 is constructed.







Abstract
Dimeric cycloparaphenylene (CPP) architectures with well&#8208;defined flipping motion are constructed taking advantage of an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. Variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR) analyses and theoretical calculations indicate rapid interconversion of cis and trans conformers at room temperature, while energetically favorable trans conformer exists at low temperature with the metastable cis conformer hidden. The trihexylsilylethynyl&#8208;substituted dimer exhibits bright emission in solution at 616&#8197;nm with quantum yield up to 80&#8201;%, representing the brightest CPP&#8208;based emitter beyond 600&#8197;nm. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of the dimer and C60 is established with negative cooperativity, demonstrating the first example of 1:2 complex from CPP derivatives.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinolide&#8197;IV and Path&#8208;Scouting for Aldgamycin&#8197;N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dozens of macrolide antibiotics are known that differ from each other only in the decoration of an otherwise highly conserved 16&#8208;membered lactone core and in the lateral glycosylation pattern. A unified approach was explored that holds the promise of bringing numerous members of this type into reach from a single &#8220;eastern&#8221; building block.







Abstract
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is provided that a large estate of 16&#8208;membered macrolide antibiotics can be reached by a &#8220;unified&#8221; approach. The key building block was formed on scale by an asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction; its alkene terminus was then converted either into the corresponding methyl ketone by Wacker oxidation or into a chain&#8208;extended aldehyde by catalyst&#8208;controlled branch&#8208;selective asymmetric hydroformylation. These transformations ultimately opened access to two structurally distinct series of macrolide targets. Notable late&#8208;stage maneuvers comprise a rare example of a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of an 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;5&#8208;ol into a 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;5&#8208;one derivative, as well as the elaboration of a tertiary propargylic alcohol into an acyloin by trans&#8208;hydrostannation/Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling. Moreover, this case study illustrates the underutilized possibility of forging complex macrolactone rings by transesterification under essentially neutral conditions.

         <title>Divergent, Strain&#8208;Release Reactions of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Carbinols: Semipinacol or Spiroepoxy Azetidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols can be converted into a diverse range of 1,3,3&#8208;substituted azetidines or spirocyclic epoxides through either a semipinacol rearrangement or via iodohydrin formation followed by spirocyclization. The reaction pathway that operates is determined by the electronic nature of the activating agent.







Abstract
The azetidine moiety is a privileged motif in medicinal chemistry and new methods that access them efficiently are highly sought after. Towards this goal, we have found that azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols, readily obtained from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB), can undergo divergent strain&#8208;release reactions upon N&#8208;activation. Treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride or triflic anhydride triggered a semipinacol rearrangement to give keto 1,3,3&#8208;substituted azetidines. More than 20 examples were explored, enabling us to evaluate selectivity and the migratory aptitude of different groups. Alternatively, treatment of the same alcohols with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of NaI led to iodohydrin intermediates which gave spiroepoxy azetidines upon treatment with base. The electronic nature of the activating agent dictates which pathway operates.

         <title>Dual Ratiometric SERS and Photoacoustic Core&#8211;Satellite Nanoprobe for Quantitatively Visualizing Hydrogen Peroxide in Inflammation and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;satellite gold nanostructure has been developed for dual ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of inflammation/cancer&#8208;related hydrogen peroxide. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease and the treatment progress could be monitored in real&#8208;time using ratiometric SERS and PA imaging.







Abstract
Excessive production of oxidative species alters the normal redox balance and leads to diseases, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. Oxidative species are short&#8208;lived species, which makes direct, precise, and real&#8208;time measurements difficult. Herein, we report a novel core&#8211;satellite gold nanostructure for dual, ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging to enable the precise detection of inflammation/cancer&#8208;related H2O2. The combination of H2O2&#8208;activated second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) PA imaging and SERS imaging enables the differentiation between the inflamed region and normal tissue with high accuracy. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease. Therefore, this core&#8211;satellite nanostructure can not only quantitatively and precisely monitor H2O2 produced in inflammation, tumor, and osteoarthritis in rabbits in real&#8208;time, but can also be used to track the progress of the anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Nanoscale Amperometry Reveals that Only a Fraction of Vesicular Serotonin Content is Released During Exocytosis from Beta Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exocytosis from beta cells monitored by amperometry is compared to the vesicle content assessed from intracellular vesicle impact cytometry to determine if partial release is dominant. Serotonin was used as an electroactive proxy for insulin as it is co&#8208;released. The fraction of release from insulin&#8208;containing granules in beta cells was found to be at most 34&#8201;%, providing a new perspective on insulin release for diabetes research.







Abstract
Recent work has shown that chemical release during the fundamental cellular process of exocytosis in model cell lines is not all&#8208;or&#8208;none. We tested this theory for vesicular release from single pancreatic beta cells. The vesicles in these cells release insulin, but also serotonin, which is detectible with amperometric methods. Traditionally, it is assumed that exocytosis in beta cells is all&#8208;or&#8208;none. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach involving nanoscale amperometric chemical methods to explore the chemical nature of insulin exocytosis. We amperometrically quantified the number of serotonin molecules stored inside of individual nanoscale vesicles (39&#8201;317&#177;1611) in the cell cytoplasm before exocytosis and the number of serotonin molecules released from single cells (13&#8201;310&#177;1127) for each stimulated exocytosis event. Thus, beta cells release only one&#8208;third of their granule content, clearly supporting partial release in this system. We discuss these observations in the context of type&#8208;2 diabetes.

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid RAFT 3D Printing: Photoinduced RAFT polymerization is applied to 3D printing, resulting in rapid prints with a broad window of operation. High resolution surface patterning from the 3D printed objects is readily achieved by reactivation of dormant RAFT functionalities in the polymeric material.







Abstract
RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1&#8197;cm&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe porphyrin with a tethered imidazole is synthesized and beats its imidazole&#8208;free analogue for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. By presenting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular catalytic features, Zn&#8208;air batteries with this Fe porphyrin show equal performance to batteries with Pt/C&#8208;Ir/C. This work underlines unique benefits and promising applications of molecular electrocatalysis in new energy conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe porphyrin 1 as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex 1, which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole&#8208;free analogue 2, with an anodic shift of ORR half&#8208;wave potential by 160&#8197;mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150&#8197;mV to get the benchmark current density at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal FeV=O form the O&#8722;O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of trans HO&#8208;FeV=O, which is less effective to form O&#8722;O bond with hydroxide. As a practical demonstration, we assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery with 1, which shows equal performance to that with Pt/Ir&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Perylene Oligomers with up to 13 Linearly Annulated Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of discrete oligomeric linearly fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) stabilized by peri&#8208;annulation in described. The intrinsic perylene units of the novel PAHs with up to 13(!) linearly fused rings are responsible for colorful and bright photophysical properties.







Abstract
The longer acenes with more than six linearly fused six&#8208;membered rings are still fascinating chemists and physicists because of their unique photophysical properties and their high potential for organic electronics applications. Unfortunately, with increasing size (seven and more rings) these compounds rapidly lose chemical stability. Besides kinetic and chemical stabilization approaches introducing either bulky or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups or both, such systems also have been stabilized by peri&#8208;annulation. Although strictly spoken, these peri&#8208;annulated compounds are no longer real acenes, they have fascinating properties as well. Herein, we describe the first synthesis of a new series of peri&#8208;annulated acenes with up to 13 linearly fused rings, which is unprecedented till date. Furthermore, this new series contains perylene units connected through benzene rings along their [b,k]edges, responsible for unique absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Assembly of Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers on a DNA Origami Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami platforms were used to assemble synthetic supramolecular polymers, retaining their dynamic nature with control over monomer composition and loading and dynamic exchange of molecular cargo. The DNA origami&#8208;templated self&#8208;assembly allows for novel strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly and characterization of synthetic supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Biological processes rely on transient interactions that govern assembly of biomolecules into higher order, multi&#8208;component systems. A synthetic platform for the dynamic assembly of multicomponent complexes would provide novel entries to study and modulate the assembly of artificial systems into higher order topologies. Here, we establish a hybrid DNA origami&#8208;based approach as an assembly platform that enables dynamic templating of supramolecular architectures. It entails the site&#8208;selective recruitment of supramolecular polymers to the platform with preservation of the intrinsic dynamics and reversibility of the assembly process. The composition of the supramolecular assembly on the platform can be tuned dynamically, allowing for monomer rearrangement and inclusion of molecular cargo. This work should aid the study of supramolecular structures in their native environment in real&#8208;time and incites new strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of synthetic building blocks.

         <title>Generation of Elemental Fluorine through the Electrolysis of Copper Difluoride at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of fluorine gas is achieved at room temperature through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. Stable electrolysis with a Ni anode over 100&#8197;h (F2 purity over 99&#8201;%), with the potential to operate under one&#8208;compartment electrolysis, led to a safe and propitious method for the generation of high&#8208;purity fluorine gas for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.







Abstract
The safe generation of F2 gas at room temperature by using simple cell configurations has been the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report generation of F2 gas through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. The CuF2 is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass&#8208;like carbon demonstrate the effect of the absence of the anode during generation of F2 gas owing to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although the Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium&#8208;temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100&#8197;h, achieving an F2 gas purity of over 99&#8201;% with the potential to operate using one&#8208;compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious method for the generation of high&#8208;purity F2 gas for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.

         <title>Chromoselective Photocatalysis Enables Stereocomplementary Biocatalytic Pathways**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green or blue? The wavelength controls the outcome. Chromoselective activation of a carbon nitride generates electron holes with different oxidation potentials that are used for selective oxidation processes. By coupling the photocatalytic reactions with biocatalysis the (S)&#8208; or the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of 1&#8208;phenylethanol was synthesized stereoselectively.







Abstract
Controlling the selectivity of a chemical reaction with external stimuli is common in thermal processes, but rare in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. Here we show that the redox potential of a carbon nitride photocatalyst (CN&#8208;OA&#8208;m) can be tuned by changing the irradiation wavelength to generate electron holes with different oxidation potentials. This tuning was the key to realizing photo&#8208;chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascades that give either the (S)&#8208; or the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of phenylethanol. In combination with an unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, green light irradiation of CN&#8208;OA&#8208;m led to the enantioselective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (99&#8201;% ee). In contrast, blue light irradiation triggered the photocatalytic oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, which in turn was enantioselectively reduced with an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus ruber to form (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (93&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Strong Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two&#8208;Dimensional Na&#8208;In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two layered double perovskites of (PEA)4NaInCl8 and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7, with the highest efficiency under ambient temperature and pressure, were successfully prepared. This study clearly presents the origin of self&#8208;trapped exciton emission and provides a feasible strategy to explore new layered perovskite emitters.







Abstract
Soft lattice and strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently; therefore, LDPs represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emitters for applications in solid&#8208;state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Cs2NaInCl6, we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)4NaInCl8:Sb (PEA=phenethylamine) and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7:Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb&#8208;doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7&#8201;% (monolayer) and 29.3&#8201;% (bilayer), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron.

         <title>Cu(OTf)2&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling of Nitriles and N&#8208;Heterocycles with Arylboronic Acids to Generate Nitrilium and Pyridinium Products**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(OTf)2 promotes the oxidative arylation of nitriles and N&#8208;heterocycles to generate ionic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via reductive elimination from a CuIII complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands to generate nitrilium and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling generally forms C&#8722;N bonds by reductive elimination from metal complexes bearing covalent C&#8208; and N&#8208;ligands. We have identified a Cu&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling that uses a dative N&#8208;ligand in the bond&#8208;forming event, which, in contrast to conventional methods, generates reactive cationic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via transmetalation of an aryl organoboron to a CuII complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands, such as nitriles or N&#8208;heterocycles. Subsequent generation of a putative CuIII complex enables the oxidative C&#8211;N coupling to take place, delivering nitrilium intermediates and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation, and the limitations in the methodology are mechanistically evidenced.

The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation, and the limitations in the methodology are mechanistically evidenced.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Double &#960;&#8208;Extended Undecabenzo[7]helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than double: This paper presents the first double &#960;&#8208;extended undecabenzo[7]helicene. It is a chiral nanographene, displaying an extremely strong light absorption capability with a record high ECD intensity in the visible spectral range known for any discrete PAH compound.







Abstract
This work reports the first double &#960;&#8208;extended undecabenzo[7]helicene 1, which is a large chiral nanographene, composed of 65 fused rings and 186 conjugated carbon atoms. The molecular identity of 1 has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. A wine coloured solution of 1 in dichloromethane absorbs light from ultraviolet to the near infrared, featuring an extremely large molar absorption coefficient of 844&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 573&#8197;nm. Optically pure 1 shows a record high electronic circular dichroism intensity in the visible spectral range (|&#916;&#1013;|=1375&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 430&#8197;nm) known for any discrete polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. These unusual photophysical properties of 1 contrast sharply with those of a mono&#8208;undecabenzo[7]helicene derivative 2.

         <title>Tautomeric Molecule Acts as a &#8220;Sunscreen&#8221; for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harmful UV light and surface defects accelerate the degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A tautomeric &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule can be used to protect the PSC from UV degradation and enable molecular defect passivation (defect formation energy: &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV) through interactions between functional groups and defects. This strategy provides high&#8208;efficiency PSCs with long&#8208;term UV stability.







Abstract
UV light always does great harm to perovskite solar cells, relentlessly degrading perovskites and shortening the lifetime of perovskite devices. Meanwhile, surface defects in perovskite films further accelerate the degradation process and serve as nonradiative charge recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone, not only protects the perovskite solar cell from UV degradation but also enables molecular defect passivation through interaction between functional groups and defects by molecular tautomerism under UV light illumination. Therefore, the sunscreen strategy efficiently enhances the UV endurance of PSCs and improves defect formation energy to &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV. The perovskite solar cell with sunscreen (sunscreen PSC) exhibits outstanding efficiencies of up to 23.09&#8201;% (0.04&#8197;cm2) and 19.73&#8201;% (1.00&#8197;cm2) as well as long&#8208;term UV (UVa: 365&#8197;nm and UVb: 285&#8197;nm) stability.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site&#8208;Selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective dual protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates. The methodologies, as well as the applications of dual&#8208;functionalized protein bioconjugates are highlighted in this review.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates such as traceable therapeutics with improved features. Dual functionalization of proteins allows the incorporation of two different types of functionalities at distinct location(s), which greatly expands the features of native proteins. The attachment and crosstalk of a fluorescence donor and an acceptor dye provides fundamental insights into the folding and structural changes of proteins upon ligand binding in their native cellular environments. Moreover, the combination of drug molecules with different modes of action, imaging agents or stabilizing polymers provides new avenues to design precision protein therapeutics in a reproducible and well&#8208;characterizable fashion. This review aims to give a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this relatively new research area. First, the chemical toolbox for dual functionalization of proteins is discussed and compared. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual&#8208;modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.

         <title>Imaging and Analysis of Isomeric Unsaturated Lipids through Online Photochemical Derivatization of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Double Bonds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid derivatization of lipids using a photoinitiated reaction with singlet oxygen provides insights into the C=C bond location in the precursor lipid through diagnostic CID fragments. This method is compatible with lipidomics workflows and can be adapted for the analysis of tissue extracts and for imaging of isomeric lipids in tissue sections.







Abstract
Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer&#8208;level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments revealing the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI).

         <title>Template&#8208;Mediated Control over Polymorphism in the Vapor&#8208;Assisted Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Powders and Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;mediated MOF&#8208;CVD (metal&#8212;organic framework&#8208;chemical vapor deposition) method was developed for the syntheses of MOFs in both powder and thin&#8208;film forms. The time&#8208;resolved in situ synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that introducing template vapor into the MOF&#8208;CVD process precludes transformation into a dense phase, thus resulting in the porous structure.







Abstract
The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the outcome of their syntheses. Demonstrated here is the use of a template to control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of either ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase, whereas other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved in situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulting ZIF powders and films was studied by N2 and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.

         <title>Inversely Tuning the CO2 Electroreduction and Hydrogen Evolution Activity on Metal Oxide via Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing Zn sites by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) creates various new near the Fermi level electronic states in ZnO. The different electronic states significantly tune both CO2RR and HER activity with an inverse trend. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient metal&#8208;compound based CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.







Abstract
Tuning the electronic states near the Fermi level can effectively facilitate the reaction kinetics. However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO2RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO2RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO2RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.

         <title>Synergetic Lipid Extraction with Oxidative Damage Amplifies Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Destructive Stresses and Enables Rapid Sterilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid sterilization approach using MoS2 nanosheets is reported. The MoS2 nanosheets enabled the extraction of lipids from cell membranes causing subsequent membrane disruptions. Additionally, the nanosheets activated permonosulfate molecules to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that both refreshed the MoS2 surface and attacked the cell membrane, thereby amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms.







Abstract
Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;poison arrowhead&#8221; approach for disinfection based on a nanosheet bacterial inactivation system that acts synergistically to achieve sterilization rates of &gt;99.99&#8201;% (Escherichia coli) over an ultrashort time period (&#8776;0.5&#8197;min). The two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 &#8220;arrowhead&#8221; configuration has a sharp edge structure that enables the vigorous extraction of lipids from cell membranes and subsequent membrane disruptions. In the presence of permonosulfate, a strong oxidant, sulfur vacancies containing MoS2 activate the stable molecules, which in turn produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) from edge sites to basal areas. This process not only scavenges some portion of the phospholipids to allow for MoS2 surface refreshment but also directly attacks proteins thereby inflicting further damage to injured cells and amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms. With small amounts of the new material, we successfully disinfected natural water (&#8776;99.93&#8201;% inactivation in terms of total bacteria) within 30&#8197;s.

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;isoquinolylanilines catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) cyclopentadienyls has been realized in [3+2] annulation with four classes of internal alkynes under mild oxidative condition allowed atroposelective synthesis of biaryl indoles in high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (&gt;50 examples, 71&#8211;96&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Reported herein is the rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of anilines bearing an N&#8208;isoquinolyl directing group for oxidative [3+2] annulation with four classes of internal alkynes, leading to atroposelective indole synthesis via dynamic kinetic annulation with C&#8208;N reductive elimination constituting the stereo&#8208;determining step. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Sulfimidation Mediated by Hydrogen Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A picky ligand: A chiral phenanthroline ligand allows for the site&#8208; and enantioselective imidation (Ns=para&#8208;nitrosulfonyl) of a variety of sulfides. Silver acts in concert with an achiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (1,10&#8208;phen) ligand as the catalytically active center.







Abstract
An enantioselective sulfimidation of 3&#8208;thiosubstituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones was achieved with a stoichiometric nitrene source (PhI=NNs) and a silver&#8208;based catalyst system. Key to the success of the reaction is the use of a chiral phenanthroline ligand with a hydrogen bonding site. The enantioselectivity does not depend on the size of the two substituents at the sulfur atom but only on the binding properties of the heterocyclic lactams. A total of 21 chiral sulfimides were obtained in high yields (44&#8211;99&#8201;%) and with significant enantiomeric excess (70&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The sulfimidation proceeds with high site&#8208;selectivity and can also be employed for the kinetic resolution of chiral sulfoxides. Mechanistic evidence suggests the intermediacy of a heteroleptic silver complex, in which the silver atom is bound to one molecule of the chiral ligand and one molecule of an achiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline. Support for the suggested reaction course was obtained by ESI mass spectrometry, DFT calculations, and a Hammett analysis.

         <title>Polaron Delocalization in Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymers and its Impact on Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomer selection in organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conduction polymers is shown to directly impact their polaron delocalization and consequently their performance in (bio)electronic devices, thus outlining molecular design guidelines for the development of next generation high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side&#8208;reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady&#8208;state OECT performance still lags far behind their all&#8208;donor counterparts. We report three D&#8208;A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all&#8208;donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D&#8208;A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also reveal a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady&#8208;state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. Importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers&#8217; conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.

         <title>Biological Nanopore Approach for Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopore electrochemistry offers a bright prospect for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing by measuring specific interactions between amino acids based on their natural structure and chemistry continuity and diversity. This Minireview focusses on recent advances in biological nanopores from protein unfolding, peptide translocation, amino acid identification to diagnostic application.







Abstract
Proteins are responsible for the occurrence and treatment of many diseases, and therefore protein sequencing will revolutionize proteomics and clinical diagnostics. Biological nanopore approach has proved successful for single&#8208;molecule DNA sequencing, which resolves the identities of 4 natural deoxyribonucleotides based on the current blockages and duration times of their translocations across the nanopore confinement. However, open challenges still remain for biological nanopores to sequentially identify each amino acid (AA) of single proteins due to the inherent complexity of 20 proteinogenic AAs in charges, volumes, hydrophobicity and structures. Herein, we focus on recent exciting advances in biological nanopores for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) from native protein unfolding, control of peptide translocation, AA identification to applications in disease detection.

         <title>Untangling the Complexity of Mixed Lithium/Magnesium Alkyl/Alkoxy Combinations Utilised in Bromine/Magnesium Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining reactivity, NMR spectroscopy and structural studies has cleared the mist surrounding the complex constitutions of mixed Li&#8211;Mg, mixed alkyl&#8211;alkoxo complexes used in metal&#8211;bromine exchange reactions.







Abstract
While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to s&#8208;block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of sBu2Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R=2&#8208;ethylhexyl), where unusually both sBu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2&#8208;FG&#8208;C6H4)2(OR)}2] (FG=OMe; NMe2) or a homoaryl [(THF)4Li2Mg(4&#8208;FG&#8208;C6H4)4] (FG=OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk&#8208;type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMgsBu2(OR)], alkyl rich [Li2MgsBu4] and Mg(OR)2, with [Li2MgsBu4] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.

         <title>Exclusively Relativistic: Periodic Trends in the Melting and Boiling Points of Group&#8197;12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very recently has it become possible to obtain accurate melting and boiling points from quantum&#8208;chemical simulations. These show that the periodic trends observed for the Group&#8197;12 elements are exclusively relativistic in nature, which can be rationalized in terms of the relativistic change in the corresponding cohesive energies.







Abstract
First&#8208;principles simulations can advance our understanding of phase transitions but are often too costly for the heavier elements, which require a relativistic treatment. Addressing this challenge, we recently composed an indirect approach: A precise incremental calculation of absolute Gibbs energies for the solid and liquid with a relativistic Hamiltonian that enables an accurate determination of melting and boiling points (MPs and BPs). Here, we apply this approach to the Group&#8197;12 elements Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn, whose MPs and BPs we calculate with a mean absolute deviation of only 5&#8201;% and 1&#8201;%, respectively, while we confirm the previously predicted liquid aggregate state of Cn. At a non&#8208;relativistic level of theory, we obtain surprisingly similar MPs and BPs of 650&#177;30&#8197;K and 1250&#177;20&#8197;K, suggesting that periodic trends in this group are exclusively relativistic in nature. Ultimately, we discuss these results and their implication for Groups&#8197;11 and&#8197;14.

         <title>Kinetics of H2 Adsorption at the Metal&#8211;Support Interface of Au/TiO2 Catalysts Probed by Broad Background IR Absorbance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FTIR studies during H2 activation over Au/TiO2 present clear spectroscopic evidence of H2 activation between Au and Ti&#8208;OH groups at the metal&#8211;support interface. Electron transfer to the support shifts the broad background absorbance (BBA), enabling the differentiation of activation barriers forH2(D2) adsorption and surface (Ti&#8208;OH) H/D exchange.







Abstract
H2 adsorption on Au catalysts is weak and reversible, making it difficult to quantitatively study. We demonstrate H2 adsorption on Au/TiO2 catalysts results in electron transfer to the support, inducing shifts in the FTIR background. This broad background absorbance (BBA) signal is used to quantify H2 adsorption; adsorption equilibrium constants are comparable to volumetric adsorption measurements. H2 adsorption kinetics measured with the BBA show a lower Eapp value (23&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) for H2 adsorption than previously reported from proxy H/D exchange (33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). We also identify a previously unreported H&#8208;O&#8208;H bending vibration associated with proton adsorption on electronically distinct Ti&#8208;OH metal&#8208;support interface sites, providing new insight into the nature and dynamics of H2 adsorption at the Au/TiO2 interface.

         <title>Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Phenalenyl Radical and Its Dimeric Double Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of a neutral spin&#8208;delocalized carbon&#8208;nanoring radical, achieved by integration of an open&#8208;shell graphene fragment phenalenyl into cycloparaphenylene (CPP). We show that spin distribution in this hydrocarbon partially extends from the phenalenyl onto the CPP segment as an interplay of steric and electronic effects. The resulting geometry is reminiscent of a diamond ring, with pseudo&#8208;perpendicular arrangement of the radial and the planar &#960;&#8208;surface. Remarkably, this geometry gives rise to a steric effect that governs a highly selective dimerization pathway, yielding a giant double nanohoop. Its &#960;&#8208;framework made of 158 sp2&#8208;carbon atoms was unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which revealed a three&#8208;segment CPP&#8211;peropyrene&#8211;CPP structure. This nanocarbon shows a fluorescence profile characteristic of peropyrene, regardless of which segment gets excited. These results in conjunction with DFT suggest that adjustment of the size of the CPP segments in this double nanohoop could deliver true donor&#8211;acceptor systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Sheath of Li Ions by Hydrogen Bonds for Highly Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium is regarded as the most promising candidate for anodes in batteries. However, the performance of Li anode is extremely affected by the solvation of Li ions, leading to preferential reduction of the solvation sheath and subsequent formation of fragile solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), Li dendrites and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Here, we propose a novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, through introducing intermolecular hydrogen bonds with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent by small amount additives. The addition of such hydrogen bonds reduced the LUMO energy level of anions in electrolyte, promoted the formation of robust SEI, reduced the amount of free solvent molecules and enhanced stability of electrolytes. Based on this strategy, flat and dense lithium deposition was obtained. Even under lean electrolytes, at a current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2 with a fixed capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8208;2, the Li&#8208;Cu cells showed impressive CE of 99.2%. The Li&#8208;LiFePO4 full cells showed long&#8208;term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles at 1C, with a total capacity loss of only 15 mAh g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

The addition of such hydrogen bonds reduced the LUMO energy level of anions in electrolyte, promoted the formation of robust SEI, reduced the amount of free solvent molecules and enhanced stability of electrolytes. Based on this strategy, flat and dense lithium deposition was obtained. Even under lean electrolytes, at a current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2 with a fixed capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8208;2, the Li&#8208;Cu cells showed impressive CE of 99.2%. The Li&#8208;LiFePO4 full cells showed long&#8208;term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles at 1C, with a total capacity loss of only 15 mAh g&#8208;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we introduce the tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different liberated levels in atomically precise Au nanoclusters. Our results reveal that a singly open Ag site on the Au19Ag4 cluster improves the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides and sequent CO2 insertion, while the partially exposed Ag site on the Au20Ag1 cluster exhibits a weak affinity for epoxides and poor efficiency of CO2 capture. Structural tunability imparted by atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in chemical utilization of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>New synthetic approaches to N&#8208;aryl and &#960;&#8208;expanded diketopyrrolopyrroles as new building blocks for organic optoelectronic materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of  N  &#8208;aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward  N  &#8208;aryl DPPs through H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope. Sixteen  N  &#8208;aryl DPPs, including phenyl, furan and thiophene as flanking aromatic groups, were synthesized with yields up to 78%. These  N  &#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in both solutions and solid states, with quantum yields up to 96% and 40%, respectively. Secondly, we show that the reaction between H&#8208;DPP and diaryliodonium salt can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)  2  as catalyst. Nine &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs were obtained in 27&#8208;61% yields. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties with hole mobility of 0.71 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , demonstrating that they are useful building blocks for high performance organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulative Electronic States around Ruthenium/Ruthenium Disulphide Heterointerfaces for Efficient Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretical calculations unveil the charge redistribution over abundant interfaces and the enhanced electronic states of Ru/RuS  2  heterostructure. The resulting surface electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites display optimized adsorption behavior toward diverse reaction intermediates, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers. Experimentally, for the first time the laminar Ru/RuS  2  heterostructure is rationally engineered by virtue of the synchronous reduction and sulfurization under eutectic salt system. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201 mV @ 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and HER (45 mV @ 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501 V @ 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ). The in&#8208;depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispecific Aptamer Chimeras Enable Targeted Protein Degradation on Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to regulate membrane protein abundance offers great opportunities for developing therapeutic sites for various diseases. Herein, we develop a platform for targeted degradation of membrane&#8208;associated proteins using bispecific aptamer chimeras that bind both the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;shuttling receptor (IGFIIR) and the targeted membrane&#8208;bound proteins of interest. We demonstrate that the aptamer chimeras can efficiently and quickly shuttle the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of Met and PTK&#8208;7 to lysosomes and degrade them through the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for using the easily synthesized aptamer materials for biochemical research and for potential therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N bond coupling to convert CO  2  &#160;and N  2  &#160;molecules into urea under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to harsh industrial processes. However, the adsorption and activation of inert gas molecules and then driving C&#8208;N coupling reaction is energetically challenging. Herein, a novel Mott&#8208;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO  4  &#160;heterostructures are designed and realize the remarkable urea yield rate of 5.91 mmol h  &#8208;1  &#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;and Faradaic efficiency of 12.55% at &#8208;0.4 V vs. RHE. Comprehensive analysis confirms the emerged space&#8208;charge region in heterostructural interface not only facilitates the targeted adsorption and activation of CO  2  &#160;and N  2  &#160;molecules on generated the local nucleophilic and electrophilic region but also effectively suppresses CO poisoning and the formation of endothermic *NNH intermediate, which thus guarantees the exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates and generated CO via desired C&#8208;N coupling reaction to form urea precursor *NCON* intermediate. This work provides an encouraging inspiration to promote urea electrosynthesis by electrochemical C&#8208;N coupling reaction under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated copolymers that shouldn&#8217;t be</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple studies have explored using cage silsesquioxanes (SQs) as backbone elements in hybrid polymers motivated by their well&#8208;defined structures, physical and mechanical properties. As part of this general exploration, we reported unexpected photophysical properties of copolymers derived from divinyl double decker (DD) SQs, [vinyl(Me)Si(O  0.5  )  2  ][PhSiO  1.5  ]  8  [(O  0.5  )  2  Si(Me)vinyl] (vinylDDvinyl). These copolymers exhibit strong emission red&#8208;shifts from model compounds and implying unconventional conjugation, despite vinyl(Me)Si(O&#8208;)  2  siloxane bridges. In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation; we explored Heck catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;ladder(LL)&#8208;vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O  0.5  )  2  [PhSiO  1.5  ]  4  (O  0.5  )  2  Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br where Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br = 1,4&#8208;dibromobenzene, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl, 4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;  p  &#8208;terphenyl, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;  trans  &#8208;stilbene, 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene, 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene and 2,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]thiophene. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show  30&#8208;60 nm  emission red&#8208;shifts  beyond  those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs  despite lacking a true cage  . Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL&#8208;co&#8208;thiophene, bithiophene and thienothiophene with 10 mol% F  4  TCNQ, suggesting potential as p&#8208;type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors. Brominating DD/LL&#8208;co&#8208;phenyl polymer vinyl groups eliminates emission red&#8208;shifts. Zn debromination thereafter restores vinyl groups and emission red&#8208;shifts but brominated phenyls remain providing potential access to families of &#8220;hairy&#8221; conjugated SQ polymers.</dc:description>

In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation; we explored Heck catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;ladder(LL)&#8208;vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O  0.5  )  2  [PhSiO  1.5  ]  4  (O  0.5  )  2  Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br where Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br = 1,4&#8208;dibromobenzene, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl, 4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;  p  &#8208;terphenyl, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;  trans  &#8208;stilbene, 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene, 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene and 2,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]thiophene. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show  30&#8208;60 nm  emission red&#8208;shifts  beyond  those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs  despite lacking a true cage  . Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL&#8208;co&#8208;thiophene, bithiophene and thienothiophene with 10 mol% F  4  TCNQ, suggesting potential as p&#8208;type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors. Brominating DD/LL&#8208;co&#8208;phenyl polymer vinyl groups eliminates emission red&#8208;shifts. Zn debromination thereafter restores vinyl groups and emission red&#8208;shifts but brominated phenyls remain providing potential access to families of &#8220;hairy&#8221; conjugated SQ polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rod&#8208;Packing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Suitable Pore Confinement for Benchmark Ethane/Ethylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of new materials for separating ethane from ethylene is a critical enterprise in the chemical industry. It still remains a daunting challenge to target both high C  2  H  6  adsorption and selectivity in a C  2  H  6  &#8208;selective material. Herein, we report a reversible solid&#8208;state transformation in a labile hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework to generate a new rod&#8208;packing desolvated framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1), leading to the suitable cavity spaces and functional surfaces to optimally interact with C  2  H  6  . ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 thus exhibits simultaneously high C  2  H  6  uptake (88 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 bar and 298 K) and C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  selectivity (2.25), notably higher than HOF&#8208;76a and most of top&#8208;performing materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that the suitable cage&#8208;like cavities and functional sites to synergistically &#8220;match&#8221; better with C  2  H  6  provide stronger multipoint interactions with C  2  H  6  than C  2  H  4  . In combination with its high stability and ultralow water uptake, this material can efficiently capture C  2  H  6  from 50/50 C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  mixtures at ambient conditions under 60% RH, providing a record polymer&#8208;grade C  2  H  4  productivity of 0.98 mmol g  &#8208;1  reported so far, as evidenced through the breakthrough experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Following electroenzymatic hydrogen production by rotating ring disk electrochemistry and mass spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;processing metalloenzymes are of interest to future bio&#8208; and bioinspired technologies. Of particular importance are hydrogenases and nitrogenases, which both produce molecular hydrogen (H2) from proton (H+) reduction. Here, we report on the use of rotating ring disk electrochemistry (RRDE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to follow the production of H2  and isotopes produced from deuteron (D+) reduction (HD and D2) using the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from  Clostridium pasteurianum, a model hydrogen&#8208;evolving metalloenzyme. This facilitates enzymology studies independent of non&#8208;innocent chemical reductants. We anticipate that these approaches will be of value in resolving the catalytic mechanisms of H2  &#8208;producing metalloenzymes and the design of bioinspired catalysts for H2  production and N2  fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers on Surface and the Chiral Assembly&#8208;Induced Enantioselective Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although post&#8208;functionalization is extensively used to introduce diverse functional groups into supramolecular polymers (SPs) in solution, post&#8211;functionalization of SPs on surfaces still remains unexplored. Here we achieved the on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two SPs derived from 5,10,15&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;20&#8208;bromophenyl porphyrin (Br&#8208;TPyP) via cross&#8208;coupling reactions on Au(111). The ladder&#8208;shaped, Cu&#8208;coordinated SPs preformed from Br&#8208;TPyP were functionalized through Heck reaction with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl. In the absence of Cu, Br&#8208;TPyP formed chiral SPs as two enantiomers via self&#8208;assembly, which were functionalized via divergent cross&#8208;coupling reaction with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (ICBP). Surprisingly, this reaction was discovered as an enantioselective on&#8208;surface reaction induced by the chirality of SPs. Mechanistic analysis and DFT calculations indicated that after debromination of Br&#8208;TPyP and the first addition of ICBP, only one attack direction of ICBP to the chiral SP intermediate is permissive in the second addition step due to the steric hindrance, which guaranteed the high enantioselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2&#8208;Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron&#160;oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy&#8208; and waste&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H  2  O  2  &#160;production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four&#8208;electron&#160;pathway leading to low H  2  O  2  selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O  2  &#8208;entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two&#8208;electron&#160;oxygen reduction electrocatalysis.&#160;The honeycomb&#160;carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H  2  O  2  &#160;selectivity of 97.3%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an&#160;ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8201;A&#8201;g  &#8722;1  , surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron&#160;oxygen reduction reaction.&#160;The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups&#160;facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

Impressively, this catalyst achieves an&#160;ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8201;A&#8201;g  &#8722;1  , surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron&#160;oxygen reduction reaction.&#160;The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups&#160;facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prediction of Novel van der Waals Boron Oxides with Superior Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials and their predictions are attracting increasing attention because of their structural diversity and complexity. Using the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal structure prediction method combined with the first&#8208;principles calculations, here we discovered new van der Waals (VDW) layered 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (18MR) boron oxide B  2  O  3  polymorphs as high&#8208;performance NLO materials. 18MR&#8209;B  2  O  3  with the  AA  and  AB  stackings are potential DUV NLO materials. The superior performing  AB  stacking results in an unprecedentedly high second harmonic generation coefficient of 1.63 pm/V, the largest among the NLO materials with a DUV absorption edge and being three times larger than that of the advanced DUV NLO material KBe  2  BO  3  F  2  and comparable to that of &#946;&#8209;BaB  2  O  4  . The  AB  stacking&#8217;s unusually large birefringence of 0.196 at 400&#160;nm guarantees the phase&#8208;matching wavelength &#955;  PM  to reach this material&#8217;s extreme absorption edge of ~154&#160;nm. The performance can be tuned by varying the layer stackings in 18MR&#8209;B  2  O  3  , which provides an efficient approach for further enhancement. We predict that excellent NLO properties of VDW crystals can be explored in 2D and 3D with promising possibilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the local charge distribution of Ni active sites for urea oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for large proportion of energy consumption. Electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives for OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, the sluggish UOR kinetics has not yet unlocked its potential in practical use. Herein, we developed a tungsten (W)&#8208;introduced Nickel (Ni) based catalyst (Ni&#8208;WO  x  ), which possessed superior activity towards UOR. The Ni&#8208;WO  x&#160;  catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  at 1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and high turnover frequency of 0.11 s  &#8208;1  , which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. Electrochemical studies, in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the W regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni  3+  sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni&#8208;WO  x&#160;  into a CO  2&#160;  flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16 V accompanying with ~98% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide, suggesting the great potential of high efficient UOR to enhance the CO  2  utilization and economic viability.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Zinc&#8208;doping on the Reduction of the Hot&#8208;carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast hot&#8208;carrier cooling process in the solar&#8208;absorbers fundamentally limits the photon&#8208;energy conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop the solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination level, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 10  17  cm  &#8208;3  is found to be ~3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for 500&#8208;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaching the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation process. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which are valuable for the further development of practical perovskite hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics  .</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticle assisted cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry (MS) promises small metabolite profiling as tool of the future and calls for comprehensive understanding of key procedures to enhance its capability. Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites combining theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)&#8208;MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders, to establish the rules of cation&#8208;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces, to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions, to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in analysis of large biomolecules as honored by Nobel Prize in 2002, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Superatomic Nanoclusters Ag47 Induced by the Ligation of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time silver nanoclusters containing Ag(0) atoms protected by amino acids have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Chiral superatomic silver nanoclusters [Ag  47  L  12  (C&#8801;C  t  Bu)  16  ]BF  4  (L =  l  &#8208;/  d  &#8208; valine or  l  &#8208;/  d  &#8208; isoleucine) have been prepared by reducing AgC&#8801;C  t  Bu and amino acids (AAs) with NaBH  4  . Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that these clusters have  T  symmetry, and the Ag  47  metal kernel can be viewed as a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag  17  ) surrounded with six W&#8208;shaped Ag  5  units. The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18&#8208;electron systems, which suggests they are superatomic clusters. Their superatomic nature with a 1S  2  1P  6  1D  10  configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Crystallization of Rare Earth Ions into Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Rare Earth Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For rare&#8208;earth separation, selective crystallization into metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offers new opportunities. Especially important is the development of MOF platforms with high selectivity toward target ions. Here we report a MOF platform (CPM&#8208;66) with low&#8208;coordination&#8208;number environment for rare&#8208;earth ions. This platform is highly responsive to the size variation of rare&#8208;earth ions and shows exceptional ion&#8208;size selectivity during crystallization. CPM&#8208;66 family are based on M  3  O trimers (M = 6&#8208;coordinated Sc, In, Tm&#8208;Lu) that are rare for lanthanides. We show that the size matching between urea&#8208;type solvents and metal ions is crucial for their successful synthesis. We further show that CPM&#8208;66 enables a dramatic multi&#8208;fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM&#8208;29 with 7&#8208;coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low&#8208;coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high&#8208;efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.</dc:description>

We further show that CPM&#8208;66 enables a dramatic multi&#8208;fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM&#8208;29 with 7&#8208;coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low&#8208;coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high&#8208;efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of a Macropinocytosis&#8208;Inducing Peptide Potentiated by Medium&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Disulfide Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macropinocytosis is among ubiquitous cellular uptake mechanisms of peptide&#8208;based intracellular delivery. Due to its capability of engulfing large macromolecules, macropinocytosis shows promise as a route for the intracellular uptake of biomacromolecules and nanoparticles. We previously reported SN21, a peptide derived from the N&#8208;terminus of stromal cell&#8208;derived growth factor 1&#945; (SDF&#8208;1&#945;), as a potent macropinocytosis inducer. In this work, we obtained the 8&#8208;residue analog P4A bearing higher macropinocytosis induction ability. P4A contains vital cysteine residues in its sequence, which immediately reacts with cystine in culture medium to convert into its oxidized forms, including the intramolecularly oxidized form (oxP4A) as the dominant and active species. The conjugate of oxP4A with membrane lytic peptide LK15 delivered bioactive proteins into cells; notably, this peptide delivered functional proteins fused with a negatively charged protein tag at a significantly reduced amount (up to nanomolar range) without compromising the delivery efficiency and the cellular activities of delivered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallated graphynes as a new class of photofunctional 2D organometallic nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting much attention due to their excellent electronic and optical properties. Here, we report the first experimental preparation of two free&#8208;standing mercurated graphyne nanosheets via the interface&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method, which integrates both the advantages of metal center and graphyne. The continuous large&#8208;area nanosheets derived from the chemical growth show the layered molecular structural arrangement, controllable thickness and enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which result in their stable and outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption (SA) properties (at both 532 and 1064 nm). The passively Q&#8208;switched (PQS) performances of these two nanosheets as the saturable absorbers are comparable to or higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D nanomaterials (such as graphene, black phosphorus, MoS2, &#947;&#8208;graphyne, etc.). Our results illustrate that the two metallated graphynes could act not only as a new class of 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials, but also as inexpensive and easily available optoelectronic materials for device fabrication.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) and 2D structures by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) can form fascinating hierarchical structures through secondary self&#8208;assembly. But examples of 3D structures formed via hierarchical self&#8208;assembly are rare. Here we report seeded growth experiments in decane of a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) BCP with an amphiphilic corona forming block in which lenticular platelets grow into classic spherulite&#8208;like uniform colloidally stable structures. These 3D objects are spherically symmetric on the exterior, but asymmetric near the core, where there is a more open structure consisting of sheaf&#8208;like leaves. The most remarkable aspect of these experiments is that growth stops at different stages of growth process, depending upon how much unimer is added in the seeded growth step. The system provides a model for studying spherulitic growth where real&#8208;time observations on their growth at different stages remains challenging.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Polyfunctional Triarylmethanes and 1,1&#8208;Diarylalkanes by Sequential Cross&#8208;Coupling of Benzal Diacetates with Organozinc Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of functionalized triarylmethane and 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane derivatives were prepared via a transition metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot and two&#8208;step procedure, involving the reaction of various benzal diacetates with organozinc reagents. A sequential cross&#8208;coupling is enabled by changing the solvent from THF to toluene, and a two&#8208;step S  N  1&#8208;type mechanism was proposed and evidenced by experimental study. The synthetic utility of the method is further demonstrated by the synthesis of several biologically relevant molecules, such as an anti&#8208;tuberculosis agent, an anti&#8208;breast cancer agent, a precursor of a sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, and a FLAP inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of&#160;Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme  E. coli  &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structures and Catalytic Mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Diaminohexanoate Dehydrogenase and Rational Engineering for Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) have shown considerable potential as biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids. However, compared to the widely studied &#945;&#8208;AADHs, limited knowledge is available about &#946;&#8208;AADHs that enable the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Herein we report the crystal structures of a  l  &#8208;  erythro  &#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of &#946;&#8208;AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from &#945;&#8208;AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity by 110&#8208;800 times toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt; 99%  ee  ) and high isolated yields (86%&#8208;87%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity by 110&#8208;800 times toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&amp;gt; 99%  ee  ) and high isolated yields (86%&#8208;87%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A single pot template reaction towards a manganese based T1 contrast agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA,  MnL  Me  , and studied the most important physicochemical properties  in vitro  .  MnL  Me  displays optimized,  r  1  relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64 MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400MHz) and an enhanced  r  1  b  = 21.1 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  (20 MHz, 298 K, pH 7.4) upon binding to BSA (K  a  = 4.2 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8208;1  ).  In vivo  studies show that  MnL  Me  is cleared intact into the bladder through hepatobiliary excretion and a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist.  MnL  Me  shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures have remained elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of a cyclic AIP (cAIP) that controls endospore formation in  Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum  . Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with mutant strain, we reveal that a homodetic cyclopeptide is the genuine chemical mediator. Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid  S  &#8594;  N  shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial cAIPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Size&#8208;Controlled m&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Urea Oligomers and Their Biomimetic Chloride Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The m&#8208;pyridine urea (mPU) oligomer was constructed by using the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed by the pyridine nitrogen atom and the NH of urea and the intermolecular hydrogen bond of the terminal carbonyl group and the NH of urea. Due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonds, mPU oligomer folds and exhibits strong self&#8208;assembly behavior. Affected by folding, mPU oligomer generates a twisted plane, and one of its important features is that the carbonyl group of the urea group orientates outwards from the twisted plane, while the NHs tend to direct inward.   This feature is beneficial to NH attraction for electron&#8208;rich species. Among them, trimer  1a  self&#8208;assembles into helical nanotubes, and can efficiently transport chloride ions. This study provides a novel and efficient strategy for constructing self&#8208;assembled biomimetic materials for electron&#8208;rich species transmission.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, a tripeptide con&#8208;sisting of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine and one molecule of alanine</title>

         <dc:description>DON (6&#8208;Diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine), a diazo&#8208;containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60 years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic&#160;pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala&#8211;DON&#8211;DON which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr&#8208;93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>
